{"iN63V5NDLMs": "I was going to do another question and answer video but I really didn't have any there's any really specific questions about create X so to speak some people are confused about mixing ratios and things like that you know your typical 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 all that stuff what's what and how much and how to do that and so I'm going to try to explain that real quick this is my test piece I was doing and I use just a regular opaque blue and I poured some into some little bottles and then I mixed one with future and I mixed one with them create a center but I mix them at different ratios with the with the create X thinner I mixed it two to one two parts of paint to one part of the reducer the first number is always the paint always always always always the paint that's the industry standard just think of it this way the first thing you pour in your bottle is your paint that's the first thing you you always go to is your paint okay then you add your thinner or reducer so just remember it in that way the first number is always the paint and I've seen people get that backwards and wrong that would cause a major catastrophe because you would have double the error so it's real simple just the first number is always the paint the second number is always the thinner or reduce you now on the future I mixed it one to one or half and half one part future or one part paint and an equal amount of future one to one but don't worry about percentages and all that just think of parts is the easiest way to do it one part is to two parts out or two parts is to one part that makes it a lot easier you're not having to worry about amounts announces and this and that really that's not important you kind of mix by how much paint you think you need to make now you didn't get cups of all different sizes that have these graduations on it and I've seen her people get really messed up on this but this is actually very very simple you know this happens to be a big cup this is a 32 ounce cup and up to here is 24 ounces of paint that's not important these are these are your one your two-part mixing ratio bars here and it makes it really simple if you're mixing one to one you know if you're mixing like I did with the future you know one part paint to one part future or thinner then you would fill the cup up to us just pick a number you know however much paint you think you need say you need about this much paint or somewhere in here and I'll just go to the two so you would fill your paint up to the two on this bar that's your paint bar this is your thinner bar you would leave that paint in there and then fill your reducer up to the two you always match the number you know if you're feeling if you're going to put all the way up to four and paint then you would go all the way up to four leaving that paint in there and add that much reducer you always just match the numbers you don't pour in pain pour it out and then think that's I'm mixing a two to one so I need to fill this two to pour it out and then fill it to one or you don't remove the paint from the bucket you actually fill to a specific number these are just general guide numbers these aren't ounces or nothing these are just numbers that you can match the apparently took depending on how much paint you're willing to mix if you're doing two to one two parts paint to one part thinner or reducer then you again you would just simply fill up to how much you roughly you think you need and I'll say I fill my paint up to three then you would fill continue and fill up to three with reducer and that would give you a two to one or two to one mixture same but four to one you want four parts Hank to one part thinner you would fill to a random number say five then you would put your thinner in leaving that paint in there until you hit the five on the thinner bar and that would give you a four to one ratio mix and it's real simple you get to three parts and it's not much different it's just that you have three components you have a resin or a paint or a clear your second number generally is your hardener because that doesn't change if you're say you're using the matrix clear it's four to one no matter what it's always four parts clear to one part hardener so it would be confusing if you did clear then reduce it and then try to guess what your hardener supposed to be to match to get back to where you're supposed to you know your four to one so I would always I always do it in the way that you mix it this the same is with the two-to-one you I always mix if I'm doing a three-part clear I always makes the clear and the hardener and then reduce it to the consistency that I want so if I want to do a matrix is for two one four two one you know so it'd be four parts clear or four parts paint one part hardener and then if you want to add one part thinner you would go to that line so you would go if you're doing a four one one or let's say you're doing a four one two four parts I'd go to pick a number of just generally how much I'm wanting to end up with you know I want to have maybe this much material when I'm done that's three so I would go to three with the clear leave that in and then fill up this high with hardener and then fill up to here with a reducer and that would give you a 4:1 one or two excuse me ratio and hopefully that's clear I hope I'm making that clear you don't pour in paint and pour it out and then pour in reducer poured out you know nothing like that and you don't get goat-like for one one you know it's not like that you match the numbers across and that gives you that ratio you know it's you would always fill whatever you fill this to you're going to fill your other components to that same number four four four two two two six six six always the same number just remember that same with the two part four four four four four four that's going to give you your different ratios so I hope that that's clear the main thing to remember is when you write down ratios are you telling somebody your ratio or you're reading a ratio it's always paint thinner or paint hardener which is a set you know that's unchangeable or clear hardener thinner you know and just think of it how you an easy way to remembers think of how you mix it you don't typically pour thinner in a bottle and then add paint you always pour your paint and then you add your thinner to the desired consistencies I'm going to put up a video later on hopefully the day of what some pain and stuff and just what I'm doing and I'm kind of think I have an idea of what I'm going to paint the color I've been working so many hours and I'm working two jobs essentially so I haven't been able to do much of anything but anyway hopefully this clears some stuff up talk to y'all later bye", "4Vx9DP7bKfs": "what's up guys today I want to talk to you about the dilution ratio a lot of question people don't how to do it so of course you can go on the internet and download a picture with dilution ratio or you can buy a bottle the Rihanna site will be dilution ratio but it's actually very easy to to do it by yourself you don't need a calculator you can do it in your head it's actually very easy and just because I like to use chemicals which I can dilute I don't like to use the straight chemicals like this super clean I only use this one and I always dilute four to one it's four part water one part of super clean if I use Chemical Guys nonsense I also dilute so I only use chemicals which I can diluting the really work for me like super clean you can buy a gallon for about twelve dollars something like this so if you calculate if you dilute one gallon for to one it's you gonna make five gallons of itself twelve dollars a kill and you divided by five it's about two and a half dollars per gallon it's really cheap it's dirt cheap so and how the dilution ratio works let's say you need to dilute four to one or five to one or six to one let's mean this is water and this is product so what are you doing four to one you're doing four plus one equal 5 so and depends what kind of battle you have if it's let's say it's 32 ounces so totally to you divided by 5 and basically I'm not using the calculate I always do in my head up approximate it's it's not something like that is supposed to be diluted by exact so if I divide 32 by 5 it's gonna be approximately six six six point two six point three something like that so basically you take 32 ounces bottle minus six you put 26 26 ounces in your bottle and six ounces of the product that's how it works another way if you if you are using the same battle for the same chemical all the time you can and it's don't have nothing like my bottle it's just a clear bottle so you can measure it like I did this is the 26 ounces of water so I always put water first and then the product so this is gonna be 26 ounces if I add six more answers of the product it's gonna be up to here so basically it's a full but it's really easy for me so I don't have to measure it all the time the water in the chemicals I'm I just put pour water up to this line and then the rest is a chemical and then you shake it a little bit and the it's ready another thing I use the tape here I put a tape and I write on a tape what kind of chemicals is it so in the future for you decide you can use this bottle for something else you can always take out this tape and you can put a new tape and write other stuff wherever chemicals is gonna be there if you're gonna write on a bottle it's gonna be really hard to remove it and it's gonna be always confused in what kind chemical system so I guess it's it's not really hard to to get it of course you can you can download the picture with dilution ratio for 16-ounce 32 one gear on five-gallon it's basically up to you but all the time you have to dig in your form look for the picture to see what's the dilution ratio I think this is really easy basically you you can calculate a couple seconds in your head because it's not supposed to be 100% accurate it's supposed to be approximate so this is it thank you please subscribe", "hwxs_lgNGaM": "hey everybody is Brandon with Lowcountry hydro paint wanted to take a minute and show you some of you new guys how to go about mixing your clear coats have a lot of people asking about mixing clear to or how you mix certain paints and you've probably seen these mixing cups before and you may not understand what all these numbers are so just wanted to go over with you how this works all these scales on the side of these cups have guys and columns that break down the ratios that your paint is mixed in 8 to 1 6 to 1 5 to 1 more commonly and you're going to be dealing with 4 to 1 2 to 1 or possibly 1 to 1 basically the way these cups work this is a quart sized cup so if you're going to deal with 4 to 1 clear coat you would come to the 4 to 1 scale and you're going to be working within this column even though it's 4 to 1 to 1/2 to 1 to 2 you're pretty much just going to be working with these first two numbers occasionally you work with the third one but not usually so basically with this being a quart sized cup if you look at it about right here is about halfway so let's say we wanted to mix up half a quart of clear coat which would be a good bit for smaller amounts you can or for smaller objects you can make smaller amounts but basically what we would do is we wanted to make a half a quart of clear we would come up on this 4 to 1 scale in the 4 column we would mix from the bottom or pour from the bottom to this 7 that's going to be your clear coat then what we're going to do is we're going to make up the difference from this 7 to this 7 in the one column so your clear coat comes to here and then you pour your heart nerve to here that gives you a 4 to 1 ratio and it works like that on all of the other columns if it's three to one or two to one however you're setting this is not represented in ounces this is simply part you know this is 4 to 1 but these are equal parts if you come over to the one-to-one scale you'll see on a one-to-one that from here to here is the same distance as here to here that's one-to-one so anyway just a quick video to show you guys how these cuts work if you got them use them if you don't you can just use a regular something that measures in ounces and you can just do the math yourself on a one-to-one ratio you would be making six ounces of clear and then fill it in from here to twelve ounces with your hardener that would be one to one okay hope this helps umm if you guys have any questions hit me up on the forum have a good day", "Ne78DegFiuI": "[Music] hey everybody this is sherry with cpr craft pray repeat and i've got a i made hot cocoa and i will put a uh recipe in the description box for you it's the same one that i use just with smaller measurements because nobody needs as much hot cocoa as i made that was silly my husband's like what in the world are you doing but i have given a lot of it away so if you want to make a lot to give away you know as gifts or whatever or just to hand out to people during when during the cold weather um just double the recipe because that's essentially what i did and so i'll be back in one second to share with you how i'm sending these out be right back all right everyone this is the first one that i'm going to share with you and these are just plastic containers that i got from amazon i will link them in the description box for you i um share some meals with some of the elderly in our church when i cook for us i just share with them some of what we have and they eat like good teeny birds so this is a small container like this is way more than they normally eat but this is the smallest size i could get i believe this one is eight ounces i'm not exactly sure then there's a 16 and a 32 ounce container that they come in i also used a 16 ounce container and set that to the police station so if you're going to share with a group of people you may want to purchase the larger containers and then i didn't use the 32 ounce one because this this is really a lot of hot cocoa mix and so what i did was i went to my publisher on my computer and i downloaded some of my i transferred some of my images from nitwit collections that i own and just made them into a circle and they had a circle on my on my program so i could make sure everything fit inside that circle and this is this lid i believe is a four inch i used a four inch circle and then i used one of my die cuts to cut it out and it has here the hot cocoa mix and two heaping teaspoons to one cup of hot water one caught like a coffee mug type of hot water and this is the first one that i made here is the second one and they all have the directions written right on them let me zoom out here a little bit so i can share some more of them with you and here is the third one and the fourth one i absolutely love i love nitwit collections and all of these came from different well these two came from the same set and then these are from different sets and they have all kinds they just came out with a nutcracker set that i want and will probably be buying but when i buy them i'm going to tell you i do not buy the seven dollar seventeen dollar set i mean it has everything in it i don't use the letters you know i don't you know i stick with i think it's like seven dollars for what i get i mean it's not expensive at all 779 is the nitwit collection that i'm going to purchase so it's not expensive at all and they've got a muay christmas collection that i'm also going to purchase and right now it's only three dollars and 49 cents and it comes with four different towels some buttons some background papers because all of these background papers came from the sets as well i mean everything and i just printed them out on my printer with some cardstock and i used the inexpensive cardstock that you can get from walmart super easy and it's got the directions there's a ton of hot cocoa in here and so it's just a perfect amount to give to them it will last them all winter you know because i mean they don't you know they don't drink a lot of hot cocoa but if they do and they want more i can just fill them up and that's exactly what i told the police department if you want more once you're done with this send the thing home with jessie i will fill it up again and send it back and these ladies always send me back their tubs because they know i refill them so i will get these back eventually but if i don't it's not a big deal these these containers are not expensive but this is one way that i'm sharing my hot cocoa and if you give me one second i'll be back and show you another way that i'm sharing it and this way um i was gifted these bags that someone had purchased for a candy buffet they had set up at a wedding so i was purchased these but i'm sure you could get something like them at clearbags.com and i will try to link that for you in the description as well and i purchased from them in the past they are an awesome company i'll be right back in one second to share the next idea all right everyone this is my next idea for sharing this and my husband is actually going to take this one and give it to a lady that he works with in the office one there the one lady in the office there's only one and um so i just used it to fill it up with hot coffee and it's got the top like um like if you buy bags for coffee that's what it's like and it just folds down and rolls and then hooks in the back and i will share that with you but all i did was i cut out i used my cottage cuts dies and i cut out a circle here for the little image which says hot cocoa add two heaping teaspoons to one cup of hot water and then i did a scallop circle i'll zoom in a little tighter there and i did a scallop circle for the background and of course all of the papers again come from the knitwick collections and then i just added a little charm of a candy cane since he's hanging from a candy cane i thought that would be cute now i purchased this charm several years ago from dee who is elegant embellishments i don't know that she's going to carry them again or what she's even doing with her store because i know that she um has moved so i'm not sure if she's doing it i did find them on other places but you had to purchase them in a large quantity so if you know if you just google it in either aliexpress or wish or one of these places i'm sure they'll come up and they may have them in smaller quantities on aliexpress but the place i found had them in large quantities which was way more than i wanted and i can't even remember where i got them from or you know where i saw them at but i loved it i tied it on with a little bit of twine i poked a hole now this was my this was my boo-boo don't do this i poked a hole right here now of course you can still pour it out this side and you're fine or you roll it down and you get your spoonful that was a big boo because now there's a hole in the bag the smart thing to do would have been to use my crocodile and punch a hole in this plastic piece and then the plastic piece would be over here it would be out of the way and it wouldn't matter if there was a hole in the plastic piece but i punched it all the way through the roll on the bag so that was not one of my brighter moves definitely not one of my greater moves and uh but you know it will still work because you use a spoon you reach under the spoon get it out i don't think the hole is going to be a problem and the amount is below the hole so i mean it's not a super huge mistake but it's still one i'm not real thrilled with so i will probably change out the bag before i send it to um to my husband's co-worker and uh so that it you know doesn't look like it has a hole in the bag i'm just like i did it this morning my son asked me to get up and go to walmart at some crazy ridiculous hour to try to get some gaming system that they ended up not even having until tomorrow so i am like super tired and so punch drunk i'm just like i can't even think straight i think my eyes are rolling around i'm not even focusing but uh so that explains the hole in the bag if i had been thinking with my wits this morning when i did when i finished it up i would have punched the hole in the little me and the little flappy piece the plastic piece so do that don't punch a hole all the way through the bag and i'll be back in one second to share them with you again so in case you have any questions you can see them good again real good hold on one sec all right everyone here they are again again i punch this into a four inch circle that's what size it took to cover this lid but you know if you use you know you can use recyclable you know plastic containers with lids and just measure it and cut out your circle and adjust it to whatever size container that you're using but i will link these because they're great we my family uses the larger ones for leftovers and like i said the medium and the small ones we use to share i put food in for the elderly so i mean there's there there's a lot of great things you can use them for you could use them in your craft space because they're really handy things and they stack great so but i wanted to share those with you if you have any questions or comments leave them below i will try to link the um each of the collections as well from the nitwit collection so that you can go and purchase any if you're interested i know a lot of people love gingers and there's some really cute ones in this collection but this little santa with his wiry arms and legs for some reason cracks me up and mr and mrs claus came together but they also came separate in this set along with the sleigh being separate so these are all individual pieces that i lined up together and that is it this is the last way that i will probably i sent um hot cocoa and canisters that said coco on the front i found them at walmart i have a video that i will put up probably before this one and i went to the store today like i said i had to be there to try to get this crazy game for my son and um they were out of those red cocoa canisters already at my walmart but my walmart is teeny tiny doesn't get a lot of stuff so you guys still may be able to get them if you're interested in that one and i will link that video um and then just at the end of this one so that you can see it and that's it guys i will be back soon with some more videos if you like this video give it a thumbs up if you have any questions or comments leave them below and i'll do my best to answer them and remember to practice your cpr craft pray repeat thanks for visiting me today and happy crafting love you all bye", "5BLR-G98-8Q": "Hey everyone! This is Greg from Chemical Guys, and today I'm gonna show you exactly how to\ndilute your detailing products so you can get the best result on any job. There's two types of products: ready to use and concentrated. A lot of our products at Chemical Guys are\nconcentrated, and that means that they can be diluted. Now, what is dilution? Dilution is taking a product and mixing it\nwith water to water-down the product to get the right\nratio so that it works properly. It's a lot better for you as detailer and\nconsumer because we don't ship you water. We can ship you more product in a smaller bottle, and you can dilute it on the job. Dilution ratio is really complicated for some people, and a lot of people don't understand it. So we spent the time to make this awesome\ndilution ratio chart. This gives you all the dilution ratio measurements\nin ounces for any size container that we sell here at\nChemical Guys. We made one for 16 oz, 32 oz, 1 gallon, and\n5 gallon, and we gave you all the ounce dilution ratios\nfrom 1:1 to 128:1. This is a great tool to help you dilute products\nand make sure you have the right ratio to clean any type\nof job. Dilution ratio can be a little complicated,\nso I'll break it down and show you how it works. Dilution ratios are usually set up with two\nnumbers with a colon (:) in the middle. Those two numbers can be anything from 4:1\nor 64:1. This means that you're mixing, let's say at\n10:1, that's mixing 10 parts water to 1 part product. That bigger number is actually the water, and the smaller number is the amount of product that we're mixing in the bottle. Now every size bottle is different, so you\nneed to do the math to get the right dilution ratio for that size\nbottle. For example, let's dilute a 16 oz bottle 3:1. If you have 16 ounces, use that as the base\nto figure out the calculation. We take our ratio: 3:1, three parts water to one part concentrate, and we add those together. 3 + 1 = 4 Now we take the size of our container, 16 ounces, then divide it by the number that we added\nup together. So that's 16 divided by 4. 16 ounces divided by 4 is 4 ounces. Once we have that number, 4 ounces, that's the number for our \"one\" part. We take our bottle and fill it with 4 ounces\nof our cleaner or detailing product in the bottle. Now to get the ounces for the \"three\" parts, we take 16 ounces (the size of the bottle) and subtract our \"one\" part, which is 4 ounces. 16 - 4 = 12 That 12 ounces is the amount of water we use\nto get the right ratio. 12 + 4 = 16 and that fills up a full 16 ounce bottle. You can do this for any size container, like\na gallon, which is 128 ounces, or 5 gallons, which is 640 ounces. You can use this for any size container, but we set up our chart with the 4 bottle\nsizes that we sell at Chemical Guys. If math is a hard subject for you, you can easily use the chart by finding the\nnumber you want to place the dilution ratio at. So in a 16 oz. bottle at 8:1, you add 1.8 oz of product to 14.2 oz of water. It's super easy to do, and it makes diluting\nany product quick and easy. I'm gonna show you how to dilute the product\nin a bottle. We're gonna use a 3:1 ratio of AllClean in\nthis 16 oz bottle. Dilution ratios can be done in any type of\nratio. We give recommendations for specific product\ndilutions, So if you want to dilute your product 10:1,\nyou can easily do that. If you want to dilute it 4:1, you can do that\ntoo. You can even adjust your dilution ratio for\nthe job at hand. If I'm using AllClean here with a 10:1 or\n20:1 suggested dilution ratio, I can use it to clean something dirtier with\na dilution ratio of 3:1 for more cleaning power. I have an empty 16 oz. bottle here fitted\nwith the Perfect Pour EZ Fill Funnel. I'll screw the funnel on so I don't spill\nany product, and dilute it 3:1. So let's add the two ratio numbers: 3 + 1 = 4 so I'm gonna do this in quarters. I'll fill the bottle up a quarter of the way\nwith AllClean. That's about a quarter.. then I'll take my water--this is regular distilled\nwater, and dilute my product with the other three\nparts. This gives me a good ratio of 3:1. You notice I didn't spill any product because\nof my Perfect Pour Funnel, and I can fill it up right to the top for\nthe right dilution. Now our product is ready to go. I only have to add a sprayer, and then I'm ready to go detailing! Dilution ratios are super simple, and that's why we took the time to make this\nchart: so you can dilute any of your products in any sized bottle. You can make a full gallon, or a full five\ngallon pail, and use that ready-to-use solution whenever\nyou want. I'll put the link to this chart right in the\ndescription box in this video, and I'll put a clickable link right here on\nthe screen so you can print out the chart and put it in your garage, shop, or mobile\ndetailing van to have it ready to use whenever you need\nit. That way your dilution ratios area easily\ndone just by using this chart. We put a lot of time into making this chart\nhigh quality, so you can print a big version and place it\nin your shop along with our Detailing Flowhcart, and any other information that you can get\noff our YouTube channel and website to help you detail faster and\neasier. We hope you like the information! Check out our YouTube, Facebook, Instagram\nfor more information about Chemical Guys and the awesome educational\nfootage that we put on our YouTube channel.

gonna be on the final call from stick live and this is a premium flower guy so we're gonna see how premium it really is alright so for everybody that is in quarantine thanks for tuning thanks for watching the videos guys I know you guys are kind of bored at home probably with nothing much to do so I'm gonna try to get job guys as much content as I possibly can hey guys so with that being said let's get into the phosphate lung for fun finally a kid we go guards so this is the packaging okay which I like I love being able to see the flower mmm now this one has a nice strong smell I mean but it smells very very very sweet you spit this out here so y'all guys could get a good look at it okay so now the smell is building in the moon smells really first - so I had this full moon Wow and it still hasn't dried out I had it for about a month maybe I think ma'am guys so because these are one of my personal favorite companies when I are smoke I'm not on Canada gonna review for you guys this has been about my personal favorites I mean all the flowers are consistently good so you have to find out if this continues the trend cuz I haven't smoked this one and I gotta see I just opened up the better so let's get right on into it so as far as this flower here we've got that green but do we got that purplish color it's a it's an awesome smell only thing like I always say it could be turned a little better I like the size of the nose these are nice guys as you can see this one is one of the darker ones with lots of purple in it but it does smell great alright so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do tarragon some close up so y'all can see this for yourselves [Music] okay guys so y'all have a chance to view it just as I do right here in front of me so the flowers not that bad looking like I said I just wish to trim games a little better but I can't go play the bar you're gonna test out the quality so let's get some of this gonna run some of this up and once again this is the frosted line from fern Valley oh hey moisture level seems to be on point where as that is not dry and it's not too damp so the moisture level is great no seeds were in this batch here so that's a flux and I just got to let you guys know guys I'm doing put the information on the bottom video check out the price for these viii it's unbelievably does I need to go check out prices head to the website check out the prices cuz they do a really well with the pricing guys alright that's another reason why maybe you know listen man I like to I like to order from those guys when I'm not shooting telling me man save me some money so here we go guys gonna load up the glass pray [Music] that's nice giggles Oh change guys lost in love yeah so it had a sweet floral smell to the flower and when you light it in you're smoking it has a fresh citrus citrus taste to [Music] the smoke is a heavy at all this nice and smooth anybody that likes that a really small smoke this way is good really small as you can see it's no dark dank oh no but I'm getting tons of flavor it's tasty bats it really is a tasty smoke [Music] oh yeah but what I like about it the effects is almost meaning like those three poles that are took off the fight I'm already feeling it right spot Carmelo my body started to warm up just a little bit [Music] yeah yeah very very smooth that's very smooth I like this mm-hmm nice and tasty with the smoothness to it but it still hits so I like that a lot guys so good job to my peoples all that are valid forms as flowers definitely one in the top down I have to remove that Chardonnay and I have to remove the Chardonnay have to remove the Chardonnay from our second best because this one is like a complete balance a laptop a CD stood still my top choice got a CBC name delicious guys delicious step frosted lovin is just under has a nice amount of CDP in it so that guys that you know so for France I mean suffer from whatever it is you suffer from whatever right and of course is in the desert when 3% easy threshold that means legal that's wise alright so CBD smoke knock this signing out right now so I'll see you guys soon peace you [Music] [Music]", "VIXrPb3zpxM": "mixing the

hardener I win part reducer and I'm going to put it through a filter it keeps keeps the paint from sloshing around when I put it in the cup mixing Cup okay yes all the painted requires now for the hardener now for the reducer the reducers thins the paint makes it easy to come out of the spray gun all right so that's the paint ratio make sure the paint before you spray it while very important you're going to really do your work on the bench here and get this paint mixed all together up these three components or it's just not going to spray right", "csH10VkBfxc": "everybody ran here in East garage thanks for joining us for another live video on facebook and youtube today we're going to go over mixture ratios were going to explain them i'm going to show you how you can get an exact and precise ratio using mixing cups it may sound simple but it is it should be but we're going to show you exactly how to use them and why you need them plus the report lids gonna show you a couple paint guns and masking station and we're going to explain why this truck is sitting behind me now as always if you have any questions don't be afraid to post them in the comment and in the comment section on facebook and youtube Scotty seized over here you can see them nice shirt Scott yes stand up for your fans I don't get a good luck let them breathe in and so if you have any questions or comments all you gotta do is post them Scott's gonna dance answer him if it's something i can answer here or demonstrate I'll take care of it so first thing if you're mixing paint that probably means gonna be pouring paint out of a gallon like this now we've all done it and what happened Jennifer with the paint all around the lip you end up with a mess everywhere well you might want to go to eastwood and check out these port lids jewelry in here on it good alright so real simple just take the lid push it down on it seals tight and now when you want to pour you a poor out of here to set it back down it's sealed backup you don't have any mess at all in fact we even have them for courts to so no matter what size can you're using are going to portland for that's something that makes it makes a really nice when you're mixing paint so speaking of mixing paint let's get into mix ratio this jump right into it so i'm using this gallon jug because it's easy for demonstration purposes because it's going to be really easy to say we've got pints and quarts we got about all sizes you're going to need if you visit Eastwood we sell them kids and everything alive you're going to use in courts and we sell them as well so let's get right into it now these mixing cups are have about every ratio you want and we if we can get we're going to cut in here ok so there's a 211 three two one two one now that means say three to 11 which is what we're going to be using that simply means three parts paint one part activator one part reducer now if you're not using a reducer you can totally forget about this and you just use 2321 column and it and has four to 12 15 6 and 8 and around here is is just your standard measurements announces and milliliters to say want to mix 96 ounces and say you have one-to-one ratio you just pour up to 48 and then add your activator up here 296 now it's something beyond that you can use one of the charts i just showed you so job in june first I'll show you what we're gonna be mixing if we cut to jail here so what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be mixing it in eastwood single-stage everything which is a three-to-one ratio which is three parts paint one part activator now some people going to want to add a reducer so that's how you end up with your 3 2121 because you would add this also at one part so that's what we're going to do we're going to three parts paint one part activator and we're also going to reduce her to show you three two one to one ratio and now if we come back here to our to our large mixing Cup now say i decided i want to mix about 96 ounces so what I do is ok I take the 96 ounces right here and i would spin around the cup until I come to my 3211 right so 96 ounces puts me right there now you can see where that's at it's somewhere between this two in this three and my good here ok now somewhere between the two and three now remember these numbers here are not units of volume they're not units of measurement it just helps with the ratio so don't think yeah we're going to mix about 96 ounces we're not mixing exactly 96 ounces and these cups are just going to help with the ratio so we're mixing try not don't think that we're mixing you know like 30 ounces of this 1010 we're just going for about ninety six so we can mix a little more and use this and use this 3 or we can mix a little less and use this to now the 96 plus a little closer to the two so I'm going to mix a little less and use this to so what that means is the reason of all the way over here into this column is because i'm using three things so by the time I add the reducer I want to be over here so i would add the paint at the activator and the reducer so the final tally I want to be right about here which puts us at this too so the first thing I would do is I'm going to add i want to add the paint to the first two so this too is just the columns that we're going to use now all you to the first two then I'll add the activator which goes from there to there then we had the reducer from there to there so remember it's a 3 2121 so the first one is three parts and this ratio is just one-third of this ratio and this ratio again is just one-third 3 2121 if we want to mix more you would just use one of the other ones so we can get so now you may ask why you want to do this over just cups it's because it's very accurate or mixing stick a lot of times you use a mixing stick and what happens is is that the cups your bucket of your mixing in it may be tapered like this so if you're using a stick that has a measurements on it's based on a perfect cylinder so when you stick it in it it doesn't know it gets bigger so your ratio is going to be way off because cup grows it's not an accurate it's not actually won't be an accurate ratio anymore because the cups bigger and the sticks based on it being a perfect cylinder where these come in it's all that mass already done for you you're gonna get a perfect ratio every time because it's built into the bucket so the first thing we're going to do here if we cut back if we can come back to this close-up of the bucket is i'm going to add the peat up to the first two because again we're mixing three two one two one two you see I'm getting close so as you can see right here i'm in the three column and i'm using the tools because i want to end up here after i add all three parts the paint the activator and the reducer I want to end up there so my first one was three parts paint so I went to that too I'm gonna go to the next to with with the activator so now i'm going to have the activator up to that too so now you can see so now we have the now we have the paint and we have the activator so if that's all we needed if we were only using a three-to-one ratio if we if we only needed the paint and the activator we'd be done we can mix this up and we can go paint but because we also need a reducer we're going to go to right there so now we add the reducer and there we go we have a perfect three two one to one ratio of paint activator and reducer so before we get into a before we get into the paint guns and some other stuff around here Scott you have any questions or how we make it out here so far you've been explaining it really well you knocked it out of the park and thank you susan I've been practicing practices for about three weeks you can tell so help so I'm so anyways let's check let's check out the check out the paint guns um if you're looking for getting started to painting or if you're just looking for another gun spray some bass clear you want to check out this concourse LT a nice gun great price comes with 1.3 needle nozzle so it's good for spraying your bases and clears you cannot get other needle novels from eastwood if you want to spray your primers ah but over here checking out you get in here the coup de Gras the conch force pro two gun set really nice set I actually have this gun spray is really nice the kit comes with a regular gun and a detailed gun which is really nice to have hard-to-reach areas the detail cock gun comes with a one-point O'Neill nozzle and the concourse Pro comes with a 13 or 17 and a 20 so you're going to be all the spray everything from your primers all the way up to your base and clear codes so this kit is going to lie to pretty much spray everything you need on your car plus it comes with a regulator and it comes with your cups and right here in this box is cleaning kit and your gun wrench so if you're looking for your first your first HVLP pink onset this is a great set and if you're just looking to upgrade again it's a great set because it's got everything you need to spray from base to clear and primers so now that we got through that let's check out Oh check out i'm asking station so after already was set up i rise I should have I should have thrown a tip that you guys but I kind of ran out of time because we're scheduled to go live at three if you've never seen one of these masking trees masking stations the really nice we sell smaller version and if you're watching this live you might want to go to eastwood.com and check out our daily deal because every day we pick out a product we give you ten percent off and free shipping on a product so if you go to use with dot com take apart your daily schedule in the morning you don't check it out and see what products we have and I believe today we have a small masking station which holds one size paper it's like a store it's it's it's it's pretty nice and i think that might be our daily do today so if you're watching this live today only don't try calling in three weeks from now and telling our customer service department I told you get a great deal and then you gotta do it today but anyways well it works is it automatically puts on the tape so the masking tapes here the papers here so you pull out what you need and you rip it off and the reason i said i remember this was because a lot of times if i was going to paint the first thing i would do is i drip off a few feet of that and i would put it down here wherever i'm working so i put down one row of this one working because it's really nice to work on if you're mixing paint everything else because if you spill when you're done you just ball it up and you throw it away and it keeps your workstation nice and clean for the next time so one last thing all you people you probably want to know what this truck is behind me the truck behind me just arrived i believe its a 50 Chevy if somebody out there really knows their trucks and tells me to 51 I'm like believe you but the reason is here Andy whatever product engineers have seen them in some videos from our wedding videos he does gotta be brought in we push it into

concentrate take for one and then it goes one two one two three deucey so I've got these cups from my local paint supplier he uses these to mix up the aerosol cans small back stuff so we have the eight to one here how much of this I don't know I'm going to make how much I will say I might have to pause this because I can't get the lid off the here we go I can't get the lid off of the can Wow here we go stuff is very potent right do the eight pots want to do the blending clay first screwdriver screwdriver make sure you don't get anything uh dumping into your cup I'm gonna go we were through the top six pots that's the eighth one there you go and the cool thing about this that I really like is they come with these little legs and put the lid on and you can shake it up now I'm going to mix this one-to-one with a get the universal reducer when you get a mixing Cup out I have we're on top give me a second my stuff is still tacky watch it fall down leave my day under a normal makeup now one to one absolutely do something that song just work from the universal reduce a urethane medium take this this is one to one now essentially where is one to one we don't have one to one so we're gonna go on I'm gonna use the ounce Mobileye ounces that gave me well five ounces camera can see you say hi everybody so that's four and a half ounces so we're looking at about nine ounces there we go one two one and I'll even little more reducer in this Cup rinse it out and there it is you candy that's good to go now and then when I do my painting when I'm pulling out of the gallon I go when I go and get this cheap little but the little spot on the end of it thank you Justin and you guys know when you're pouring out of a gallon that makes a mess if you don't have the little trigger top so I use a ladle just ladle out put it in you can clean it up make sure it's a stainless steel you know save gel Sinjin in the long run don't waste as much paint you don't make as much of a mess so little tip that tip big tip alright guys so that's all mixed up I'll bring it back when I'll start to put base coat on this thing when we start using oh well one day", "Z028LAMIt8Y": "what's going on guys Kyle from fiberglass Florida and today we're gonna be breaking down our mixing cups we have some tabletop TT 8:02 over here some F 30 29 clear base a converter and a reducer we're only really gonna be messing with this today but we are gonna flip this cup around and this over here this tabletop is a two to one ratio so basically how this works is you kind of figure out where your end points gonna be with all the product in there and then you followed that number up to it so we're just using these first two columns today we're gonna want about that much product at the end of all this so we're going to pour the epoxy side up to the three and then pour the hardener up to the second three if we were dealing with this clear base over here the converted the reducer then we would be two to one to one so that would be let's keep it with a three so that'll be the finish line we'll start with that three for the clear base go up to there for the converter and then jump up to here with the reducer and then you would have a completed ratio but like I said we're gonna be mixing with a two-to-one TT 802 today so we can get pour in right now so right now we got the two parts of epoxy like I said up to the first three line and then we're gonna pour up to that second line we have two parts epoxy one part hardener so like I said earlier these lines don't these numbers don't signify any amount of ounces or anything it's just to keep it consistent following of the ratio so I like I said we went originally up to the first three boxing and then at the hardener it's pretty simple you just got to make sure you're following the right chart for the right mixing ratio it all mixed up alright so we got the epoxy the hardener and a little bit of Jamaica blue pigment give us some pizazz we got the epoxy the hardener shouldn't fill this odd shape and mold up just about the top then eventually it'll Harden and we'll have a nice shape it's pretty good all right we'll be able to show you the finished product after that all gets hardened so that is a wrap guys hope I simplified that at least a little bit for you but on that note hope you guys have a great day and we'll see you soon", "-w3QqE2HkcE": "hi guys today we're gonna make the truth or we can call it cream puff our ingredients today will be five ounce of milk half cup of water three eggs 1/2 cup of butter 1/2 cup plus tablespoon sifted flour all-purpose flour mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt so we're gonna need the saucepan we can add mix the water now and the butter we're gonna boil them and medium huh and we're gonna wait until got boiled after it got boiled we're gonna add the sifted flour with salt and sugar one time and then we gonna try to mix it with a wooden spoon and so we got a ball form okay guys no we have the boil milk water and butter so we're gonna add the sifted flour one time and keep mix them and so we have that for a ball form just keep and we can cook it like two more minutes almost there and I have the cake mixer ready I'm gonna use the puddle and then I'm gonna add the firm ball and the mixer and try to mix it for two minutes just to take off the heat now you can see the firm wall so I'm gonna love it here and then try to turn on the mixer using the puddle trying to take [Music] and mix it a little bit and so separate it again so you're gonna see does it looks like it's mix all together but when we gonna turn it on black for five minutes maybe less will begin cooperated now the batter is ready so I'm gonna scrape down all the batter and then we cannot talk about the pastry piping back so I have the pastry piping bag and I have the tip number 8 or 5 so I'm gonna cut like a small piece from the top and then insert the 805 tip like this I'm gonna squirt a little bit now we're gonna talk about because we need that fat factor to are the cream puffs to be all of them same size we don't wanna have small one and big one so what I have here I have I made a stencil and I have this round shape so I did here I hope you can see it so I have the sharpie and I did like a 3 x 5 circle like this and we don't want them all close to each other like this can you see the circles but the sharpie I'm gonna fur on the bottom because I don't want the Sharpie be on the job so so I'm gonna put a little bit here because I wanna stick it on the tray it's like a ghoul I'm gonna use it as I can because I don't want your paper so there is a certain way to use this one but please don't panic and what you're gonna do it's all about practice so what I'm gonna do just keep pushing the bottom and then swirled like this so now I have everything that's ready I have 15 piece of the cream puff and the oven is heated 350 and I'm gonna and serve the tray in the oven for 25 to 30 minutes John opened the oven during that 25 minutes so now so the cream puffs it has to kind of cream inside the following we're gonna make now the pastry cream the pastry cream ingredients is 2 cups of milk 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract correct cup of butter 2 whole eggs and two egg yolks and the dry ingredients is 4 tablespoon of corn starch mix with quarter cup of sugar and 1 1 quarter of teaspoon salt so in the beginning I'm gonna mix the eggs both of them so before I continue with this one I'm gonna pour the milk and vanilla and put them on medium please while I'm mixing the eggs medium heat okay mix the two whole eggs with two yolks and then add the dry ingredients keep mix after we have the milk and vanilla boiled I'm gonna temper that milk with the egg mixture [Music] now then well got boil I'm gonna temple and not a little bit with keep whisking because I want the hot milk affect the eggs keep a little bit milk and keep whisking okay so now I'm gonna return the whole mixture to the saucepan and put it back on the medium heat and keep whisking until I got a little bit stay back for 30 seconds and I will add the butter to it so now the mixture cut say so I'm gonna add butter to it and keep mix until the barakah after the burdock melt I'm gonna strain it Travis cream pastry cream to have a very smooth cream after I straining I'm gonna attack there directly the plastic wrap on top of it I'm gonna put directly on top of it touch it because we don't want to have any like a thick top on top of the screen like this so we're done from the basic cream I'm gonna prepare the other cream and then at the end I'm gonna mix them together and saw the cream puff okay so now we're gonna make a chocolate ganache to dip the cream puff on it so this is one cup of chocolate chip and one cup of heavy cream and I heat it with a medium heat and I'm pouring over the chocolate chip and leave it for two or three minutes and then we will whisk it so going back to the to the pastry cream we made but that was made from the egg and a ghost and then I told you the following Gates makes of two kind of cream this is the easy cream just like that 1 cup heavy cream mixed with one teaspoon of vanilla extract and choral cup of powdered sugar just keep whisk until you have this cream so what I'm gonna do now I'm gonna whisk this cream just to soft it and after I mix them I'm gonna use the pastry bag with a small tip to fill the cream puff so I'm going back to that chocolate chip and heavy cream so just keep mixing from the middle okay after I mix the two kind of cream to follow the cream puff I made the chocolate ganache from the chocolate chip and heavy whipping cream and puff pastry is ready out of the oven so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fill them out with the Queen so I put the cream on the pastry bag using this very tiny tip or you can use whatever you have at home so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna pull it so I have the chocolate ganache ready so I'm gonna it's just a little bit like this", "443n8Udr77k": "okay I'm going to try it two three five seven polyrhythm - with the left foot cowbell three with the right foot bass drum five with the side stick on snare left hand and seven with right hand on cymbals have you the cymbals up to people from washing everything out give a little clarity and I haven't perfected this yet so let's see how it goes [Music]", "bJ4Ta6GyGi0": "hey what's up yeah yeah I get a lot of questions accidents in my email and a DGP in closing I don't particularly about eight slim performance it's not a misconceptions out [Music] a lot of false information sometimes come from the battle facts for trying to profit off of him other type of some individuals who just play because they love a particular brand which is something wrong with it he'll I prefer for by the reason to sundown when it come to 80 and souls because of innovation they have but I'm not gonna say the D the best so every application I depends what you have vehicle no one you have supply that's good we have support that how to claim there's a space we have a bill so there is no perfect 80s no matter where you see me in the throes of the moment enjoy by sundown the exits I'm not gonna say as a vegetable for all applications I will say for most it was suffice and be more than adequate but those factors space available space available for the enclosure power you want supply the vehicle as well as price what you all as me and in cardio what you were willing to spend for the most part you get what you pay for the all exceptions to the rule except there's a severance is nothing ever black and white Ashton stone they always gonna be seems to rule so what one of the misconceptions I'm gonna tell you on this video right here is don't for a moment let anyone tell you with a traditional eighty and self-love basket and motor they regardless of what the motor is but a traditional 8-inch basket which is 8.75 in diameter out of which issues about everybody's sundown since I was called Mesoamerican base I'll die with 875 traditional 80 this was considered traditionally you're gonna have a six and a half inch spider no 675 maybe 717 spider underneath kind of what basket she cable six four six and three-quarters 170 spider on that blended whether you have one or two spiders or even three the only gonna get so much usable throw and that's gonna be someone between 23 to 11 millimeters and the low endless special bad throw is based on the strength of the motor and the design with his Ola Han under home at the top being inspected 23 maybe 24 millimeters Leaney the race is gonna be mechanical which may or may not registered on the meter if that's what you have but for sure it's not going the X X mechanical is not gonna sound this pier is the x max linear that's your cleaning sound that's your cleaners output and most manufacturers tell you the rms that you need to reach linear x max anything any power you throw after that it's just wasted that's fact any power you throw after that is just gonna be turning the heat for the most part when manufacturers underrate they subs they're not underrating about twice the rated power so if their wool forget to take a thousand watts daily they're not going to list it at 500 they might list it at 800 Armas knowing that they can go to a thousand but they're not gonna listen it half that donating so what I'm saying a 500 watt subwoofer is not gonna take 100 watts RMS consistently they and eight ain't day in day out when they give you your arm it's raining they're saying that that subwoofer can take that rms rating for 8 hours at a time 6 to 8 hours continuously and will not destroy or damage any of the soft parts order our basket I'm gonna give you two examples sundown x8v three-arm is reading is 800 you were reached your linear max x max in 800 anything more than to apply you're going into X mechanical which can't introduce distortion into your output hard to hear with a subwoofer but it's there if you take 800 are miss and I know I know personally it can take your body 1,000 1,100 about 3 that's it's underrated about 300 linearly it's still going sound good even though it's reaches leave your x max it's not so far to the mechanical there's not it's not gonna sound good any more powder you put to that 8 inch above 1100 it's just going to turn the heat and now you're gonna start destroying this up itself point to example two massive hippo eighty-four whether you got egg sale all you got to 84 the original and there's a lot of surface to use that design in motive in the massive hippo 884 and the masses people exhale 84 500 watts rating for the massive hippo 84 and I love that late dad I lose that is a greedy I wish I didn't have my Facebook account of what had videos all these eighths I was tested just now having a free time to get back into that matters hippo eight crates up 500 watts RMS 1000 watts max not 1000 watts RMS 1000 watts max which means it can take that for I don't know dynamic burst something of that nature maybe a little bit more maybe you know in music you have forgot what they called a piece of music so some time to serve off have you got irradiated 500 watt sometimes I get any signal basically when you have a turn in when your dials it and what you have to produce it might get a dynamic boosts up for I'm talking about milliseconds talk to your wife 4200 watch it'll take that before that split second but it won't take his continuously that matters people 584 was fine when one arm is I know it could take by 700 maybe 750 all day every day for sure ain't gonna take 500 like the sundown x8 v3 for sure here take 800 for hours at a time no problem when you start putting more power to itself you start increasing the chance of the cell filling the glue on the form the glue that's on the magnets the stack maintenance itself that heat heat is the enemy he doesn t mean amplifiers he is enemy and uh subwoofers speakers heat and electricity do not go together something's going to fail so I pretty much operate my system and it's just my hair at one time I'm him the whole XE o XE sundown xav once man I was I had this videos and people nobody know me know my name remember I used to have a prime 1208 100 each x8 v1 it's rated 750 there dose didn't know drop football game puts out and it was a promise example but it puts out way more than 1200 he'll they said the promises 750 puts out 1100 but the I had a prime to everyone's on one on each eight and yes I had that sense power set up I didn't have a high-power alternator time but I did have I had three batters in that truck I got four on this one I had to one of these big fake and I wasn't just throwing a lot of power power power yeah 2400 watts of two weeks I know now that no I did nothing was not counting box rise but also it's not designed having that much power all I was doing is generating heat I never told him up I was at never tore him up but knowing what I know now I think my 2x8 VIII's on this BDCP it's 16 on you watch with the stepped up alternating batteries for excess power bands yeah well three exes Powerbars I have and a group 35 factory ain't a GM up front cuz I have a DS application I think this is louder than the 2400 watch that I had that I thought I had on the hav ones so I'm just putting all this perspective there's nothing wrong with setting the subwoofer just it's rare on this get you a properly designed enclosure and make sure you getting true power by having a good electrical to support your amplifier and you'll be amazed and what any subwoofer but particularly these 8 inches can do misstating Shopaholic", "bP4S6bbdSXU": "[Music] hello everyone my name is

going to suck but at least i'm doing it make a big noise playing in the street gonna be a big man someday you got mud on your face your big disgrace kicking your cat all over the place nailed it and by that of course i mean i got a nail through my hand and it hurts please help oh by the way roomie did you really think you could challenge me in a video and then rip up my grandpa's precious tissues without consequence did you think i would just i don't know improve on your best impressions and then not challenge you in return no have you ever done character impressions [Music] pretty sure you never have time to play on my home field still subscribed precious oh yeah i'm coming for you thanks for watching if you like this video please feel free to check out some of my other stuff i do singing impressions and character impressions also if you're not familiar with the guy i'm destroying in this video check out roomieofficial he uploads a lot more frequently than i do and his videos are pretty cool maybe i guess if you're into that sort of thing i'd like to give a massive pretentious singing shout out to my patrons on patreon thank you oh that was terrible thank you so much for supporting me on my noble quest to kicketh roomie's butt and i'd like to thank you guys once again very much for watching please like the video if you liked it or dislike if you disliked it subscribe for more music and videos and turn on notifications if you love me as much as i love you and i'll see you guys later all right done boom oh look merch", "w5veSvL_wgo": "hey guys Jake from pros go here we get a lot of questions coming in to customer care about what is a part they're looking at our data sheets and they see a mix this product at one part product to three parts water and they say well how much is a part well we're going to talk a little about that today and show that it doesn't matter what size container you're working with or how much material you're working with as long as each part is equivalent to the others my first things first always make sure you get your proper PPE on when mixing product if we're mixing this product say at a one-part cleaner to three part water dilution ratio I'm gonna take one part of cleaner and I'm gonna take three parts of water always add the water to the bucket first and then add the cleaner so in this case I would take three of these buckets pour those in and then add my equal one part of cleaner to the bucket after that it doesn't matter if we're talking individual gallons if we're talking fives if we're talking pints even a cap full I've got one part to four parts dilution ratio and I just want to make a little tiny bit up I can take one part of the cleaner and mix it with four equal parts of water and I've got my proper ratio so again a part is a part is a part it doesn't matter if it's a gallon a cap full of five a drum whatever it may be long as each of the parts are equal for more information contact us at one eight hundred two five five four two five five find us online at pro SoCo calm and remember when you're working with prosecco products it's always you a project [Music]", "LKxGhukePfs": "in this video we're going to take a look at ratios with applications from cosmetology the process of mixing hair color and developer typically requires a one to one one to one and a half or a one to two ratio of color to developer hair color requires multiple steps including the application of a mixture that includes the color and a product that allows the color to change the color of the hair which is known as the developer or oxidizer different products require different mixing ratios the most common ratio is equal parts of hair color to developer which means we're using a 1 to 1 ratio for example if two ounces of color or pigment is used to dye hair then an equal a part of developer which would mean in this case two ounces of developer is needed this two ounces of pigment or hair color to two ounces of developer expressed as a fraction would be two over two if we divide top and bottom by two or reduce this fraction it reduces to one to one and expressed as a ratio it's indicated here with the colon in between the two numbers if more hair color is needed say for a long head of hair and we're using a one to one ratio how much developers needed if six ounces of hair color is used well since it's a one to one it would be an equal amount of developer which in this example would require six ounces of developer to the six ounces of hair color expressing this example as a fraction we would end up with six over six which reduces to 1 over one and the equivalent ratio one to one sometimes such as in high lift applications a higher ratio of developer to color is used this means you may see ratios of one to one and a half or one to two color to developer there are brands which require one to two which means one part hair color to two hearts developer the one to two ratio is often seen in hide lift hair lightening products let's look at an example of a product that contains 1.4 ounces of color and has a mixed ratio of one to two this means you will need double or two times the amount of developer as that of the color and here's why if we take the ratio one to two and express it as a fraction one over two that fraction when set equal to an equivalent fraction where we already know what the numerator of the second fraction is going to be the amount of color in this particular product one point four ounces we would need twice as much as the numerator for the amount of developer so we're going to take two times one point four which results in a two point eight ounces of developer looking at the one to one-and-a-half ratio if you were to mix one part water to one point five parts drink mix you would say that it was in a ratio of one to one and a half that means if you add one ounce of water you would need one point five ounces of drink mix what if we double the amount of water how much drink mix is needed to maintain the one to one and a half ratio well if we double the amount of water to two ounces we need three ounces of drink mix why 3 ounces of drink mix with the two ounces of water let's take a look at what's going on first we're going to express the ratio one to one-and-a-half as a fraction next we will set that fraction equal to the original example of one ounce water 21.5 ounce drink mix all we've replaced essentially as the ounces water and ounces drink mix we still have a 1 to 1 and a half and then we're going to set it equal to an equivalent fraction that is a double set amount to maintain equality in fractions to get an equivalent fraction we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same value so we are doubling the amount of water for an equivalent fraction multiplying the numerator by 2 likewise we need to multiply the denominator by 2 multiplying 2 times 1.5 gives us three ounces of drink mix and there's where we can see where the three ounces of drink mix is coming from when we double the amount of water what if we choose to use three ounces of water how much drink mix is needed with the one to one and a half ratio again if we set up equivalent fractions that need the denominator using the strategy of multiplying the numerator by three for the equivalent fraction we also would need to multiply the denominator by three meaning we are going to multiply 3 times 1.5 to give us a 4.5 ounces of drink mix to ensure we have maintained the ratio of 1 to 1 and 1/2 there is another way that we can solve for the missing denominator value and is to take half again as much of the numerator to determine the denominator in other words if we take half of three and we can get that one of two ways we can take 3 divided by 2 which gives us 1 point 5 or 3 times 1/2 that's half of 3 it gives us 1 point 5 and we add this half to our original numerator value we would have 3 plus the half of 3 1.5 which results in 4.5 taking this one step further what if we want 6 ounces of water how much drink mix is needed we can solve this using the proportion method what did we do to the numerator for an equivalent fraction it was multiplied by 6 likewise the denominator needs to be multiplied by 6 shown here 6 times 1.5 our ratio ends up with 9 ounces of drink mix otherwise we can use the second method just shown in the last slide add half of the numerator - the numerator to find the denominator so 1/2 of 6 is 3 added to 6 for the 1 and 1/2 there's our one part plus 1/2 part gives us the 9 ounces of drink mix required when having 6 ounces of water let's turn now to hair color examples where in this first slide the hair color being used needs to be mixed with the developer on a one to one-and-a-half ratio if you use 30 milliliters of color what amount a developer will be needed for the solution we can set up a proportion to solve for the missing of developer and using the strategy of equivalent fractions one times what gives us 30 it is 30 so likewise we multiply the denominator by 30 30 times 1.5 results in 45 milliliters of developer or the second method of having the numerator half of 30 is 15 that's our half added to the whole part which is 30 in this example 30 plus half results in the 45 milliliters of developer with the 30 millimetres of color to maintain the one to one and a half in this next example one part permanent hair color with one and a half parts developer is the ratio for this particular product what if 100 milliliters of the hair color is needed how much developers required setting up the proportion we would have our ratio of one to one and a half given we're using 100 milliliters of color we will multiply the numerator by 100 and likewise we'll multiply our denominator in our ratio by 100 100 times 1.5 results in 150 milliliters of developer or if you prefer the having method half of the numerator half of 100 100 divided by 2 is 50 added to the numerator for the one whole part plus the half results in 150 milliliters of developer with the given 100 milliliters of hair color in this last example we're given if a half ounce of color is needed how much developers required for the correct one to one and a half ratio using the proportion method we have our one to one and a half ratio set equal to our known amount of color over unknown amount of developer what did we do to the numerator for an equivalent fraction it's multiplied by 1/4 so likewise we would multiply the denominator by 1/4 1/4 times 1 and 1/2 if you prefer the equivalent of 1/4 is 0.25 it's decimal equivalent see and multiplying the ratio in the denominator of 1.5 results in 0.375 ounces or if you stayed fraction wise or an equivalent you'd have 3/8 ounce of developer using the second method where we take half of the numerator 1/2 of 1/4 to multiply fractions you multiply numerators 1 times 1 is 1 multiply denominators 2 times 4 is 8 gives us our 1/2 but then we need to add that to our whole part which is 1/4 1/4 plus our 1/8 half of that to add fractions together we have to have common denominator now we could convert these into decimals if we want but 1/4 can easily be converted to 8 by multiplying top and bottom by 2 2 times 1 is 2 2 times 4 is 8 so there's our 1/8 only now as an equivalent to 8 added to that 1/2 so we have our 1 and 1/2 method results in add your numerators 2 plus 1 is 3 over the common denominator of 8 there's our 3/8 of developer or again the decimal equivalency if you take the numerator 3 and divided by 8 you have point 3 7 5 ounces you you", "rEXifo3mqYE": "hi my name is Evan English from Old English Outfitters today we're going to talk about how to read and understand all the numbers on the end of a shotshell box [Music] from the time I was about ten years old I was spending time in the field with my father I was also spending time in the store here learning about safety about the about the technical aspects of firearms so I kind of grew up in the field grew up in the store at the same time one of the things we love to do together was shoot shotguns whether it was out in the field hunting birds hunting game over our dogs or whether it was clay bird sports where we were shooting skeet or trap or sporting clays so as we did that I had to learn what the right things were and try to choose the right ammo for the tasks that we were about to do those numbers are important that we're about to decipher one to choose the safe load for your shotgun to make sure that you're doing the right thing based on the tolerances of your shotgun and the second is task-oriented we want to make sure that we're choosing the right shell to match the tasks that we're about to do whether it's a light target load for target sports or whether it's a heavier load for hunting game we're gonna make sure we're choosing the right amo for the task the first number we're gonna look at on any box of shot shells is going to be the gauge if you look at the gauge here this is a 12-gauge the most common gauges are ten gauge which would be bigger and then twenty 28 and 410 which should all be smaller easier to remember this that the larger the number the smaller the gauge the smaller the number the larger the gauge for the purposes of today we're going to talk about 12-gauge it is the most common gauge that we use here in the United States and chances are that most of you are using a 12-gauge at some point in time or another 12-gauge eni's this gauge needs to be matched up with your gun barrel somewhere on your gun barrel it should state what gauge your shotgun is if it's 12-gauge if it's a 16 gauge if it's a 20 gauge if any of these gauges you need to make sure it matches up with this gauge the second number that you'll see on the box is the length of the shell this is the length of the shell after it has been fired so as you're looking here at two and three-quarter inches if I were to pull one of these shells out that's part of this box of ammo two and three-quarter inches would be the measurement after this shell has been fired if you were to measure it empty comparatively the longest 12-gauge shot shell would be three and a half inches after its fired these are both the same gauge but very different chamber lengths you want to make sure that this matches up to your shotgun if your shotgun has a maximum chamber length of three inches then you can shoot up to a three inch shell in your shotgun you don't want to shoot bigger than that if your chamber length is two and three-quarter inches then this is the maximum length shell that you can shoot in your shotgun safely some people have argued that I can put a three-inch in my two and three-quarter inch chamber and that is true it will fit in there but when you fire it it will open into the forcing cone and cause extra pressure so make sure you match that number up the third number that you see here is the velocity the velocity that's on this particular box of shells is 1220 feet per second so that's gonna give you some idea of how fast that it is moving how fast it's moving its payload which would be the shot charge this is the next number but the velocity also gives you an indicator of of its overall power of the shell on some boxes you'll find a dram equivalent on this particular box of target loads you'll see a velocity here but then on this you'll see the DRAM equivalent DRAM equivalent is a kind of a throwback to the age of black powder a dram was one sixteenth of an ounce of black powder and it gave you an indicator when you looked at a dram equivalent to the amount of power or energy that that show was storing up we see it more directly related to the velocity these days than we do the overall power but it is a function of both of these numbers so that dream equivalent will help you a little bit but it does not tell you the whole story the velocity may tell you the next number that you find on this box is the payload or the shot charge the amount of shot that is in the shot shell these particular ones are one and a quarter ounces this target load that you see here is announced in an eight and if you were to take a magnum load in a three and a half inch turkey load you'll see that that is two ounces so comparing these three numbers ounce and a quarter ounce in an eighth this is about 10 percent 10 to 15 percent less however this is a much longer shell and it's a whole lot more almost double the target load another 30 percent 33 percent more than a standard field love these are important numbers the higher the higher the shot charge the more recoil on the backside where you're standing and also the higher the shot charge depending on what shot size you're using but also means more pellets going out the end of the barrel there's a good balance that has to be found here on shot charge because you want to make sure that you've got enough shot charge to do the job not too little not too much you don't want to endure a bunch of recoil this particular load would not be that fun if you were shooting 75 to 100 rounds in the Dubb field one day or shooting at clay Birds whereas a lighter shot charge might be much better for for us the way you don't need a lot of energy or a lot of shot and you want to be able to shoot a lot of shots without enduring a bruised shoulder the last number that you'll see here on the box is the shot size shot size is important because it tells you the size and somewhat the weight of the shot that you're shooting as we look at the shot size this one is they've given us icons that this is for hunting it's showing the pheasant a squirrel a rabbit so we know that this is a they've given us every indicator that this is a hunting load but many people don't know what those are as I'm looking at the this particular display I can see that it's showing me some some shot sizes going from trip alot buckshot all the way around to be be at the six o'clock position here and then wrapping back around up to the number nine shot back up here at almost 12 o'clock showing me the smallest shot most of your target loads are gonna be in this seven and a half eight nine shot most of your hunting loads for lead shot are gonna be in this 6 5 4 5 being a great balance between sixes which just got a little more shot and fours which gives you better penetration so that's kind of a ideal balance you'll see most hunting loads in this range twos fours bb's those you don't see a lot of those anymore because of changes in waterfowl hunting but these used to be very big for waterfowl hunting probably 20 years ago so if you look at these here you'll see that those are bigger these buckshot loads you'll find those used in defense loads or for something to reach out very far you won't find a lot of these in a shell so for instance a double-aught buck you might find nine pellets in a 12-gauge shell and those are what you would find in a say a defense loved this trip a lot double out there and the the 30 32 caliber range and and then these are much smaller diameter loads so coming back to reading the box where we started we've got the shot size and it's going to be based on what you're trying to accomplish with that shot shell will determine the shot size that you choose so in review coming back we've got the gage make sure that this matches up with your shotgun the chamber length also make sure that this matches up with your shotgun these are really important for safety you don't want to put a 20 gauge in a 12-gauge 12-gauge chamber it might go off it could cause a very unsafe situation the chamber lengths again make sure that the two and three-quarter inch will work in a three inch but not vice versa make sure that you're shooting the right length shell that is your gun is suited for it choosing the right power is important you want to make sure that you choose the right velocity the right power shell to go with your go with your task that you're trying to accomplish so this is a very task-oriented number also the shot charge making sure that you've got enough pellets going out the end some people like to get more velocity and less shot charge so these kind of bounce one another here and then the last number the shot size this won't make a difference for any of these others this only has to do with your intended use and that's how you choose the shot size one of the last things I want to dispel before we before we stop is the whole idea of high brass low brass the reason for high brass on a shot shell has to do with back in the days where shot shells were made out of paper and they had to have a higher brass on them in a higher power shell to make sure that the black powder didn't burn through the paper causing the shell to separate inside the gun today we do it still put the higher brass or the higher collar on the [ __ ] on higher power shells as a visual indicator and as a helpful note for those choosing the loads lower power would be lower brass or lower collar again not necessarily limit burn throughs but still important as a visual indicator and helpful to let you know which one to choose for what tasks well that's about it for today I want to thank you for joining us and for watching this video if you like what you saw

When working with a paint system like Matthews,\nit's imperative that you actually mix it correctly. To make this an easier process for any of\nour fabricators, we'll use Matthews mixing cups. The benefits of using a Matthews mixing cup\nis that it's already pre-measured out for the specific products that we offer\navailable to any fabricator. As you can see, they're pre-measured on the\nsides for specific products and you can use these measurements when mixing up the paint\nbecause getting the proper ratios of the products correctly is imperative to making the paint\nnot only dry correctly but also cure correctly. This is a standard product offering from Matthews. It's a particular color mixed up for this\ndemonstration. We're actually going to open up the can and then we will put the proper amount of\npaint into the mixing cup to a specific ratio because the important part of Matthews\nis to make sure that we mix it 3:1:1 That's three parts paint to one part catalyst\nto one part reducer. Ronnie has predetermined at which mixing ratio\nhe wants to use of 3:1:1 so in order to measure exactly the proper ratio\nbetween paint, catalyst and reducer. This would be a standard mixing ratio for\nthis specific product for this specific application, no matter whether it's Nova photopolymers\nyou're painting or any other substrate. As you can see, Ronnie has filled it up to the level 3\non that particular mixing line of 3:1:1 The next is the catalyst. What Ronnie's going to do now is pour in\nthe catalyst at the proper mixing ratio. As I described earlier, Matthews is mix three parts\npaint to one part catalyst to one part reducer. It's the cross-linking of the catalyst\nto the paint resin system that actually forces the paint\nto not only dry but cure. Ronnie will now grab the reducer,\nwhich is going to thin down the viscosity and actually help control the\npaint's ability to flow over the substrate when we go into the\npaint booth and spray. Again, this part of the mixing ratio is 3:1:1 so this is the last part of one to get three parts \npaint, one part catalyst, one part reducer. Now that we have our paint\nmixing ratio at 3:1:1, Ronnie can just get a stir stick and now stir\nup the paint for about 30 seconds to 60 seconds to make sure that all of the\nproducts are mixed correctly.", "qkkZVs9neCI": "hi there it's shel and clint is outside guess what he's doing yeah he's cutting wood so he's probably tired every time he comes in i'm like what happened what uh he's fine i told you to please use extreme caution but such a beautiful day today i haven't even just wanted to sit around take a nap or anything like that it's kind of like spring i really want to play you know in the weather so but and i guess the gas guy just called it was either when i made a trip outside or um earlier i'm not sure when but um showed like an hour ago so and he said i'll be up there in about an hour so he should be here anytime so guys we are going to work on this until i am distracted uh clinton just say hi and to tell you guys he's being careful i think he's getting tired of me saying what happened what happened okay of course i didn't get all my stuff i'll be right back so i went outside and grabbed my um stencil i felt well i'll use this one got back in the house realized i needed something else from out there so i yeah so some people use stencils to cover up white pages if you don't like them and you know i try to do double-sided papers now but of course sometimes we don't get them but like this one we have that on the other side i love that i think that turned out so cool so i am i need to mail this this is going to somebody i just haven't got it in the mail yet she doesn't mind though it's a gift a gift unless i get a prettier one yeah so the guy's here right now that's so funny yeah so the guys here did i already say that i don't know making sure i was thinking oh i'm gonna go tell clint because he's outside the bark and stuff which isn't as dangerous as using me maybe he'll take some cats i'm kidding so he's gonna don't know if i should go out about it you think that's got this right he'll call me if he needs me it's funny our answer machine doesn't have our time on it you know and uh it's like saturday but it was today i don't know how to set it but our phone had the time on it okay see i don't want a lot on here because i still want you to be able to draw right on it whatever and you know what is that dry i don't want it smearing like on this other page so it's distress oxide if you guys are familiar with that i am let me just grab a piece of blank paper put it here it kind of feels wet still but it's because of the ink it is it does take a little bit longer to dry so just decorating a little bit i do want to pull out my um what was i saying i don't know but i do want to get all these decorated you know i know what i was saying something but my brain this is the distress oxide this one is wilted violet i really like that distress oxides i think they're really pretty that's not not a fan i don't have much much luck with this i should have brought those little brushes in leslie i think she sent them to me they're easier to use with stencils because you just kind of there we go that's cute let me see what paper if it's going to be like on coffee dye paper i don't think i need to put anything on it okay and then this one this one will be kind of fun i'll just kind of go like over the center hey hello use my fingers you could use your fingers couldn't shut what a mess wants to show the guy let me show you what we're doing i kind of like the idea of it kind of coming through one side he's like oh well how are you guys hurting have people to talk to you know sometimes when we're on locates these little old people they will sit and talk your ear off and we always sit and talk to them because you know we know they're lonely so this guy's probably talking to clint because he's like oh man this guy's lonely let me show you what i'm doing man that's too funny i don't know what he's talking about now that guy's loud i can hear him in here hundreds and hundreds i hope he's not talking about dollars for our gas hey i made it work guys of course my hand's all goopy of course did he hurry up and bring it back in no okay i think we got all that one though i should pause it shouldn't i yeah what's the point what is that one let's see this one yeah there's a little bit of i'm gonna go get that from him i'll be right back okay guys so i got my thing back and he the guy was leaving so i just stood at the door and he said that what we should do is just get the small get some more small ones that we have and just fill those up for backups because it would cost hundreds of dollars i already had this one didn't i and because they're gonna have to pipe it and all this stuff so he said it's just not worth it so everybody came out to see it because the other guy was like i don't know come back in a while so next time we go over to durango and that'll save us some money because i think they're only like 40 bucks each i told plant we should get three of them and that way when we're on our third one take the other two in to get filled you know i mean i'm not gonna need a lot though when i went out earlier it's still really cold out there so you'd need it just to take the chill off there so yeah that's what the dalio is so when we go over take this one and then maybe we'll buy a couple when we go to somewhere that they have them you know hi gracie yeah i had to wash my hand and look at it it's still purple but yeah he was talking about the about hundreds of really hundreds and hundreds gracie you're gonna get purple all over your cute little fur oh here's a baby girl there's a baby girl there's baby gracie mom she's really petite kind of like sugar was yes she was and she get kisses i'm on the nose i'm gonna go away okay go away honey there you go pull up there okay so yeah that is where we stand and i mean the guy came all the way from cortez but it was really nice because poor thing though that's an hour round trip you know that's okay though i'm sure he doesn't mind and to plant you know it's a blessing that he came out because then we're not spending all this time waiting till may or whatever to get a um heater out there when it kind of defeats the purpose i really want to get out there so yeah may have like 100 gallon tanks at um home depot but they're as tall as i am and then i was gonna wonder if he could film you know but he says then you have to lug it off all the way down to the store and i said just get smaller ones so now we know that's kind of cute i wanted something a little bit different my hands are so pretty and purple so purple okay oh i love that don't you guys just love that one so fun yeah chris just out there debarking right now he's using his carving i think a carving knife but i did get him a new carving glove because he had cut his so it's not here yet though there we go those are kind of cute is that it nope i have one more let's see nope that's it cool didn't take long for something big and pretty so now i am going to go wash my hands so i don't get ink everywhere that i don't want it okay guys so you know what okay sorry i checked to see if um yesterday's video is done uploading but when my computer shuts down it pauses the video from uploading so in that case you guys would not have seen my question about whether or not you want to see me gluing this in or sewing these in so i'm just going to sew them in uh clamp sewed around the edges and we're going to put these guys in here i think i want that one first it doesn't really matter to me okay just to show you guys uh we ordered i ordered some more of this thick it's supposed to be thick fabric the um interfacing if you guys find any thick then let me know i ordered it this time off of overstock.com so now i got to figure out a way to get my money back because it's not what i'm looking for so and i already have too much of other stuff that i wasn't what i wasn't looking for so i am going to put six inches here and then we are going to just fold it over but this is one of the really thick ones that clint had and the people i ordered it from it's no longer selling it and this one is really thin so i don't know why they're calling it heavy weight because it's so it's not heavyweight so i'm kind of bummed we may have to find another way to to do that you know and then clint just makes these six by i mean eight and a half no nine nine or nine and a half by fourteen and then i come in at six inches so like mom has written and said if she does one over 14 would that work you know yes mom it would work just makes a bigger spine which isn't a bad thing so i think she's working on something so today we will be at the doctor's office checking clint's finger he did kind of look at it and he was kind of concerned it might be clint did when we were cleaning it it might be uh infected but we think it might have been the petroleum jelly that they put on they put like a piece of fabric on it that's covered in petroleum jelly so that his uh doesn't stick to the to the tear okay so and then that is look how full it already is usually mine you know you can touch this the side because of my papers because when i first started this i was putting way too many papers in it and i think i'm gonna have to either glue this or burn it i don't know if it will burn but we're gonna try gracie's riled up okay so i am going to fell out of my book okay but you know i'm glad that that guy came because he knows more than we do and which one could have already done that if we were thinking okay you know what i'm going to show you guys today i'm going to show you how to make a template so because i usually have those on hand so i never really make one so i'm just gonna use this we'll see see if it's the size you made it to be approximately the size of your i know honey size of your spine so this one i'll measure it and see let me trim this real quick i know i'm using that paper and i'll probably wish i hadn't but so that's about right okay so i'm thinking you know i haven't shown you guys how to make one from scratch so one and a half and he made it 14 so 12 it should be two inches i don't know why it's not but it's not quite the yeah it's just one and a half gracie please honey i know honey show grandma your belly grandma see grace's belly maybe clint's getting tired and he'll want her okay you gotta go play honey i know look at her she totally she's gonna say innocent but she's not let go let go okay no oh graceland oh where this is gonna go in the center she's in my box now so yes we are moving out there we're gonna go get those as soon as we have time it might be next week though because i don't think anywhere near here sells them so okay so you have your piece you have your spine i did check that didn't i it's not quite yeah it is too but if it's not perfect like this size i just kind of you know put it in the center so that's fine so let me show you what i do do i have this i have this very simple but i was just thinking if i have shown you guys and i've made over 100 junk journals so that tells you how many i have in here but thankfully they're pretty much all the same size so let's use oh she went she ran away okay so what you want is we're gonna have two on here so you don't you want like the center and then you're gonna do a certain inch from the center so say we're gonna do half an inch on either side let's just say that and see what that looks like yeah i think that will work so i'm just going to line this up let's line it up on here just for you guys so like i would put one here don't want it there and there or doing one over here let's do it over here so just like a quarter of an inch from either side and then the same thing just kind of you just want them to be you know somewhat centered i actually don't want that both i think that'll work it's a little bit different than what i usually do so just kind of so let's see i don't know where his smaller ruler thing is so let's see and then do it that looks here yeah i mean these rulers are neat to have if you're a quilter but it's definitely not necessary we just have one because you know that's crooked okay why is that's crooked that ain't gonna work is it okay michelle figure out what you're doing michelle you're not teaching us nothing okay is my paper crooked my paper is crooked okay so i'm gonna do it right here okay that's what it is my paper is crooked i think so anyways you just want your spots you know lined up see that one's off too oh i didn't line that one up right that's one reason i just use the ones i've already made because another right you know i'm going to see if i'm going to like that or not because you don't want them too far apart but i mean we still have like a quarter of an inch on either side no i'm going to redo it i don't like that okay michelle michelle okay let's do this one i'm just going to trim this one down ah you guys that's one reason i do not like to to make um templates because for one thing it takes a while and for another one it um let's see so eight and a half by two is four and a quarter this one's already have a fold i thought well is that right perfect it's a little bit smaller but that's okay because it doesn't have to be all the way up okay so let's try this again sorry guys i know i know let's just do you know what let's do this easy let's do a half an inch from either side making it too complicated aren't i cap it in from that side and half an inch from this side that looks right right okay and then of course we know where the middle is so i'm making it way way more complicated than it needed to be my brain is got a hundred thousand things going okay i tell you guys sometimes i just overthink things and it doesn't have to be 100 perfect but you know just adjust over early okay and then go ahead and do that and if you wanted to you could just fold that down about an inch inch and a half gracie no you're not helping mama not helping mama at all and i'm just going to line that up make sure it's pretty straight about in the center i'm just making sure everything looks very straight all right most important thing is you put top because if you don't no matter how much you measure it's not going to work out for you so i like to use an eighth inch though um hole punch though if you decided not to that's not a problem because you could just use your um i want to check that video you could just use your um fall and punch a hole to me this is just easier i think i got this at a yard sale so why not use it i think i even listed it in my favorites okay so i'll be right back okay sorry guys um the video for yesterday is having a hard time so it's gonna go up late it looks like it's already one but by now you guys probably already seen it okay so i'm just gonna position this in the center of where i want this to go hi guys by the way sorry here's client i've been i told him he's not working i told him you're probably getting tired of me saying what happened he's like nothing if something happened i would tell you before the door shut yeah i told he said he cut his but he didn't damage his phone but he said he kept painting whenever he looked at it he'd think reminds me of niles and he's a big guy tall and yeah i was thinking oh that's cool i mean i said yeah michelle was going to throw up every time she looked at it no it wasn't throw up it was pass out oh i thought you were on upchuck no it was just i couldn't the world was spinning i couldn't look at it told him i said heck it didn't even hurt didn't even hurt what i did he said his lord hurt like hayden that's because he has all his feeling in his huh i guess yeah i'm sure that's a big part of it but jesus yeah you guys don't know i'm sure most of you know by now but tried to chop his middle finger off but they thought they were gonna have to amputate but he's fine okay guys so now we are going to see i made that harder than i should have made it sorry guys somebody's gonna watch that and say really michelle why don't you just do it like this just making sure you guys are paying attention and she turned it just for you guys so i am doing it just for you guys whenever you make a mistake it's never just a mistake on our end it was just it's yeah a lesson for you guys we are going all the way through our crazy all the way through our um signature because if you put like a fabric clip in here it might be upside down on the other side so pay attention to that because you don't want to have to redo it so even though you think oh everything's right side up i've done that this way you want to make sure it's right side up all the way through okay that looks pretty good like that okay so then but yeah she's been over here and no gracie no clencer do i need to babysit yes oh yeah yeah i got about 20 of them be barfed so wow you've been doing good yeah i probably got about 40 length pieces of wood i'm nice yeah 40 or 50. got a lot done yeah i figured he would i figured you were like really fine i've been doing this for five years you'd think you'd trust me just one time it takes that's all okay so then those lines that you made across that's where we're gonna mark yeah i was updating them on the no gracie go see daddy i was thinking about making uh i had some really nice wood for coasters out there i was looking at that's the right size yeah they might go you never know yeah finished you'd finish them won't you oh you mean sand them in there oh god yeah then they're pretty where's my spots that i eat hi grace what are you doing brad okay let me look again see it i know i'm marked i'm a good girl yes i am daddy okay whatever she's been a good girl i wouldn't need a babysitter i know right again you just want to make sure it's coming right out yeah she is being so honored today and i know it's because i'm let's see if i can you know hold it at a sharp v and it goes straight through the back of the spine and that's what you want if for some reason you went like out the side then just re-gather it and try again because it's easier to do that now than later okay so we have a couple of needles put two of them in here so one this is nylon wax nylon thread that's my favorite for sewing in signatures it doesn't stretch it's caught stretching doesn't it yeah that one stuff i had was horrible yeah yeah yeah and you want a uh kind of dull needle it's just easier you're not poking your own holes that way so and then we want to go in the hole that's going to be in the front i saw some pretty um like different stitches and stuff on pinterest today i was thinking you yeah just different fun you know different ways to right decorative sorry i don't know where it is yeah are you doing a different one are you doing something oh i'm not doing a different now but maybe yeah i might try something different where was that that's talking to me i can't focus that's right through here somewhere there it is okay i always go middle bottom gracie lane middle top get over here well and usually they're napping right now so i don't know why i don't know she's awake unless she heard me talking yeah i know her make sure everything is i can't see it on this fabric so it's kind of like there we go now you just have to kind of finagle it you watch the dumb fish you like the grace did i go in there i didn't go in there maybe i pulled it all out i don't know i'm doing that one i'm having so many problems today yes it is okay good yeah and of course you want to make sure it's straight up you know right side up she don't want to watch them nope she's too grown up for fishies now right apparently so okay so let's see i just double check back here make sure it's nice and snug give it another tug see that didn't take long did it making all those mistakes for you guys all my regulars are probably like whatever michelle she's blowing smoke guys no clint came in while i was checking the to see what the processing was doing and he's like can you redo my my finger i said can you wait until i'm done with this video yeah i feel like i'm so oh well i think it was um with gracie and having to stop and do this that this and the other then so again just i always just go through because if you put and one thing i was going to tell you guys is the envelopes we made i'm just going to put them in here i haven't figured out exactly how but i'm not selling them into the um signature i love this not beautiful gracieland i have my spray bottle if i need it i will use it she can be yeah because didn't he say he would have to bury something gracie yeah i'd say buried about 10 foot away oh yeah he's gracie do wine i'm thinking gracie lynn quit chewing on that does somebody want a cat i'll give you a fence cat i can't have my grace gracie that is not something to eat on let go let go just reach over and grab your water bottle should leave oh that's a good idea gracie grace sitting there playing tug over oh you guys i haven't had a nap either which i haven't really i think it's good it feels like spring i'm not really that tired so that's a good thing okay guys we're gonna try it wish me luck okay it's the right way i have top on the top so let's try this again uh animals i tell ya well we're gonna buy like two have three of those things and keep them up oh you have to call somebody i don't know i'm gonna go grab one wipe things through my hands you just want to make sure it's oh the white it's really out of the that's how you're going to get that like right on the spine sometimes i just kind of pull clint said i stole this from him by all but he's probably right okay i hope i got those right double check okay so two i need to get a container or something put in there for my extra needles uh yeah the mess i had today is kind of like when i first when i first did a um junk journal i talked about this every time but we uh you know what i was gonna look and see if there was any hair or anything i don't see anything i've been trying to keep her keep her away from the thing but yeah um the first time it had like six signatures and the lady who was doing doing it did uh and you guys know who it is if you've been a while but it was a paid course and she just did one big string for six signatures and to do the you know um sew in all of them using that one big string well if you get it upside down then you have to cut every single one of them out and start over so this is my favorite who was it uh mobile home um oh okay okay oh okay when did you tell them hey buddy yes just don't tell longs not want to deal with him but yeah and then so i turned it turned one upside down so then i had to cut them all apart and redo them so and then you after you put them in you glued it down so this is just a headache so that's why i do the three stitch pamphlet stitch three whole panel stitch it's mine of on my choice yeah that one stuff didn't work okay finish this part where is that the mouth can you do the ounce and see what that's on uh where's 45 uploading well i want to see if it sticks or not we'll see because that should be about right okay and then of course i keep all my stuff in one organized chair i'm not really organized but i don't want to have to look for it any time no and since i have this and then i ordered extra so i thought i was ordering two but i was ordering two sets of two so always put my stuff in here even a pen that way i don't have to look for it and then my template so i want to use that on another one you can do that okay guys now what you've been waiting for i don't know if it has enough but i want to decorate the cover so i'm gonna tie this i know someone said she wasn't sure about that but i'm not going to just like slap it on there we're going to decorate it so that is a little bit tighter of course i still have more decorating inside but i've been working on that and i kind of want to see what it's going to look like so i did put it like on lace oops i don't cut that piece off and then i have a needle in here but i think i'm gonna like that and then i was thinking oh wow i like that yeah i kind of um you know made it look nicer than yeah than it had been yeah i really do i really really like it so i made it more like it should be and then i was thinking and i i don't know if i'm going to do this or not let's use this as oh my god i can't believe you said that woman and he had a perfectly good fabric scissors right there in arm's length oh that's just wrong that just hurt my heart didn't you i did i'm sorry yeah i knew but i was thinking i don't know really it go away you started it i was thinking oh i always talk like that woman actually i think did that hurt yeah the amish book i'm reading today the little girl said i'm thinking and she's like oh no i was laughing oh gear i was thinking oh but i was thinking that i would like to like pop it up somehow so i was thinking maybe you know like something underneath just barely sticking out okay buddy i don't know hon what do you think let me see i'm just like something like this just little bits peeking out from under it yay or nay honey i really think it's better the other way without that what kind of but then it does kind of blend in it does blend in so you really can't well let's just try one slow stitching like a ribbon around it oh yeah i have that plan too but maybe i wouldn't need anything if you did that see i was thinking like just folding the pieces and popping them under there i don't know i mean i understand where you're going i don't know yeah i just don't you're just not sure what i should do yeah exactly i mean i think you're on the right track i just i don't know well and i do have like dark purple uh ribbon yeah that i considered that's kind of where i'm leaning that you could whip stitch it on there huh okay let me look and see what i have done i know what well i do have an idea out oh i probably don't have any i was thinking what if you used crochet thread and just kind of weaved it around well i did have this and i thought you know maybe i could just do oh maybe that would work too is just kind of loop it yeah that'd be better underneath it done what do you guys think tell me now tell me now you'll be like thanks a lot michelle that's kind of cute though actually let's look at that if i kind of marked it maybe with your pen uh yeah your marking pen uh it's i don't think i picked it up i think it's right there you know what i could just do it on here maybe that's what i'll do is just this is like glue it so it's popping out like that i like that let's just try it i mean surely i can rip it off right let's see what see what my people are saying i'm trying to read their um thoughts from two days from now yeah can you check that because if it's not going up any higher than we need to push the 45 percent matching which is what it was i'll go first thank you well and it just they just fixed it he was out here two hours i mean for two hours the other day okay so if i do it like this and i just want it just like half an inch showing i'm just going to put a little bit of glue until i know for sure that's what i want to do i don't have to go all the way out or end yeah the other night was a friday night they fixed it after their time off so oh i kind of like that okay well let's keep working on it and see what we can come up with i want to cut it every time and i can come back and glue that down i just want to see what i want to do yeah it was kind of funny though watching reading the um promised book and one of the amish people said that oh god what do you think i think i might like it yeah i like that better where it's just a little bit yeah and i'll put loose all the way around it yeah okay well let me cut all those that way i don't have to keep trying to get my fabric i don't know how many i need so i'm just going to cut them all right we'll stop there yeah so he said that if we got those that big one that we'd have to cart it down or whatever so i wouldn't want to do that i was hoping they would come up and do philly you know well i think we'll go with the little ones well the other guy good other company country when they get theirs we'll just to go have them do one for us oh you think so yeah because they say you didn't have to have to do a pipe yeah yeah we could do that well if that's the case we just need one more instead then two i was just gonna plan on using those from now on i'm using fabri-tac here just because i want to make sure and for the dry time i just didn't want to have to wait on large leather glue is it working now oh good so it must have been that well and i haven't been on my phone or pad in a while so i have that on facebook as long as it's working yeah so i sewed it to that piece of lace like i'm sure you guys noticed that instead of gluing it and i tried to give it like some dimension i think i heard a kitty somewhere talking to you is he over there in your lap yeah no i'm sorry this would be easier if it wasn't um wrinkly but don't work yeah because he said the other guy said if we would be able to just put it right beside you wouldn't need all the pipes and stuff that's true i forgot about that okay so let's try it and i'm just doing like half an inch to my finger i kind of like that what time is it it is just kind of guessing about where i want them to pop out so i'll just hear you guys oh that's horrible it'll be cute when i'm done i think you were on the right side yeah i didn't really like the fabric so i mean i had already planned on putting like a ribbon or something and like as an accent but i think well here well i'll tell you you guys are still getting the word out about sticky crap yeah you've been talking to him on facebook facebook well no sticky crap yeah on youtube who was it she said she went to the store and was asking the lady about the stuff and the lady couldn't understand what she's talking about and she said you know that sticky crap the lady's like oh i know exactly what you're talking about i have such bad influence what what you know that sticky crap a sticky crap that you used to put fabric together oh i know what you're talking about that is funny i don't know what you guys think too much going on what do you think is that too much well i this one's out too far um let me see before i put the other ones on because i can take them off right now if i don't like it what do you think i like it it brings it kind of ties it in okay are you not liking it i'm not sure well like i said you could always just we if you have the smaller one just leave it in them well maybe i don't need so many of them you know yeah let's kind of rearrange them and see maybe i have too many of them and that's why i'm just putting a little bit on them right now just to kind of i think i might like that better what do you guys think where it's just a little bit of uh where it's not so because i took them off here here and here okay what do you think about those and then maybe one right here sorry guys i have no clue what i'm doing but i know you guys like to see videos like this my thought process which could be a scary thing okay i like it i think i'm gonna go with that it's not tons but it's enough to kind of like clint said you're kind of weaving in your your ribbon okay i'm not done yet so don't freak out on me you guys don't freak out on me okay we're gonna glue it down you guys ready for this oh michelle no i'm gonna put it on here here here and we're gonna double check that i have it going the right way that would not be a good thing with it i got stuff all over my finger thank let's just double check that my signatures are going the right way okay that would be my luck uh-oh okay guys here we go wish me luck i really like that actually i think that's really cute and i really just wanted to use this um like vintage sewing of the um iris that's what inspired this you know okay and then it does have a little bit where you can kind of give your iris a little bit of movement just kind of making sure that's how i want it before it starts drying it's kind of cute i like it okay and then make sure there's nothing on here that's gonna get all over the place i've had these to kind of maybe dress it up that's cute maybe we'll kind of put those like around the edges i wonder if i got a long enough piece oh that's pretty guys i like that oh perfect i just cut me a piece when i went outside earlier so this piece glued that together or something it's just not working and then maybe like under i kind of like that start at the bottom we'll see i might make a total mess out of this one yeah it'll work out on it well i wasn't necessarily meaning for you i was thinking about my friends saying that man that that glue i tell you is pretty goopy yeah it is that fabric so we're just kind of position it wherever deleted it i think the whole thing went down because it's not even at the block oh yeah it's at the bottom sorry it looks like our internet's messing up again check her phone gary's not gonna be happy if i love that what do you think of these teardrops oh yeah it looks good do you like it really just saying that can you go over there and push the um google ball you know what i'm talking about don't you on the bottom almost done i don't know why it went down though hope you guys are doing well besides better than me hmm i must reduce we'll see you guys have to let me know what you think be nice that's really cute i don't know what do you guys think let me bring it up i like it i think it turned out really cute trying to make sure you know it's well attached which i can do after it's really dry and then i was thinking i got these really cute charms today i know okay i got these here that's gonna be cute i think and i thought well let's see what we have because we could hang one make it look more like a love and be loved never ever give up live your dream that's a possibility i think on a silver one believe in love it might be all oh here's love love laughs i think i like to live your dream they're all those four or five then we'll just kind of tuck that in there somewhere so i have a bold pen is that weird i don't know i think it'd be cute just tuck it in there hi arby what you doing lovely okay i like it what do you guys think let me know in the comments thanks for watching um i hope this was helpful at least it was fun for me so hopefully it was fun for you thanks for watching be sure and hit that subscribe button give this video a thumbs up and we will see you guys in the next video see you soon bye bye guys you for visiting tech teams you", "opYfOb6Ig5c": "don't have time for coloring then this is a fun technique for you [Music] hi there it's therese from lostinpaper and i've got some beautiful flowers from ellen hudson i haven't used these in a while and i just thought with the style of these stamps they would make really good line art images which makes for a fun quick card like no coloring if you need a card in a hurry this is a really good technique and you can actually use so many different kinds of stamps with this but i thought i'd do two floral cards today i wanted them to be bright and cheery because there are cards for a couple of girls who are retiring at work and i thought what better way to do that than have like a watercolor wash background and then i was thinking i haven't smushed in a while and if you haven't smooshed before and you're not a confident color this is a great technique i've got two pieces of bristol smooth cardstock which is um a nice sort of it's not watercolor cardstock but it does tolerate quite a bit of water and what i'm doing here is actually just working on my craft mat i'm adding the actual ink directly to the mat from the ink pad and i've just grabbed some distress ink colors that i thought would work well together and i will of always like as i usually do have every product that i've used today listed below as much as i can otherwise they'll also be listed at my blog and of like a full list of all the details and more pictures and you can link to pinterest and see what else i've been up to over there as well but basically i'm just adding some water to the ink and then picking it up with a piece of acetate that's all this is you could even use stamp packaging anything that you have on hand anything that's non-porous that's going to pick up this ink to spread it further i'm just pressing down on the acetate and letting the water do its thing now i didn't want to wait for it to dry today so i have got my heat tool here and i've got it on the low setting you can use a normal heat tool if you've only got one with the high setting but just make sure not to hold it too close to your paper and keep the tool moving so it doesn't burn your cardstock now i did come in with the pink on one of the pieces but i didn't want to do the same on the second so here i'm just sort of looking through my colors and trying to work out um i was going for like an analogous look so i thought it needed some more peacock feathers i just that was easy enough to come in and add that and all these bits of ink that are off to my side can actually be used on another piece of cardstock you don't have to wipe it away and waste it like i'm doing today but i was just wanting to do these two cards today but you could certainly just grab it another piece of cardstock or even just some normal neenah and drop it into those puddles of ink as you're going along now it's time to do the line art and that's simply exactly what it is it means no coloring you can just leave the stamp to shine on its own and to work out where i want to put it and what works beneath i'm just using the packaging here it's as simple as that to do it i do like to remove the stamp from the packaging it just gives me a better idea of the look especially if you've used your stamp a few times and it's a little bit on the dirty side well not dirty stained loved and then i can just use my misti tool here to stamp my images out and i'm using a nice dark black pigment ink you know like the one i've got here is the nocturne but the obsidian from altenew is awesome as well i just use whichever one i grab out of my drawer they're both wonderful and i did actually hit these i stamped them twice to make sure there's i've got that i got a good impression the bristol smooth is that though it's smooth cardstock so it does stamp well but i did actually come in and hit it with my heat tool just a little bit to make sure that it dried before i started um i didn't want to smudge the ink because it is a bit slower to dry on the bristol here what i'm doing is lining up one of the rectangles because i know i'm going to be cutting these panels out with some of the ellen hudson essential rectangles it's a a layering die set wonderful set actually has like double the amount of rectangles like it's back to back so you've got every possible size that you could need and i wanted to center it on these colors so i just used that rectangle on the base i knew where i wanted to put it i used a slightly larger size on that's the mondo the one i'm die cutting now is actually called the set's called you should know and the the analogous like the blue green one that's the mondo pansy they're both beautiful stamps and really kind of um great to watercolor or just color with any medium really and this is one of the best things about these rectangles is they give you a border as you die cut them you get a really cool border out of each layer and i did do a double layer of foam here to pop up my panel in the center of that and added a sentiment which is from the nicer view set it has a coordinating die set and i just created a whole sheet of these all at once one stamp one heating boss one card and you've got 20 sentiments i don't know how many i'm lying a lot a lot of sentiments ready to go my second sentiment it comes from one of the random totally random sayings it's the volume one set i've white heat embossed it on some black cardstock and i wanna make it like a circle sentiment so i did just line up a to get it perfectly centered i just lined up a template that i die cut already and i also came in and i did pop that panel up on that one but not the outside portion and then added some jewels and crystals from the pinkfresh studio sets which i love thanks so much for joining me today i hope you were inspired to try some liner it's really quick and easy way to get some beautiful floral cards if you do please tag me and let me know what you created i'd love to see it if you liked the video please click on the thumbs up button and if you haven't

Washington and I'm going to show you how to mix automotive paint so what we have here is we have a whole assortment of different types of paint and what I'm going to try to convey to you is that different brands of paint all mix in a very similar manner and there are some tips and tricks that you need to look out for so that you mix them correctly because if you don't mix them correctly then all kinds of really bad things can happen the paint won't harden properly it won't spray properly it won't have the right viscosity to work in your gun and you can just ruin it it won't match subsequent top coats that you need to put on it so one of the most common types of paint is a base coat clear coat and this is a base coat and again depending on what brand of paint they have a different method for how to mix it sometimes it's mixed with a one type of thinner and a hardener on top of that sometimes it's mixed with just a reducer and so what I'm going to try and convey to you today is how you figure out what needs to be added to the paint and what ratio needs to be mixed and nine times out of ten you can find that information directly on the side of the can this is a this is a very common pain as a PPG paint and it tells you with a picture and then also a ratio of the two different types this right here is a DBC and that's the actual base coat and the DT is a reducer so it mixes one-to-one with color and the reducer and so what you want to do is you want to get a paint cup that is specifically for mixing automotive paints it won't deteriorate it won't melt and then on the sides of the cup you'll see all of these different little legends and so if I want to mix one to one you find up here one to one on that paint cup and then each one of these marks corresponds to the level at which you need to fill this Cup you go up to the seven with the paint and then you go to the next column over and you go up to the seven with the thinner so it's one part of paint one part of thinner and you can see they have it already marked out for a whole bunch of different ratios 2 to 1 1 to 1.5 3 2 1 4 2 1 8 to 1 and then they also have gradients in milliliters ounces and just generic scale this is this doesn't mean anything so if you wanted to mix 1 to 1 you would go to 5 parts of paint go to the 5 line and then 5 more up to the 10 line with the thinner getting a little bit more complicated is this is a single stage paint and if you can zoom in on there you can see that there's a whole bunch of different options for different products that you can mix DCC that's this paint a DT is a reducer and then a Dec X is the hardener so they want this paint mixed 4 to 2 to 1 so that means 4 parts of this paint 2 parts of the reducer and 1 part of the activator or hardener so the way you would do that is you would want 4 parts of the one so you go four of the paint two parts of the reducer so you'd go up to six with the reducer and one part of the hardener so you'd go up to the 7 so it's 4 to 2 to 1 so if you do your math and you think about these cups you can pretty much mix any kind of paint here's clear coat this one's very simple again you always look at the side of the of the can and it says it needs to be mixed 2 to 1 so 2 parts of the clear coat with 1 part of the hardener again you can find that directly on the side of the cup used to find 2 to 1 and then all these different gradients correlate to 2 to 1 so if you only need a little bit of clear coat you'd put the clear coat up to the 2 mark and then the next column over you'd find the to mark and you put the hardener to the level goes up to that again here's a completely different brand but on the side of the can it tells you specifically how you're supposed to all the information you need now if hypothetically the paint mixing information is not on the can go to the manufacturers website and what I always keep at my paint mixing station is a three-ring binder and you can see this we've used this a lot and inside I print off all of the different types of paint that I generally use including the primers all of their technical information so DBC for example that was the first base coat that I showed you where you mix it one to one well if you go to the manufacturers website you can print off technical information specifically for DBC and they do a great job of outlining the different additives that you can use what type of tip you need to run for your gun all kinds of different things like the amount of time you need to spend between your coats so go check out the manufacturers website and you can download and print off all this technical information as well as safety information finally if you still are not sure after checking the website and checking the side of the can call the paint company that sold you the paint they should be able to provide you with all the information that you need as well as all the chemicals and all of the safety equipment that you need to mix and spray paint successfully", "ebPuo96CA6Y": "you know as with many things in life there's often more than one way to arrive at the same end result same holds true of calculating the mix ratio on plural component resin systems in this video I want to show you one of the easier methods we tend to use and explain each step as we go along as mentioned in our video on mixing materials it'd be great if all of our systems were 1:1 by weight and volume but the reality is that we formulate our systems for the best material performance without trying to make sacrifices to force an easy to calculate ratio this means that the ratios can vary from one material to the next based on balances in a and B chemistry once you learn this technique you'll find it much easier to calculate ratios and you'll be confident that you're achieving accurate results to start off bjb always list the ratio in a logical alphabetical order of a than B many people over the years have assumed that the a side is always 100% and the B side varies but there are many systems that vjv manufacturers that will have a reverse scenario where the B side is 100% and the a side is lower so let's get started on the math the most common scenario for measuring out materials would be that you have a fixed amount you wish to mix for this example we'll pretend we're trying to mix up a total of 200 grams the unit of measurement whether it's grams pounds kilos ounces doesn't really have an effect on the formula the finished values will be based on the unit's you start with in this case grams if our material system has a mix ratio of a hundred to forty five we really want to refer to this as 100% a to 45% be the act of calling it a percent will make the math much simpler and easy to calculate we'll get to that in just a minute add one hundred percent to forty five percent and you get one hundred forty five percent take two hundred grams and divide it by the one hundred forty five percent now there's two ways to do this which work the same if you have a calculator with a percent sign type two hundred divided by one forty-five and hit the percent sign if you don't have a percent sign on your calculator then you type two hundred and divided by one point 4 5 which is the decimal form of one hundred forty-five percent either way you do it the number you get will be the value for the one hundred and the ratio which is one thirty seven point nine three the balance between the 200 and the one 37.9 3 is the value for the 45 in this ratio I simply take 200 subtract one thirty seven point nine three and get sixty two point zero seven if the ratio is reversed as in 45 to 100 the formula is exactly the same except that we put the one thirty seven point nine three under the B side and the 60 207 under the a side I'll give you another common scenario using the same hundred to forty five mix ratio let's assume you've poured out some a site into a container as a rough estimate of how much material you need now you have to calculate how much B site is needed once you've weighed the a side you can simply multiply that number by forty five percent or 0.45 to find out how much B is needed to add to the a for my experience in calculating ratios and watching others do the same reducing the manual inputs you have to make into a calculator will lower your chance of making a calculating error as I said before there are other methods of calculating the ratio but in comparison we feel this is a simpler solution", "Z6vxDThqmws": "if your outdoor equipment has a

measure up with good quality measuring spoons and cups you don't need too fancy or expensive ones just simple basic and easy to use here's what every home cook should have measuring spoons liquid measuring cups and dry measuring cups let's talk spoons first they come in graduated sizes that include 1/8 teaspoon 1/4 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon 1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon measuring spoons work for wet or dry ingredients to measure a dry ingredient dip in the spoon and level it off with the back of a knife to measure a wet ingredient hold the spoon level and pour in the liquid until the spoon is completely full next our measuring cups it's a good idea to have 2 different types of measuring cups one for liquids like milk water or oils and another set for dry ingredients like flour or sugar the basic measuring cup for liquid is usually clear and has measurement printed on the side this type of measuring cup also has a handle a pouring spout and plenty of headroom in case ingredients expand the most useful measuring cups are heat proof microwave safe glass or hot ingredients as well as cool to read a liquid measure accurately put the cup on a flat surface and bend down so you can see the measurement at eye level sticky thick liquids like molasses honey or corn syrup are measured best by wiping down the inside of the cup or measuring spoon with a little oil or butter before you pour the thin coat of grease helps it pour out again easily and completely for shortening scoop it out of the container and press it into the cup or spoon to force out any air bubbles or pockets then level it off and four stick butter just measure using the increments marked right on the paper wrapper slice off what you need don't be tempted to pour ingredients into your measuring cup or spoon while holding it over the top of your mixing bowl it's too easy to accidentally spill in more than you need now let's measure dry ingredients dry measuring cups are different from liquid cups and common sizes for 1/4 cup third cup 1/2 cup and one cup to fill the cup use the dip and sweep method for dry ingredients such as rice or granulated sugar just dip and fill the cup then sweep level with a knife flour and powdered sugar take a little extra finesse white and whole wheat flour is easily compacted so it should be stirred first then spooned into the measuring cup and leveled off powdered sugar needs to be sifted in order to remove lumps before measuring brown sugar has more moisture so pack it firmly into the measuring cup or spoon before leveling with the knife also pay close attention to how our recipe is worded if it says one cup sifted flour make sure to sift the flour first and then measure one cup 1 cup flour , sifted measure it first and then sift it it's always a good idea to follow the recipe the way it is written the first time you try it then improvise later when you're familiar with how the ingredients all come together with inexpensive and basic measuring

in with our gas today there's just a few things you want to remember first off is when you're mixing and breaking in your engine you want to go two tanks at 16 one ratio with your oil we're going to go ahead and use a synthetic blend we recommend a synthetic blend or better just a full synthetic pay more for your oil now because in the end they'll just make your engine last a whole lot longer we're also going to go ahead and use our Maxima quick to mix bottle today it's going to make our lives a lot easier they have all kinds of different mixture measurements on here I'm gonna go ahead and demonstrate how to mix the oil we're going to go ahead with the 16 one ratio this is one gallon of gas so we're going to go ahead and mix in eight ounces of our of our oil so let's go ahead and do that right now I'm gonna go ahead and open the oil buddy crack the seal we're gonna go ahead use our quick to mix bottle it already has the markings on it right here on the side we have the eight ounce mark go ahead and pour that in here I'm gonna line that up with the eight ounce bar so we're at eight ounces here I'd recommend a funnel if you can makes it much much easier to mix the oil and with your gas here this is gonna be a little tricky because I forgot my funnel so we're gonna go ahead and try to baby this in here then we have it that's the next year oil is now mixed with the gasoline mix it up as well we got about that mixes as well as possible when you're in the breaking-in period make sure that you do not go over 20 miles an hour so you want to vary the RPMs make sure that the engine kind of just breaks in softly you don't want to push it too hard that's just once again gonna just make that engine will last a whole lot longer you don't want to run it for too long we recommend them less than a half hour 20 minutes a very short period of time just run it for the first two tanks make sure that when you run it it's nice and cool when you start it up the next time we're just going to break that engine in and is going to run really well if you have any other questions or comments or any other ideas that you might have for videos with us here at bike Barre just

are\nin 6 pounds? So we have 6 pounds\nand we need to convert them to ounces. And if you don't know it\nalready, you'll know it now, that there are 16 ounces\nper pound. So what we want to do is we\nwant to have pounds in the denominator. It's in the numerator\nright now. So we want to divide by pounds\nand multiply by ounces. Maybe I'll write it out. And I just told you\nthat there are 16 ounces for every 1 pound. So if we multiplied these two\nexpressions, this pounds will cancel with that pounds, and\nwe'll just be left with the unit of ounces, which is what we\nwant, and we just multiply 6 times 16. So it works out unit-wise, and\nit makes sense as well. If we have 16 ounces per pound,\nand we have 6 pounds, we just have to multiply\n6 times 16. That'll be the total number of\nounces we have. So this is going to be equal to--\nwhat's 6 times 16? So if you take 16 times\n6, 6 times 6 is 36. Carry the 3. 6 times 1 is 6, plus 3 is 9. So 6 times 16 is 96. You have this divided by 1 here,\nbut that's not going to change anything. And then all we're\nleft with in the dimensions are the ounces.

for a project I will use a small kitchen scale and do everything based on the grams of dye so if I'm making a stock solution I will measure out say 5 grams of dye dissolve it in 500 milliliters of water for a 1% stock solution but this does add an additional step and has an additional server requirement and so there are some people who might prefer safer one skein of yarn to measure a quarter teaspoon on a teaspoon of dye and go about it that way the big reason to weigh your dye by grams versus by volumes is that the manufacturers mix these dye stocks they can keep it about the weight and the colors that you can achieve per weight of dye they recommend specific on weight of goods for example Dharma training company recommends and on weight of goods of 1.5% to 2% for most of their colors and then for some of their more saturated colors they recommend that you use a non weight of goods of 4% which would be 4 grams of dye per 100 grams to achieve the advertised color since I needed to make up some stocks today anyway I thought that while I'm weighing out my 5 grams of dye for each of these colors that it could be worth me using measuring spoons and measuring the volume as I go along and yeah who knows what we'll see as always I will be wearing gloves safety glasses and wearing a respirator while dealing with the powders so that way I don't inhale or accidentally get anything in my eye or anything like that we're going to start today with the paler cherry bomb and let's try measure one teaspoon of dye this is approximately leveled right here let's see how much the boys okay so that looks about two point eight grams right now all right let's do now a half teaspoon and again this is approximate okay so 4.2 4.3 it's good that there is some consistency on the food day for the same amount of that but it can really depend and the volume that you get in to the pen and how compact your powders are or even probably from color to color I'm not sure that we will see the same kind of weights with different colors necessarily all right next color is dirt navy and we're gonna get one teaspoon two point three grams so I'm gonna go ahead and do a second teaspoon oh that one was and that one was merde so the first one I got two point three grams the second one gave us about 3 grams of dye this one was notable because we get shootable teaspoons in a row and you can give us different weight I need the difference between two point three grams two point four grams and three grams insignificant the extra half gram of dye can make a difference in your depth of shape depending on the color now I think that we got such a different weight because one of our spoonfuls our second one that was more compact than the first one and so this was actually a really good example of what I wanted to show finally the last color I we know today is peacock blue and let's weigh out approximately a quarter teaspoon for about point nine grams second one that is pretty consistent so fun I was having consistency within this color but wait nine brands for a quarter teaspoon okay we've now added four quarter teaspoons and we have 3.6 grams again this is different a different weight per volume that what we've seen for the other colors this one is clearly more compact food I have been over filling my quarter teaspoon with this color definitely I definitely could have been doing that but oh yeah was measuring out what should be approximately one teaspoon we've got everywhere friend you know 2.3 to 3.6 grams which is a huge difference so why is this important and it really is only important if you're concerned about consistency because the density of your dye how compact or how fluffy it is can vary from when you first open it to when you use it a couple months later or even between one batch versus another from the same supplier so if you're gonna get like a huge variability when you're dealing with a specific volume of your dye powder then you could get inconsistent color results which is only a problem if you have a recipe and you are trying to replicate it so if you want to make a recipe for achieving a specific shade or a specific color way it makes a bit more sense to go for grams if you die more by feel and it's okay if there's some variability and what you within the end by all means you can go by volume there's nothing wrong with it one of my favorite techniques is just to go straight from the dye powder where I'm not doing any measuring at all I'm just dying by feel so that is absolutely okay but ultimately as long as you are consistent with the way that you measure the color you will likely end up with some reproducible results but there could be a fluke and you get one overpacked spoon and then suddenly your colors a lot more intense which you know you can always add more color but you can't exactly take it away so that could be a problem I am happy that I can finally answer a question and say alright there's between I guess like 2.3 and 3.6 grams of dye per one teaspoon and it really probably varies not just on the compactness of the dye but it could also vary a lot on the color different colors could have different volumes per weight just because they're made up of different molecules they have different amounts of filler and things like that when you're speckling with dermis silvered gray and true black the colors look of the specks of the actual dye and there looks pretty indistinguishable but there's no question that there's got to be some kind of filler in that silver gray dye stock so that way you can measure out a full gram versus having to do a fraction of the gram to get that more true gray versus sort of a deep gray this is something I talked about in the math of yarn dyeing where we actually went and looked at the different depths of shade of silver gray and true black and how they compare versus the amount of dye used for each of those scans I'll have a link to that video in the video description and my card anyway I hope that this was really helpful and helped answer some questions I have no problem dying by feel you don't need to do strict calculations to get beautiful results it's totally okay to go with the flow and just have fun but it's just when you want something more reproducible kitchen skills aren't that expensive and it's worth getting one one another thing the accuracy of your kitchen scale is something also to consider with this there's no question there can be some variability there and I know this particular scale has trouble when you're adding little amounts that are less than say point 2 grams sometimes in like itty-bitty increments sometimes those don't necessarily register right away it's important to keep that in mind and so if you're dealing with really low weights that you want to measure take that into account when you go and purchase a scale I am Rebecca from cabinets and if you found this video helpful make sure you subscribe

of problems that have to do with measurements in ounces and pounds in the first one they're asking how many Ounces are in a certain number of pounds and in the second one we're doing some subtraction which can get a little bit tricky the key fact you need to know is how many ounces are there in a pound and if you don't know it's 16 so 16 ounces equals 1 pound actually I guess we say lb for pound and what I like to do is write this as a ratio a special kind of ratio that people either call a unit multiplier or I like to call a conversion factor and you can write this ratio in either of two ways you could have pounds on top one pound is 16 ounces or you could have 16 ounces on top and one pound on the bottom and in various situations you might need to use one or the other when you convert from one unit to another what you do is you multiply by a conversion factor by a unit multiplier so what we're starting with is 4 pounds I'll put the unit's in there and I like to write this as a fraction so I just put a 1 on the bottom that's the same thing as 4 pounds but I've put it in the form of a fraction because I'm going to multiply it by another fraction now which one of these do I pick to multiply to convert this into ounces the trick is that you want if you have pounds on the top to begin with you want pounds on the bottom in your unit multiplier so I'm going to choose this one so I'm going to multiply this by 16 ounces on the top and 1 pound on the bottom the reason I want pounds on the bottom is because I want to end up with ounces that's what the question says how many ounces when you have pounds on the top and pounds on the bottom you cancel those so those units cancel out and what you're left with after you do the math is just ounces now I simply multiply these fractions 4 times 16 on the top one times one on the bottom so let's see 4 times 16 what is that 64 and one on the bottom I could write 64 over 1 or I could just leave it as 64 it's 64 ounces that how many Ounces are in four pounds this next one asks us to subtract 216 pounds three ounces from a hundred and seventy three pounds or minus 173 pounds 14 ounces so I'm going to write it out like a traditional subtraction problem here 16 pounds three ounces on the top minus 173 pounds 14 ounces here now when I start this I start here with the ounces and what I notice is I have three ounces minus fourteen ounces and just like in regular subtraction if the number is smaller here I have to borrow from the next unit over while the next unit over is in pounds and I'm going to take away one pound from that 216 that makes this 215 and I get one pound over here but I need to convert it to ounces before I add it in so I don't put a 1 here what I put in is a 16 plus 3 so really this is 19 ounces now minus 14 ounces while 19 ounces minus 14 ounces is 5 ounces so that worked out now we can continue on with my subtraction 5 minus 3 is 2 1 minus 7 I have to borrow again so that becomes a 1 I put a 10 really or you know a 1 in front of the 1 that becomes 11 minus 7 that's 4 and then 1 minus 1 is 0 so it's 42 pounds oops and 5 ounces", "3yQHLbMBSf0": "hey guys and welcome back to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make the best custard a delicious bread pudding you will ever have topped with a vanilla bourbon sauce this recipe comes from meanies cafe and is directly on their website I did change a few ingredients though but let me show you how easy this is to make I'm going to start off getting my raisins ready I've got half a cup of raisins here in a small bowl and I'm just going to cover these with some boiling water this is going to soften up those raisins and make them so they're not so dry and tough in our finished bread pudding I'm going to let these soak for about a half-hour or so if you don't like raisins you can leave them out by all means next I'm going to get my bread ready I've got a 1 pound loaf of a French bread this is just store-bought Bakery French bread it's a good all-around bread for this and I'm just going to tear this into pieces and place the pieces into an 8 inch by 8 inch glass baking dish don't have to use glass don't have to use 8 by 8 you could use a 9 by 9 if you have that but you want to completely fill this pan with the bread pieces a 1 pound loaf does this if you're using some other kind of loaf of bread you want to make sure that you really load up the bread in this because once that bread is soaked up all the custard mixture that we're going to make here in a minute it's really going to compact down so fill this pan as high as you can get it within reason of course but I find a 1 pound French loaf works best for this now to get our custard ready you want a very large bowl here and I'm going to crack in 4 large eggs in here this makes a lot of custard so definitely use a large bowl for this and to my eggs I'm going to add in a quarter of a cup of plain granulated sugar as well as 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and I'm also going to add in one stick which is 1/2 a cup of butter that I've gone ahead and melted and I let that cool just a little bit because y'all want to scramble your eggs when you had it in there and using a whisk I'm just going to whisk these ingredients together until those eggs are nicely broken up now to season this I'm going to use nutmeg if you've never used whole nutmeg and ground it yourself definitely do that the nutmeg that you buy pre ground party in those little containers they have no flavor compared to fry crowd nutbag so get a whole nutmeg and grind it yourself that is definitely preferable in this just going to whisk that together just mix it in a little bit and while I'm whisking I'm going to add in two cups of half-and-half you could also use cream for this and I'm also going to add in one cup of whole milk now you can use all cream you could use all half-and-half you can use all whole milk or any combination thereof I just like doing two cups of half-and-half one cup of milk it what makes the best bread pudding for me and now you want to add all of your bread into this custard mixture basically what you're going to do is just push your bread down into that custard mixture and let the bread absorb all of this liquid surprisingly it actually will if you have enough bread in there you just want to make sure that you allow each piece to absorb as much of this custard mixture as possible so just keep pushing it down pushing it down pushing it down and I like to let this sit for about a half an hour before I put it into my baking dish just so it you know all that bread can absorb as much of that liquid as it possibly can then I'm going to start transferring this into my baking dish that I filled up with the bread earlier and I'm going to layer this with my raisins the reason I don't have the raisins into the custard is because those raisins are just going to sink to the bottom so doing this way gives you a nice dispersion of raisins in your finished bread pudding so I put about a third of the bread mixture into my dish then I'm going to sprinkle some of the raisins right on top and I'm going to layer this up like lasagna and then I'm going to finish that up with the rest of my bread and custard mixture make sure that all of that gets into your pan you can see that this pan is very full take the rest of your raisins sprinkle those right on top and then you want to bake your bread pudding in a preheated 325 degree fahrenheit oven for between 40 and 45 minutes now you know this is going to be done when the center is just set it's going to be kind of like if you've ever made pumpkin pie cheesecake or something you want the center not completely set it will finish cooking once it comes out of the oven now before I serve my bread pudding I'm going to get my sauce ready I've just got a small saucepan here and I'm going to crack in a large egg and whisk that egg up make sure it's completely broken up before I add any more ingredients to that and then I'm going to add in three-quarters of a cup of half-and-half you could also use whole milk or cream as well as half of a cup of sugar I'm sort of whisk this together to dissolve that sugar a little bit also make sure that that egg is nicely whisked into the cream and before I turn the heat on I'm going to put in a dash of cinnamon as well as a splash of pure vanilla extract again nutmeg grind up just a little bit in there maybe eighth of a teaspoon or so and then finally I'm going to add in a splash of Jim Beam bourbon you don't have to add the alcohol if you don't want to but it really does take the sauce to the next level I'm going to whisk this make sure that every ingredient is corporated nicely and I'm going to turn the heat on to low and I'm going to cook this sauce until it becomes nice and thick make sure that you whisk this constantly because you don't want any scrambled eggs and your finished sauce and you know your sauce is done when it coats the back of a spoon it is nice and thick it'll thicken up even more as it cools a little bit you can see here the consistency that it should be kind of a thin pudding if you will almost a custard in and of itself here and then you can go ahead and cut yourself a slice of your bread pudding and try and work it out first slice is always the hardest but take it nice and slow and you can always get that first piece out and then you want to drizzle the top with you that vanilla bourbon sauce and go ahead and serve that up and that is how you make Mimi's Cafe version of bread pudding this bread pudding like I said is absolutely fantastic it's the best bread pudding that there is it's nice and custardy love the raisins in there they're nice and plump they're not tough and chewy like some of the other bread puddings that don't soak the raisins but there you go that bourbon sauce really takes this bread pudding over the top give this video a thumbs up if you'd enjoyed thanks so much for watching and we will see you next time you", "5qadjwNcPSg": "[Music] hi guys I'm Sonia longest welcome to Asia I'm at home and today I'm going to show you this trendy Korean barbecue menu which is a flavour for Italy sounds already really really amazing so it's pretty much a slices of pork belly marinade 88 different the flavor so it's really delicious it's really fun to make just on the weekend yeah you know like you just cook different manner each time it's just so much fun like oh what is this this thing Oh what is that this like oh it's funny what about this was like a whole time you're eating this you wanna have so much fun the first thing you need to do is it go today shall mark a warrior which I shall get the pork belly and come home this each slices are six ounce you can either pin on one and six hours of a thinner profile they may be two or three slices just marinate it or you can use like just one thick slice of properly about a PhD a little half each day if you are using this one piece of six ounce a half inch deep pork belly then you need to score the meat so this way the properly actually cook more faster so you don't have to wait around to the home where is cookie and also a world of job or the marinade all the way and is gonna be making extra delicious so I'm doing about 1/8 inch scoring so all you need to just make sure if you don't cut through the pole okay that's just you need to remember and make sure your knife is nice and sharp take your time and you did it diagonal and go on this side like this and then turn the fork 90 degrees and then do the same action so you don't have to change your angle totally I'll beat her there so you don't have to go through just turn the pork is at 90 degrees right 90 degrees 90 degrees and just repeat what you just did on both sides of the pork like right here and the front as well so all the flavor goes into there so this is eight flavoured properly we're gonna marinate each one of them very very very different marinade so I'm so excited one by one I will walk you through the first one is my absolute favorite the original the original original - original nothing on it but the pork just in the back what flavor is done there was my favorite you couldn't do this I'm doing in in a plastic bag like small size prospect because this is so convenient to do and I can actually mark down with my sharpie which flavor is what kind of thing but if you don't go like this much with me then you can just do like you know like a little bit more and go through that surface flavor number one today or is it I stopped that put it right here and flavor number two so you will need a tablespoon I'll chop the garlic goes in to the marinade back and 1/2 teaspoon of salt so what I actually originally did when I was doing the recipe testing I was actually chopping the garlic and the salt all together you know the salt too will melt down the garlic or the flavor will come out but you know what I'm making a tea from flavors already I don't really have to go through that much trouble so I'm just going to rub the garlic with the salt the key of this mayonnaise as well you don't want to marinate to be overpowered of properly because the end of all Korean barbecue we serve with some dipping sauces and it's certain what other side the dishes to enjoy together so having the flavor is great but make sure it's not to overpower it so over salty so that's what I was going through so this marinade is perfect for 6us of the pork slices or proto slice so one or two or three is dependable the thickness or thickness that you're using rub rub rub or together right if you ask me some yeah this is a pretty much garlic and the salt can I use that lick don't you know why not put it in your jaw labor number 2 garlic is done so excited number 3 what is it I cannot remember the a flavor on it I need to see my note number 3 is wine when I was like early 20s late teenager to early 20s this was like a trendy pork belly in Korea which is wine for belly wine some website it was trendy and makes you really glad to see this coming back to the trend because it's so delicious boy tablespoons over red wine so you can use it like white wine too if you have I just happen to have it's red wine hopefully and wine oh yes just let it swim around oh yes close it tightly flavor number three the wine as the flavor number four earth this flavor we have really nice progress presence nice fragrant fragrance for this I decide to use our tip Provence the French style of the or mixture has rosemary some Devender just really really delicious and so flora and so much fragrance the soil mixtures but if you already have like the Italian our mixture go ahead and use that that would be really delicious chip so one teaspoon oh my god this this my measures with is so cute but because of a has a like a little leaf it would put one teaspoon of our de Provence or the Italian or mix 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of cooking oil you can use any oil olive oil canola oil vegetable oil or whatever all you do that you have just do not use the sesame oil okay teaspoon of water so the water actually will rehydrate the herbs and you will help bring out more fragrance to the marinade properly in love this broke this herb marinade all over the portfolio so you won't absorb all the delicious flavor flavor number four the herb it's done okay number five flavor number five what is it the carry or the curry you will need a spoon of curry powder half teaspoon of salt and teaspoon of mayonnaise yes don't question about mayonnaise in this marinade just go ahead and add and taste it there and tell me about it because you will have you just like oh my god so good I'm glad I listened to some young and I trust the son thank you Oh Oh the mayonnaise once again me before he was nothing like talking maybe you saw me I probably right I talk too much but so what I have a big mouth sorry not sorry you could use a yogurt make a very young style but mayonnaise works because we're gonna marinate we're gonna use the mayonnaise in different mayonnaise upcoming upcoming merriment open it back up to add our pork belly rubbing time keep some love and the massage properly be delicious properly the delicious flavor of a cent number number five number five the curry next flavor number number six start reducing the numbers now flavor number six is pinning down the Korean firm it's the bean paste you can use me so if you already have a missile in your refrigerator or if your potential quotient is eating junk I love a pen junk in this recipe you will need a 1 tablespoon of training channel and one teaspoon of mayonnaise don't charge the mayonnaise with in job if you haven't tried yet and one clove of garlic either chopped or graded mayonnaise is just really helping the pork belly nice and moist and you could it's just like teaspoon of oil trust me mayonnaise does it's magic and I was trying to make this marinade all the mayonnaise and as simple as possible as well not like adding salt and pepper and garlic on everything you gotta mean because I want each ingredients flavor it pops out when you taking by the curry the curry puffs are when you're taking by it all depends on drink that pops up like you know what I mean rock climbing flavor number six flavor number six Penta s tan okay we have only two flavors left flavor number seven is good to Jack since we haven't made any spicy version yet so I'm gonna make coach cheetah 1 tablespoon of cooked Shuja Korean red pepper paste gochujang is Penny's spicy sweet so much flavor in here but if you cannot find the co2 john-boy the news may be suited up for this recipe and at the NATO pinch of sugar and the half teaspoon of sugar so if you are using a studio doctrine instead of a coach's job what samba go ahead and use a teaspoon of sugar instead of a half all right and 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar nice and tangy worked as a bumping up the hood to jump fillet but just need a more extreme by adding the sugar and the vinegar because Christian is already tangy and sweet but we're trying to this just bump up that flavor so the thing too you can just go ahead and triple or four times the recipe and make just one month just one flavor only two flavors you can just choose couple over the flavors of what I'm showing you today but when you can make eight flavors it's so much fun why not making April a breeze so cute all flavor number seven kochujang as done last number eight the soy sauce I'm pretty sure you guys are wondering why doesn't she make that tiny flavor soy sauce margarita you and they the two tablespoons of soy sauce and yes when you say soy sauce you have to say like meat soy sauce one green onion the finely chopped and one garlic either grated or charge 1 tbsp red wine and 1 tablespoon of sugar some black pepper no sesame oil Louise it'll be the letters last finale the flavor ate soy sauce alright so now we have the soy sauce the original trend entirely wine urn curry and a what they put it put you down oh my god I'm losing it I'm losing it too many flavors ombre thing is so you can make marinated these overnight so I highly recommend to make them overnight before you serve so make sure to you make this the day before okay so yeah I'm so sad in my world so what do you think of my spread of a flavored pork comment below which flavor was your favorite and which one you wanna try the most honestly you could use a different cut of pork you don't absolutely have to use appropriately if you're not trying to express this recipe but only thing is a hard time for you is finding a pork belly then go ahead and use a pork pot actually pork lard will be yeah really delicious for this recipe as well just make sure that each recipe die marinated is for the 6th of a piece of pork I spread it with my little fancy you know that's a little handy dandy it's a tray or plate I'm not sure exactly I got from the crate on bail if I pronounced it right whatever just doing out there in case you guys want to purchase that you I have a little disapproval guess not nice in that gas stove table grill that you can actually cook this on the table I got this from Instagram or if you already have like portable gas stove and the Korean barbecue grill just go ahead and use that and some side dishes I served with I have this spicy or not spicy chewy bean sprouts pulling them on with chimps eyes at this recipe right here go ahead and check it out that recipe is a killer and I do have a spinach decided this recipe as well shave them tina-marie check it out right here I actually made the regular and spicy version as well spinach at so delicious Korean style you can get a lot of it so check it out right up here and moussing check cool young radish side dish is more like a salad more like a kimchi but it's not really kimchi but I also have a recipe for this tube this is amazing for peeping pop as well so check it out recipe right yeah right here for a moving check and oh my god I have so many side dishes recipes but you can choose whatever whatever you serve together I also have but this sum down some Jong is a Korean barbecue dipping sauce a very typical traditional Korean style barbecue dipping sauce if you wanna know those this is some Jang recipe the link down below on my website I did not a video because I mean it's like so far - so is it just like making this and missing Batman makes a good dad are you done kind of video so on my websites there's a written airspeed so go ahead and check the link down below and this is a new this is a green tea salt that this is my favorite dipping sauce for just eight flavors from the upside because since they all have a very they are distinct they are very unique flavor already observed in so in my opinion something is really good with ping junghwa put it on one but I'm not sure with everything Emily equals with all eight flavors so I tried with actually green tea salt and every single one of all the eight flavors went amazing it's so easy to make just a 5 TSP of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of matcha powder the green tea powder just mix it together tada current I saw right there is so good and especially on top of an avocado salad is delicious just your heart already the sprinkle is so good so yeah definitely tried the green tea soda at home just make a bunch of it and just skip it in the house and just you know you see that's regular salt I really like dipping my tofu just paint right off or just dipping the greatest sort so delicious so anyways yeah guys thank you so much for watching if you liked in my a flavor to some gifts out with this spread

tongue-tied for fired what was I said probably something foolish they didn't make my sandwich", "ZrUK7A5-byo": "hi everyone I just thought it come on live before our live video tonight cocktail time with Colorado martini I'm making the sweet and sour mix that we're going to be using tonight for the gummy bear martini and so I always make the second time and so I thought it'd be really fun to come on live and make a video on how I make this making your own sweet and sour is amazing it's great in martinis it's great in margaritas and it's so much better than store-bought and you have controlled the ingredients so you could use organic lemons and limes organic sugar whatever fits the bill in your life so I think you would enjoy it so this is just a quick online video on how to make the sweet and sour for the gummy bear routine that we'll be making at five-thirty Mountain Standard time tonight and tonight we're doing the the gummy bear martini we're doing our what we call our Colorado appletini and we're also doing drunken gummies and let's see what else are we doing Oh we're also talking about gigantic ice cubes which are so cool as a gift to like your boyfriend or father or whoever so I hope you join us tonight at 5:30 Mountain Standard Time and 7:30 Eastern Standard Time but in the meantime we are going to make some sweetened homemade sweet and sour mix for the gummy bear martini that we're doing tonight so um basically my recipe is for this martini we only need about an ounce for the martini itself for two martinis so I make a fourth book I could have 1/4 of a cup of sugar and 1/4 of a cup of lemon freshly squeezed lemon juice do not use the kind that comes out of the bottle it's just not that great and there's nothing like fresh squeezed and if you're able to get Meyers lemons get minor's lemons because they make the best lemonade in the best drinks they are they are said to be a mix of a mandarin orange and a regular lemon so they have a very sweet taste to them and they almost have an orange hue but unfortunately I'm not able to get them this time of year they're usually in Colorado you can get them in the winter time but it varies where you are so if you go to the grocery and ask them for minors lemons they're usually not with the regular lemons they're usually kind of have their a little spot but if you love making lemonade or making drinks with fresh lemons get minors lemons they're wonderful so I just have regular lemons for the sweet and sour mix that's gonna be going into our gummybear martini tonight so um I have 1/4 of a cup of freshly squeezed lime juice and you do I always do in this type of juicer it makes really is so quick to do it with this type of juicers boom boom boom it's done and it's it's no big deal and it also strains it for you although I love pulp and you know lemon lime sweet and sour mix and it's even better when it's in a martini so I've already squeezed some lines we only need an ounce of limes and so a shot glass that's an ounce so I'm gonna pour it in see and this is the other neat thing about these juicers is that you can just pour right into your container so I'm just gonna throw that into the lemon juice and then I have 1/4 of a cup of water I love using mason jars they are wonderful not only are they great containers and you can seal it and throw it the refrigerator but they also have measurements on the sides so I like using 4 cloth a 4 cup which is one quart mason jar and um you always want to get the wide mouth ones because if you're putting like lemons straight in here or lime straight in here to soak like in your vodka or whatever you're making like if you're making like and you've got your simple surf that you make first thing to throw the lemons and then let them soak it makes great lemonade so the wide mouth is the best so have a fourth of a cup of water I'm putting in my fourth of a cup of lemon and an ounce of lime juice you don't want to turn a lime juice with limes overpower a lemonade or a line a or a simple syrup like we're making and now we're gonna put in 1/4 of a cup of sugar ok so we have 1/4 of a cup of water 1/4 of a cup of sugar 1/4 of a cup of freshly squeezed lemons and 1 ounce of lime juice so you can triple this recipe because you can see how much it's makes it doesn't make a ton because I'm just making this for the gummy bear martini that we're making tonight so you can definitely triple this you know quadruple it whatever if you're having a party again margaritas put some contrast in this and some tequila and some ice to die for so I know anything I like about the mason jars is you can just seal them up get my shake and I usually just come by and check it every so often so the sugar dissolves and boom you have sweet and sour for your drinks or your lemonade or whatever you're making margarita martinis whatever so tonight this will be for our gummybear martini will be going live making that at five-thirty Mountain Standard times 7:30 Eastern Standard Time and 4:30 Pacific Standard Time I guess it's daylight savings time actually we're also gonna be making drunken gummies those are great to take to a party like if you're going to a football game party or a poker party or whatever they're right to take its little tidbits to participate in like a potluck what else are we doing tonight we're also going to be making her out of tini our Colorado Apple Keeney and we are also going to be talking about ice cubes and why do you want to have large ice cubes in your drink and kind of the science behind it so I hope you could join us and always remember I always will put links down below in the description of this video or on my webpage to the recipes of whatever I'm making and also some of the products that we use in these recipes we do ask if you could use our links because it does help support our channel we are affiliated with Amazon and hopefully soon will be affiliated with some of the distilleries in the local area so we appreciate your support and any help that you can give us so for now we'll see you tonight see you later I was signing out Colorado martini and thank you for coming you all and love you", "YQbGj-rqdeI": "[Music] we're going to do a sweet potato recipe that we have seen on thanksgiving it's a sweet potato that we pack in a orange here's the oranges we'll stuff them in that and then we'll put a marshmallow on the top we bake our sweet potato and when you get it baked you just peel it i baked them i've already baked them so you wouldn't have to wait on that and uh if there's any dark places in it you need to take that out they have to bake about about 45 minutes on a 425 degree oven and what i would do is not get a great big potato and get all of them uh about the same size so they'll bake they'll be done at the same time so i use potatoes about that size and i'm gonna cut it this big chunks in this mixing bowl and we're gonna use the electric mixer to mix this stuff together the next thing we're gonna do is mix in a 14 ounce can of eagle brand milk everything good with eagle ran on it this is soft it's not melted but it'll be all right three tablespoons of melted butter two teaspoons of vanilla extract two teaspoons of orange zest now i like to use uh i have used all kind of zesting tools but this is one of the best ones i've used and i don't know where i got that i think down at the viking cooking school though when i went down there and it really works great i thought you might want to see that a fourth of a teaspoon of salt an eighth of a teaspoon of nutmeg we have an eighth a teaspoon of allspice with a teaspoon of cinnamon and that's about all till we get this mixed up we have to make people when it's cleaner it's already cooked so there's nothing in here you really have to cook so you do warm it up we're just going to stir this so it's real creamy it's looking pretty good we have our potatoes now and we're going to just spoon a half a cup what we're going to do is put these back in the oven for about uh i think 20 minutes and then we take them out and we put marshmallows on top and you know marshmallows is great with sweet potatoes we're going to put these in the oven for 20 minutes on the 350 degrees we're going to put these back in the oven in a 350 degree oven they cook about another 15 minutes just enough the marshmallows melt okay we have uh finished our sweet potato orange cups it's good it's i hope you enjoy it i hope you cook it and enjoy as much as we do and i'll see you on our next family video thank you for watching you", "fFle734qn3c": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hello mega love shout out everyone and happy new year everybody hope everyone is doing great and um in this video guys i will show you how to make my cream cheese plan or another way is we call it leche plant but in my version of making my cream cheese plant is of course we will have to uh we will have to add a cream cheese there you go so this is what we will need for my cream cheese plants or the other version of making the lecture plan is this version guys you will use this cream cheese okay this is an eight ounce cream cheese uh that we will uh created to my plan that's your plan okay so we will need a course eggs this is eggs so i will need in this recipe guys you will need five eggs all right five eggs one cream cheese is eight ounce if you can all see it it's eight ounce pack of cream cheese and we will need a carnation above milk evaporated milk guys one can of this one kind of condensed milk and vanilla and of course what you will need to use to to to bake or to steam your lecture plan or your cream cheese plant you will need uh this kind of plant or make it whatever you know with whatever fan do you have for baking so but i'm making mine on this kind so this is from philippines i bought it last two years ago so when i uh i make my electric plan i have this thing okay so we use this on shaping the the plan okay the lecture plan or what i call it cream cheese so that's what we will need for this cream cheese plum yummy yummy yummy all right guys so i will take you on how i will uh create and make my cream cheese plan if you can't see if you can all see guys on my background that is my window this is the window you'll see uh we have a snow last night there you go if you all see it it's all white outside because of the snow all right guys see let me show you guys outside how is it look like it's all white guys so it's all white outside because of the snow you see oh you see all that one you see it see all white covered with the snow there you go and here i [Music] more am [Music] [Music] this [Music] cream cheese [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] together [Music] do [Music] so let's go

everyone [Music]", "KtA3gpvl3Cs": "hello this is a wise guys yes I shouldn't talk about dilution calculation pathway what is dilution that oh she means are more solvent is added and the solute remains the same as a result because solute to remain same and more cemente add it so the water of solution gets more so that's why the concentration of the solution becomes wrong right how do we say the concentration the concentration C you call the amount of solute divided amount of solution by a multi hundred percent right when this one you add most event the solute solution equals the solution you cause solute press so met when at the most event so root to stay sane so the solution the volume of solution gets more but salutis to stay sane so in this situation this is the fraction when numerator stays stay same and the denominator gets greater so the fraction gets smaller so that's why the concentration gets smaller so let's look at example and question one using a dilution procedure looking for how many milliliters of 15% master volume sodium chloride solution I needed to make 1,500 milliliter of 0.9% sodium chloride solution so when you do a question about the dilution you always make clear solute doesn't change so we're looking for how many solute so because the amount of solute in both solution 1 is concentrated solution the other is diluted solution stay safe so let's look at this one how many milliliter 50% of this well I needed to make 1,500 middle of 0.9% solution so from 15% to 0.9% the solution is diluted so 0.9% is 0.9% means there are zero point nine grams of solute in 100 milliliters of solution right that's percent because zero point nine over 100 zero point nine grams solute over 100 milliliter of source now we make 1,500 milliliters solution that's why we can set the ratio zero point nine grams over hundred milliliter equals we need fifteen hundred million so this is a how many how much salute so we can find X equals because both side we can zero cancel zero cancel so X multiplier one you called fifteen one five zero point nine we got fifteen times 0.9 the unit because we're looking for X when milliliter middle either cancel out the answer will be got their grams so 15 times this is the X cat is a one point five times nine is thirteen point five grams so we need the thirteen point five we have thirteen point five grams of salt and the 13.5 thirteen point five grams of solute it from concentrated so then we write the solution that's why we looking for the volume from fifteen percent we can say fifteen percent means 15 grams in each unit either this is a high concentration this is the low concentration so 15 grams in hundred milliliter now we have we needed 13 point 5 gram is how many milliliters solution right so in this situation first you need focus on how many how much solute after find the number of solute because solute stay say so then you go to the console how how many you need so in this situation we can calculate x equals you cross multiply she cross multiplication and then x times 15 and 15 on the bottom and 100 times thirteen point five which is 13.5 multiply hungry right then we got x equals the top is one three five zero divided the 15 then we can use calculate to find the answer so during the calculation every time you need the folks on the solute it doesn't change right so we have 1350 divided the 15 you call it 90 so this is a 90 minute even because this one is grams gram cancel out so actually call me really so X because ninety milliliters so we need 90 million liters of 15 percent and the sodium chloride the solution and to make a fifteen hundred milliliter of 0.9% solution this is the question one question to how much cement in milliliters should be added to five milliliters of a 50.0 milligram per milliliter antibiotic solution to decrease the concentration to one percent this question is looking for so vent because cement press the root because solution in dilution situation so rule to never change just add more cement so that's why we still for are looking for how much salute now the information they say how much cement in the region should be added to five milliliter of 50 milligrams per milliliter antibiotic solution let's make a picture this one because in for example in a graduated major and you have I say you have five milliliter this is a five million five milliliter solution which is 50 milligram per minute this is a 50 milligram per milliliter concentration right this way and now we need to decrease the concentration to one percent so that means you need to add them most select so at the most event becomes two less concentration right become a less concentration now this is still five this is still five maybe leader this is right and this way the final volume solution we don't know we're looking for and then the solute is stained saying so that's why we need a first using these two information to find the number of solute so the number of solute is we can say 55 milliliter multiplied 50 milligrams per milliliter so we have milliliter middle it'll cancel out with 250 milligrams absolute so this is inside is 250 meter 250 milligrams of solute and even after dilute I rotate still 250 milligrams but distribute in more select so now you can say the final concentration because you still have 250 milligrams but you have more so when you have more volume of solution and become the Constituent become one percent the one percent means one gram in 100 milliliter so now you can see how much this one we don't know so this is the X right it's an X leader todos Russia and the solute is tasting so it 250 milligrams so you can write X milliliter to 50 milligram but the milligrams and the grams is not matching unit so we need convert the same unit from grams to milligrams but I solid so one grams you can't win solvent milligrams so then you can see we're working with these two this part what sorry this one should be when gram to install the meter when the ball you stay 100 right 400 see 100 and this is a 250 we're looking for so then you can see these two zero zero kinds of out right then we look at the dis one obviously cross multiplication we can say the milligrams is x equals you cross my 3k Sheen you got 250 and what PI 1 you cause 100 we got the 25 made it easy so this is 25 this is X you call 25 milliliter the final solution is 25 minute ago so we're looking for servant obvious you can see before you have 5 milliliter now you need the 25 milliliter so the solution servant equals so so when T equals 25 minus 5 and this is a milliliter you call tiny milliliter this one is the milliliters of cement okay this is presented by y sky thank you", "dlcaKsEe17M": "hey there i've got 45 minutes until the uh to the sun sets down and i gotta mow the lawn fertilize the lawn and seed it let's do it well guys welcome back to my yard it's been quite a while since you guys have seen it and uh let's just say we've had a good season i just haven't showed you guys much of the lawn um today we're gonna fertilize it get some some grass seed down talk about a couple things and uh we have no time to waste because as i said there's not much daylight left so today here's what the lawn's looking like and uh what we're gonna go ahead and do is overseed with the gci turf cool blue grass seed it's this new blend of turf type tall fescue and uh kentucky bluegrass and we're gonna go ahead and oversee that as well as apply some of the next green pop 1621.2 that's going to be our starter fertilizer as well as probably some rgs humic 12 and airaid we're going to go ahead and do that today get this lawn back into shape well it does look good there's just some areas that have struggled over winter i.e right here as you can see it's just i don't know what happened just then so we're gonna get it back into shape i'm gonna actually go show you guys the seed talk about that for a quick minute i'm not gonna bore you with every other mother and their brother showing you content on how to overseed your lawn so i'm just kind of gonna quickly do this and not bore you with content so let's check out that seed real quick [Music] here's what we're dealing with guys we got some thor tall fescue blacktail tall fescue falcon ib tall fescue blue coat bluegrass and uh zero point zero percent other crop seeds one point six percent inner matter and zero point zero percent weed seed that means it's a good seed no weed seed that means that everything that's going to germinate in here is either grass or grass so we're going to go ahead and throw some of this stuff down uh big thanks to mr pete dunny with gci turf for sending over a 25 pound bag of his wonderful seed and uh we're going to oversee this long here um actually i need to actually mow it first so instead of boring you with mowing footage ready one two three nice and mode [Music] so the first thing you want to do is you want to cut your lawn lower then you want to aerate or liquid aerate i'm not going to share my opinion on it because i don't want the hate in the comments do what pleases you aerate it or liquid aerate it it doesn't matter do it your way i'm not sharing my way i'm sure you already know my way i'm not sharing because i don't want the hate in the comments aerated or liquid aerated it's up to you honestly then mow it down short the next step is going to be seed right now we're going to apply the seed we're going to do 5 pounds per thousand on my yard my yard's pretty thick we're just filling in some bare spots so five pounds per thousand times three thousand square feet we need 15 pounds of grass seed do you really think i'm going to get a scale out and measure 15 pounds no i'm going to pour about half this bag of grass seed into the spreader and spread it down right on the yard we're supposed to have fun here not be so particular so let's go have some fun look at that sunset though all right guys so it has gotten dark out but i'm going to go ahead and apply this with a little head lamp on just because i need to get this down as you can see 16 nitrogen 21 phosphorous 2 potassium applied a rate of 15 ounces per thousand for warm season and 15 ounces for cool season i'm actually deficient in nitrogen so i'm going to do this rate 15 ounces per thousand every one to two weeks with this product and uh get her down just to kind of get this seed going so great product here from my friends over at green county fertilizer we're gonna get this down right now with my head lamp on and uh there's gonna be no looking back on this product as well as some rgs airy and i think some humic 12. go ahead and mix it up in backpack sprayer as well as right here i have some propaconazole so i'm going to throw that down for fungus since we're going to be watering quite a bit so we'll go ahead and since it's dark i won't show you guys any of the process you know what it looks like but i got a backpack sprayer right back here fill it up three gallons of water get the one that's right there spray it actually i don't know if you can see it but the sky yeah you can't but because the clouds are right there but the sky looks super super cool but uh we're gonna go ahead and get that down and uh then uh i don't know because i'm thinking here this is completely raw um i'm thinking that depending on how much content i get out i may be able to show you guys results of the yard um as we finish up because i may not even have the video out yet so we'll see how this video turns out right now the date is september 5th i'm actually getting to the aeration seating's a little bit late um actually mine i did all mine last week in september but uh my personal one i'm getting to a little bit late so i guess we'll go ahead and get this mixed up and without further ado we'll get spraying what's going on guys so i just want to go ahead and walk you through a few last things you want to consider when seating so first you want to go to greencastsoiltemperatures.com that's going to be a website that you can plug in your zip code or your town and find out what exactly your exact soil temperature is you want to seed when the temperature is just below 70 degrees but no less than 60 degrees so between 60 and 70 and you're golden to seed you also want to check your 14 day forecast make sure you're not seeing any night temperatures in freezing obviously make sure all that looks good so that way you're not going to see the seed freeze or anything crazy like that also on top of that you want to make sure you're watering consistently without consistent water that seed is not going to germinate you want to make sure the soil that you're seeding in stays moist so for some people that might be watering two times a day for others that might be watering three times a day for me i recommend going ahead and watering early in the morning around six or seven o'clock in the morning and once again around three or four o'clock in the afternoon if you need to add in an additional one if you decide to seed early because you're trying to do a full renovation or something like that then you might want to water three or four times a day and maybe even substitute in some manual watering those are all things you may want to consider when seeding but other than that a typical over seeding probably only needs water for about two weeks every single day twice a day then you can back off to once a day and then back off to your normal watering before you go into your freezing temps to slow down that's really as simple as it is don't over complicate it just follow these simple steps and you will be gold into overseeding my lawn looks absolutely great now i actually have some pictures because it got dark and i need to get this video done so i will roll those pictures at the end but if you have any other questions about this process please leave them in the box down below but with that i'm aiming for maison landscaping thank you for watching hope you guys enjoyed and i'll see you on the next one peace you", "noQGg_t5eYY": "what's going on everyone we're at the range today we're going to do some penetration tests with three different types of home defense annal birdshot buckshot and a slug and what we're basically going to show is that I think birdshot is the best because it's not going to over penetrate but whatever gets it is going to get destroyed anyway but some people think that buckshot and slugs are better so they more lethal but they're going to over penetrate and possibly go through a wall or through a door so we've set up a mock scenario here's an inside panel door it's a hollow door pretty good pretty typical scenario you're going to be in a corridor we're going to shoot the target the watermelon here that's going to be center mass just flesh and body whatever it's going to get destroyed we're going to see if it's going to go through the target and hit a watermelon on the other side we're going to be using the Remington 870 optical with an 18 and 1/2 inch barrel first up is challenger number seven and a half birdshot here we go you Oh messy alright so as you guys can see the watermelon or your intruder he's totally destroyed but if you take a close look at the door not a single pellet actually even touch the door and auntie or granny sleeping on the next side and the other room she's perfectly fine no damage so that's a success let's move on to the next test buckshot alright so for the second test we're going to be using Remington 2 and 3/4 buckshot this is extremely high velocity see how that goes you awesome alright so that was the second shot with the Buckshot completely different story the target is equally destroyed there's really no noticeable difference there but if you take a closer look it completely went through the watermelon or your intruder completely went through this hollow panel door I see light on the other side so ooh that's bad granny sleeping she's not waking up from that one so look here oh yeah completely Oh completely destroyed all right so we're on to the third test we're going to use high brass high velocity two and three-quarter inch one ounce slug you take it right holy [ __ ] any telling exploded better than the line alright so that was the slug and as you can see it was the most devastating by far you could tell by the footage so your intruder is completely destroyed but it went clean through the watermelon clean through the door and we got the other watermelon here granny would not have liked that very much let's crack her open see if we can find that slug a hole like that Wow pieces of the door there's peace of wadding alright so in conclusion so as I suspected I personally think that birdshot is really the best for home defense simply because it's not going to over penetrate go through walls go through doors and possibly hurt or kill somebody in the next room but the target or the intruder is still going to be completely destroyed buckshot it penetrates goes through the door goes to the wall no problem and the slug is even worse so I hope you guys learn something maybe that will change how you feel about home defense or what you're going to use leave your comments let me know what you think after watching this you", "8UJuMTKzjAw": "thank you for your purchase we

to be making a reverse chocolate eclair cake you heard that right usually you use vanilla pudding mix and chocolate icing but as you can see we've reversed that today because it's real close to christmas and you can't find that vanilla instant jello mixture so look we've done reverse before i like it just as good one way or the other and you will too now look pound for pound this is the easiest dessert you can make and you get the most reward for the effort everybody will love this dessert you will always be requested to make it at family gatherings it won't take hardly any time so let's get right to it first of all as you can see here i've already cut up some graham crackers to put on the bottom the next thing we're going to do is make the pudding so let me show you how easy that is right now so once you got the first layer of graham crackers in the pan next you want to put the two large boxes of pudding mix in the bowl and three and a half cups of cold whole milk beat it with a wire whisk until it gets thick next thing we're going to do is put a whole 8 ounce tub of cool whip right into it and you just mix it up real good with a wire whisk i'll be honest you can use electric hand mixer if you want to or even a stand mixer but i just decided to use a wire whisk this time you're going to put about half of the mixture on top of the graham crackers and spread it out and once you get it spread out put in another layer of graham crackers now i always try to trim mine around the edges and i get a lot of grief around here for doing a real neat job but i can't help it that's just the way i do it okay once you get the second layer of graham crackers in there you just put the rest of the chocolate in now be sure and get out as much as you can you don't want to waste one bit of that good stuff spread it out even try to get it really level and then put in your final layer of graham crackers now this is real simple all we're going to do is put this in the microwave oven and melt it now this is the final part right here you just put it in the microwave oven for 30 seconds take it out see how thin it is and then put it back in for 10 seconds and check it again and just do it about 10 seconds at a time until you get it like you want it which is about like that this is easy there'll be plenty to cover up every single graham cracker just pour it out let it spread out now what we're going to do is put the lid on this put it in the refrigerator and let it sit overnight you always want to make this today before you want to eat it and that's so those graham crackers can get nice and soft just the way you like them i'll see you tomorrow well it's been 24 hours and here's the reverse chocolate declare cake so we're gonna give it a try just going to cut a piece out right here look at that all right here we go i'm telling you that's some good stuff and for the effort versus the reward it's one of the best desserts you can make remember what i said everybody's gonna want it they're gonna wait at all they're gonna ask you to do it year after year so don't forget the chocolate declare cake or in this case the reverse chocolate eclair cake if you like what we're doing subscribe to my channel mash that notification bell so you know every time i put out a video and i'll see you next time on the southern cyborg cooks", "Ym9d6TgVWMA": "hi there everyone its Laurel beard\nwelcome to another video today I've got seven ways to use gelatos for you I love\nthe faber castell gelatos I have an entire playlist full of old videos I'm\nlinking to right here for you the first technique I want to show you is the\ndripping technique before I get started I just wanted to point out that all of\nthe cardstock panels that I'm using today has been primed with white gesso\nthere's a lot of different jess's on the market some can be bought in retail\nstores like Michaels and Hobby Lobby also available online I'll link to a few\nin the YouTube description but gelada I mean when you're using gelatos you\nreally want to take that extra step and prime your cardstock because it creates\na blendable smooth surface for your gelatos if you've use them and you find\nthat you're not getting a blending you need to prime your cardstock with just\nso it just takes a few extra seconds and it's definitely worth it I'm using\ndifferent colored gelatos here on the first the top part of my first card\npanel here and then I'm going to take my fingers and geladas wrapped to moisture\nand that includes the oils and your fingers my fingers were especially dry\nthat day so I just sprayed a little bit of water and I'm dipping my finger into\nthe water and then just kind of rubbing around a little bit on the top panel of\nthe geladas just to get them moving this is some regular water\nI am spritzing down in a vertical motion to create those drip looks and that's\ngonna be this card you can keep piling on colors of gelada to create very\nvibrant drip techniques if you want to but I just wanted to keep everything\nsoft and pretty so here's my card I just ran a fun little heart scribbly die cut\nthrough the the panel here and kind of left the card is--is cuz I love the\ndrippy look I think it's so cute moving on to the second technique with\nthe geladas we're gonna do some stenciling so here again all of my card\nstock is prime with gesso already I'm just scribbling on just various colors\nof gelato and looks pretty ugly right now now Here I am trying to blend it\nit's not wet so I wanted to show that in the video that if that's what's\nhappening if you're using gelatos and it's not blending a your panel is at\nprime with gesso and B you need to use something moist to really get it moving\nand you can see how beautifully it blended with very little effort once I\nmade sure that my little rag I was using hat was wet the\na stencil from Heaphy doodle and I'm going to take it kind of hold it in\nplace and then Here I am just going over some\nof the color with a yellow gelada to create a pretty Sun right here\nthe gelatos when they dry they are completely permanent they do take a long\ntime to dry completely so I just make it a point that anytime I am using geladas\nto go ahead and spray a fixative spray over the top I just use a matte fixative\nspray I'll link to it in the description if you're interested just to make sure\neverything is locked in and here's that look and you can see that I was able to\nlayer gelato on top of gelato and got a really pretty dimensional look here so\nyou know you can pile you can layer or layer it on I say and here I just\nfinished off with this little superhero girl here you can also do a mana print\nfrom what's left on your stencil so don't wash that stencil off I'm going to\ntake the stencil with all the gelatos still on there spray it with some water\nflip it over and stamp basically and that's pretty much all there is to it so\nthe gelato will transfer nicely onto your panel and get a great mono print\nlook and check this out I just did a sentiment stamp right over the top of\nthat done and done now let's do a stencil resist which I think this is\ncool I just love this and I'm going to tell you right now this is probably my\nfavorite card out of all of them and it took very little effort and I didn't\neven stamp on it or add any sentiments because I didn't want to mess it up I\njust thought it was so pretty so I'm using two different shades of purple\nhere one is actually a metallic and you might not be able to tell as it's going\ndown but you'll see in just a minute so first I'm just blending on this purple\nand you can almost kind of see the metallic kind of showing up to the\ndarker spots and I'm just blending it on that rag is so well loved and I tell you\nI keep a garbage can off to the side and I just fill it with rags and when it's\nfull I just washed them this is pink I decided to go ahead and just smear that\naround there anyway it doesn't look pretty like that but that's okay cuz\nwatch what's gonna happen I'm taking a clean area of that rack and I'm just\nprying some firm pressure I did not add any water or anything to it and I'm\nbasically lifting the gelatos right through that stencil so that's why I\ncall it stencil lifting so I'm just lifting that color\nright up and you see that now if you really want to get in there and get a\ngood good good a lift you can add a little bit of water to your to your rag\nwhich is what I did and Here I am really applying the pressure and you can see\nit's almost white there and then I added a little touch of pink right through the\ncenter and I'm just again kind of lifting and go look at that can we just\nstop and look at that I wish I kind of did a freeze-frame right here but let's\njust look at this this is so pretty I did nothing else to this card whatsoever\nexcept adhere it to a card base I didn't even want to put a sentiment on it I\ndidn't want to put an image on it I didn't do anything I just think it's so\npretty and that's just from a couple colors of gelatos and a stencil you know\nyou could also take a stencil and go over very light handed to lift it and\nthen shift it over a little bit to the left or right and then go over it again\nand lift it get a whole totally different look and I should have done\nthat oh why didn't I do that you guys but anyway this is really pretty I can't\ngo back and add a very simple simple sentiment if I want to but for now I'm\njust leaving that baby alone because I think it's beautiful let's move on to\nthe next technique which is acrylic blocks or acrylic block painting to be\nexact this is a block from Katherine puller I'm going in with rainbow order I\nneed to get over my rainbow self but I'm just rolling with it and I'm scribbling\non the gelatos straight onto this block and I'm actually going to get two two\nstamps if you will or paints or what up paintings or whatever prints you want to\ncall it out of this so once I get all the colors on there I'm gonna miss it\nwith some water you can also mist it with some perfect pearls or something\nlike that to get some added shine you don't always have to use water they do\nreact to any kind of moisture and then I'm just stamping down I'm pressing hard\nand I'm lifting up and then I'm gonna get kind of this look now it's gonna\ncreate little puddles as you see here so I'm kind of moving that around to get a\nlittle bit of a drip technique but I'm keeping everything in the rectangle now\nthe second one I'm just gonna add a little bit of water to reactivate I'm\ngonna press down and do a little jig II see that little chick and I set this all\naside to dry now you can use a heat tool if you wanted to but I didn't here's the\nlook at the first one where we just add a lot of water and press straight down\nand here's the second one I think I like this one better with a little jig is you\nkojiki action let's move on to tinting pastes any kind of pace\nembossing paste texture paste even gels mediums glues whatever you content with\nthe gelatos so here I'm taking some white embossing paste and I am working\noff of my tempered glass mat here if you don't have this a plastic plate a glass\nplate packaging from your stamp set anything slippery that's easy to clean\nup you can use and whatever color do you want to use and you're just basically\ncreating your own custom colors so they're added a couple of colors of pink\nand I'm mixing it together using these new media spatulas from tonic I have a\ntwo-minute tip video I'm going to put it up right here in case you want to check\nit out a lot of people were like can't you just use a kitchen spatula well you\ncan but these are made for paper crafters these are small they have a\ngreat handle they have the design to get into small intricate places on your\nstencil I just you know prefer these over my kitchen spatulas but anyway that\nwas one of the common questions can't use a kitchen spatula sure if you want\nto but I like these better these were designed specifically for crafters and\nyou're about to see them in action here but I also have a video I'm linking\nabove right here in the corner alright so now that I've made these custom\ncolors here by just mixing the pace now you can actually make custom gelato\ncolors by adding different gelatos and then mixing them together and then\nadding the paste if you want to but here you can see I'm going in and because\nthese are silicone I'm able to really get in that stencil this is an intricate\nstencil with lots and lots and lots of space here to get into so I just love\nthese things I just I dig them and I'm going back and forth I mean out you can\nsee I'm going all over the place but when you lift this up the dimension\nthat is left from doing this through this stencil the custom colors that\nwe've created here by mixing the paste with these color gelatos are just\nabsolutely stunning I mean just look at this I I love these\ncolors I just love I never thought I was gonna like pink and yellow together but\num I love it and I just added a sentiment strip there now though the you\nlet me tell you how I did that I wish I wish I kept filming so I die cut that\nfrom black cardstock I applied a heavy application of the nouveau aqua flow\nglitter and then after that I added some tonic crystal glaze and I tell you\nthat's gorgeous gorgeous and gorgeous so anyway here's a look at this card and I\ndo love it the last and final technique I wanted to show you is direct stamping\nwith the gelatos to do direct stamping with gelatos it's really good to get a\nstamp that has a lot of detail in it you don't want a stamp that has a lot of\nopen spaces so I chose this stamp set again everything I'm using is link below\nin the description but this is the sketchy flower stamp set from the stamp\nmarket I am using my Misti stamping tool it's just easier for placement then you\ncan take the gelatos and directly scribble onto your stamps this is not\ngoing to ruin your stamp in any way you can run it under some water to get all\nof the gelato off if you're got some intricate areas in here and since this\nis a very detailed stamp I did end up having to run it under the faucet but it\nwas no big deal so once I applied the gelato onto the stamp I spritzed it with\nwater because remember gelatos are water reactive and I'm giving it a good press\nthere because I want to make sure that all the gelato transfers to the paper\nbecause geladas are very pitted me put a little pigmented sticks but they're\nthicker than water colors so here I'm going in and adding a couple different\nflowers to the center a couple different colors to the center of the flowers just\nto add a little bit more fun and then I'm gonna go ahead and wipe this off as\nbest I can and then like I said I did finish cleaning it off in the sink under\nsome cold water so I went ahead and did the same thing with these stems scribble\ndirect to the stamp add a little bit of water and then press with them and again\nyou can really get some fun looks very very watercolor we're very artsy looks\nby mixing and matching your colors and I love how this turned out I have to say\nto create a little glow around the edge of my card panel I am just adding the\ngelato directly to the edge and then I'm gonna blend a little bit of it out with\nmy finger now a little bits gonna get you see how there's this little red blob\ndown there at the bottom it's like earth but that's because it's not dry so these\nare gonna react to moisture so you want to be careful when you're doing\ndifferent applications and working in different areas kind of work areas that\naren't necessarily side by side to each other so you don't get little blobs like\nI did here but it's okay I'm gonna fix it\nbut just keep that in mind when you're working with gelatos I love these guys I\njust think they're really fun and they're calorie free this is a white\ngelato and here I am going in and adding some white but it almost makes it look\naged if you will by doing this because it's I don't know I just it really I\ndidn't think it was gonna make that much of a difference because it's white but\nit really took the card to a different little level and just made it more aged\nand I don't know antiquey if you will and I'm gonna go ahead and stamp a\nsentiment here now definitely use the stamping tool or stamp positioner when\nyou're stamping over the gelato is because the gelatos are you know thick\nand texture tea you might not get a perfect impression so also keep that in\nmind if you're doing any stamping over the gelatos I used my Misti for all of\nthe sentiments and had I not I would have been up the creek you know what I'm\nsaying so there you have it seven ways to use the faber castell gelatos I hope\nyou enjoyed today's video if you did be sure to hit that thumbs up and subscribe\nif you're not already and click that notification bell so you can be notified\nevery time I upload thank you guys so much for watching if there's any\nspecific technique you want to see used in the gelatos do let me know in the\ncomments and I'll be happy to try it out make a video again thanks for watching\nand I'll see you next time", "yqrTa5Alazo": "hi everyone let's mix some egg rolls today [Music] first put four ends of ground pork in a bowl then add 40 grams of glass noodle 15 grams of carrot strips and 10 grams of finely chopped wood ear mushrooms and mix it well together now you want to marinate the filling with one teaspoon of sugar half a teaspoon of cornstarch 1/4 of a teaspoon of black pepper and one and 1/2 teaspoon off your sauce mix it well and let it marinate for about half an hour before using it [Music] to make the egg rolls I dip the mini rice paper in some cold water and that it soften then put about 1 tbsp of filling at one end off the rice paper shape it a little longer take the ash roll it over once fold the ends inside and finish rolling it all the way through and the ends will stick together finish making the rest of the egg rolls make sure you don't put them close to each other because they will stick together [Music] in a pot heat up about two cups of oil to 400 degrees put the egg rolls in and cook them for about five minutes until they're golden brown once it's golden brown take it out and put it on some paper towel to soak up the oil and it's ready to be served hope you

wait uh why are you yelling aren't you the imposter oh yeah [Music] all right that's it let's go back to playing fall guys what no just give this game a chance i just think this game would be a lot better if i knew the killers were from the start it was more about running away from the imposters than about solving a mystery there could be obstacles and booby traps to stop the runners oh and when you cross the finish line you're safe forever and you move on to the next round actually you could probably just get rid of the imposters all together and make it more like a series of challenges that'll eliminate more and more people until there's one ultimate victor okay you literally just described fall guys exactly ah what's a charming specimen who you calling a specimen pal hey the gentleman who's your new friend this here is my associate mr egg hello there fellas mr egg here so nice to meet any acquaintances of the gentleman okay are we seriously gonna glance over the fact that he called me a specimen what happened to mr cheese wow mr cheese and i came to a mutual agreement to terminate our partnership i'm sorry to hear that the gentleman yeah sounds like you got dumped not surprised you have horrible fashion sense why i never what could possibly lead you to make such a preposterous accusation dude you're wearing two top hats that's insane it is a little weird the gentleman but double the top hat double the fancy hey show some respect to the gentleman he's an among us legend yes i've literally never seen him win yeah me neither veteran you've only played one game yeah and the gentleman didn't win it why are we arguing about this good sirs i'll have you know that i am an excellent among us competitor and i take insult to your quips about my skill top-notch comeback sir prove it then and beat veteran and i in the next round perhaps i shall or perhaps you shall not [Music] are you crewmate or imposter crewmate but even if i was the imposter i wouldn't tell you that then i suppose i have no choice but to believe you wait how do i know that you're not the imposter i swear on all that is fall guys i am a true blue american crewmate all right you're clean where's your first task med bay me too wait hang on veteran there's people inside quiet mr egg we don't want to be seen by any crewmates and what do i do with the bodies the gentlemen well nothing technically the game doesn't allow you to move them in any way oh brilliant observation sir oh my god the gentleman and mr egg are the two imposters what's our plan their cooldown counters can't possibly be used up already i'm just gonna run in there and report them yeah we're literally eyewitnesses they gotta believe you sorry player i don't believe you what but veteran i saw him we know that they're the imposters yeah and nothing on earth will convince me otherwise but i didn't do it oh really oh sorry man i could have sworn i saw you in there with the dead bodies veteran he's lying dang he's good i can vouch for the gentleman he's definitely a crew mate hmm i'm not sure who i can trust what do you think about all this poindexter it's a engineer and according to my calculations there's a 12.5 probability it's the gentleman thanks nerdman how you liking those odds poopyfarts wise input as always poopyfarts i move that we skipped this vote i suppose that sounds reasonable all those in favor of skipping the vote say aye aye oh wait no i got confused again so you have a task in here right sure do all right go finish it while i keep watch hang on this rock's got a leaf pattern on it oh boy this is turning out to be a real doozy hurry up veteran the coast is still clear but the gentleman of mr a could be anywhere veteran veteran is no longer with us i'm afraid what the gentleman how did you the van's dear boy an imposter's greatest asset you're gonna pay for this the gentleman i'm gonna convince everyone i'm still not convinced everyone i mean on one hand it could be the gentleman but on the other hand it could not be the gentleman i think you see my dilemma well now that there's only six of us voting someone else makes a lot of sense mathematically for the crewmates whoa he's up on the science mumbo jumbo albert brainstein i think he'll beat einstein yeah i'm pretty sure they didn't name the smartest man in the world after his eyes guys listen to me the gentleman is working with mr egg if we don't vote him out now his reign of terror will continue i say we vote out mr player excellent idea the gentleman booby farts what say you nice a little outside the box maybe but i like your style booby farts proposes we vote out the geek are you talking about me why booby farts got a gut feeling and he's not just talking about the extra spicy burrito grande he had for lunch all those in favor say aye aye then the vote passes sorry engineer looks like your chances of survival are now 0.0000 [Music] percent all right player there may be something to your theory after all [Music] okay i just have to finish a couple more tasks same brother oh yeah i know right i'm totally a ghost now pretty sweet makes it way easier to do tasks when you don't have the looming fear of getting murdered hanging over you speaking of tasks let's do the measure weather one together it's real simple you just click the begin button ah i don't follow run for a player i'll hold him off he got past me player [Music] mr egg it's mr egg i was running for my life from him no it wasn't i was running away from player hmm well players shouted first so i'm more inclined to believe him what are you thinking poopyfarts i don't think so i highly doubt they'd have access to that kind of technology really in the next 20 years you say that's going to dramatically affect my lifestyle when that comes out what are you guys even talking about can we focus on the game here i've been telling you every round that it's the gentleman of mr egg and if we don't vote one of them out now we'll lose how do you figure the game ends when there's as many imposters as there are crewmates if you vote me out now and i'm not an imposter it becomes 2v2 and the imposters win really sounds like we shouldn't vote you out then yes but the same situation applies if you vote for mr egg and he turns out not to be the impostor dratz back to square one okay listen captain poopy farts i know i don't have any hard evidence but i want you all to look into your hearts hear the sincerity in my voice nobody wants to win this game more badly than me but this is bigger than that this is about justice this is about holding those imposters who eliminated our friends responsible for their crimes this is for all the crewmates that have fallen in the line of duty so please please believe me that was beautiful playing no i'm not crying you're crying your speech has moved me too let's do the right thing together really yes really all those in favor voting out mr player say aye aye oh wait dang he tricked us so long mr player all right tommy switched to another lobby [Music] uh you", "l0Umw8g7cQo": "[Music] what's going on guys today we're at the ranch this is our property we have them South Colorado Springs we live in our trailers kick it great views great place to grow pot smoke down all right guys this is the press we are going to be working with today it is a 12-ton rosin press [Music] you can go air compressed or there's a manual option we're gonna go with the manual route today just because we don't want to mess with the air compressor we haven't ran it in a while so we're gonna go with the manual group so we're gonna power it up here it's a little bit difficult to see but we're gonna go ahead and set our temperature [Music] we're gonna be running it at 222 degrees Fahrenheit for this press and we're gonna go ahead and set both our plates that temperature as you can see then we're gonna wait for this bad boy to heat up and we're gonna go press some weed these presses usually run about $1,500 but we actually got quite a good deal and got it for a trade for a pound of weed so usually around 1500 got a fair economy all right everybody here is the weed that we're gonna be pressing in to rosin this is some of our homegrown wheat it is actually four different strains we got some granddaddy purp elephant [ __ ] and EOG tangerine Kush we're gonna try to get about 10 grams of our bud into this puck press and this is what we're gonna be using to press down our weed we're gonna grind up our weed and fill this up and once this is all the way fill you [ __ ] give it a twist and that will tighten it and you put this lid on you screw the lid on and I'll compact all the weed into one nice little puck for the press [Music] alright guys so now that you've seen how that process works we're just gonna fill up and grind up a bunch more weed and we'll see you when that puck pressure's filled up we forgot our big grinders so [Music] alright guys so we're just gonna screw on the lid here and now we're gonna press all the way down into a nice compact puck [Music] dance seven point six minutes all right guys we want to get to ten grams for this press so we're gonna go ahead and put the puck back in and repress the weed to try to get to ten grams [Music] alright everyone here is our new puck [Music] alright guys so the total weight of our puck is 13.8 grams so we're about three point eight over but we wanted but that's alright half an ounce you can see right up here is where we're going our we'd it's a pretty nice setup we'll show you inside in a different video all right we're looking to upgrade that right now so we'll show you the full loop setup when it's all finished we're about there on both of them it's hard to see but both are about two twenty two so we're gonna get the puck in she's ready to go all right guys we're broke as [ __ ] we're using the nonstick just great value parchment paper it works great for this that's all you need we're gonna go ahead and get our two pieces ready [Music] though here is our half of an ounce puck and we're gonna go ahead and put it the press there it is pressing it 222 degrees for roughly in banana half paper good make sure it's centered so we just manually press it together and should get a decent yield from this all right guys we're gonna release it we're gonna take this inside and scrape it oh yeah we got some little dirt here that's right oh yeah [Music] your [ __ ] dabs we're gonna go ahead and take a few so I looks like a good size tab a today's video thanks for watching those are [ __ ] rosin fresh we're gonna take these dad's right now [Music] yeah", "CT-A_4YKjrU": "hello everyone my name is Hannah and I'm from Pro candle supply.com make sure you check out my website where you can get all of your candle making needs right in one place or check out one of our candle making kits if you're just getting started I've included the links in the description below today we're going to be talking about how much wax candle containers hold and how to find out how much wax your container will hold I get a lot of questions about the sizes of candle containers people seem to be getting confused by the liquid volume a container can hold versus how much wax by weight it can hold I'll explain how sizing works and how to apply it to candle making first and foremost there are a lot of containers out there many of them are designed to be used with more than just candle making most manufacturers of containers list the size based on the liquid volume that they hold this is not very helpful for us candle makers because we always formulate candles by weight and not by liquid volume and thus it's very confusing to someone who is just starting the containers on our website show the industry standard liquid volume as well as how much actual soy wax they will hold by weight for example the 8 ounce candle tin here holds 8 ounces of liquid volume but only 6 ounces of melted wax by weight this holds true for nearly any 8 ounce candle 10 you buy anywhere the 16 ounce candle tin holds 16 ounces of liquid volume and approximately 10 ounces of melted wax by weight the 16 ounce mason jar holds 16 ounces of liquid volume and approximately 12 ounces of melted wax by weight remember when making candles you always formulate them by weight not by volume it's extremely important that you always weigh out your fragrances and wax on a kitchen scale never use a liquid measuring device if you measure out 16 fluid ounces of fragrance oil or wax with a liquid measuring device it will not be the same amount as if you weigh out 16 ounces by weight of fragrance or wax on a scale here I have our 16 ounce mason jar it holds 16 ounces of water and it's sold a 16-ounce jar nearly everywhere you can buy it but when making a candle it will not hold 16 ounces of wax by weight let me demonstrate this for you what I'm about to show you is also a really good trick to find out how much wax any candle container will hold first you turn the scale on and make sure it's announces check check then you're going to put the jar onto the scale then go ahead and tear it out so the scale reads zero sorry there's a little bit of a glare on the scale so we tilted it a little bit now I should be able to see it so we have the scale it's on its announces we put the jar on we tear it it out and now we're at zero ounces so now you're gonna take your melted soy wax and you're gonna pour it into the jar until it hits the neck of the jar or until where you want to fill your candle to [Music] as you can see on the scale pouring to the neck of the jar gives me approximately 12 ounces by weight of soy wax this would be the perfect fill amount for my candle and now I know that I need 12 ounces of wax by weight each time I want to make this candle like I said before you can do this with any jar you have if you want to know how much wax it will hold by weight now that we have 12 ounces let me show you what would happen if I actually tried to put 16 ounces of wax by weight into this jar [Music] right at the top I don't want to keep pouring and make a huge mess but as you can see the candle jar is filled all the way to the tippy top and as you can see the candle wax weighs 15 ounces obviously you're not making candles like this because this one burned properly there's no room for the wick it's obviously not a correct candle so the jar doesn't hold 16 ounces of wax it only holds 12 ounces of wax to be a correct sized candle so moral of the story is this make sure you never make your candles based on liquid volume throw your liquid measuring devices into the cupboard and don't use them at all when you're making candles so I hope this helped clear up some confusion my wax is about to spill in my next video I'm going to show you how to find out how much wax and fragrance you need to make a specific number of candles I've definitely shown this in previous videos but I've decided I need to make a designated video just for this topic with some extra helpful tips and tricks so it's easy to find in view thanks so much for watching

America they often say that one beer is equal to one glass of wine which is also equal to one shot of hard alcohol but where did they come up with this equivalency between different types of alcohol the reason is the definition of a standard drink is 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol and each of these drinks actually contains that amount of alcohol we can verify this by looking at the alcohol percentage of each of the drinks and we'll also write down the standard serving size of each of these drinks when we multiply the alcohol percentage by the drink size we find that each of these drinks contains the standard point 6 fluid ounces of alcohol and this is great for theory but what happens in practice let's say you go to a bar and order a tall craft beer now very likely this tall craft beer may have 7% alcohol and a tall beer is often served in a 23 ounce glass so what you end up with is about 2.7 standard drinks similarly if you get a cocktail and someone serves you a strong cocktail you may end up with something which has a little bit higher alcohol percentage and it might have a little more alcohol than the standard serving and so you'll end up with more than just one standard drink you can even run into trouble with wine many wines in fact are not 12% but they are 15% and some one might serve you a little more than a standard serving size so even with wine you can end up with nearly double the amount of alcohol so if you want to keep track of this number of drinks you're having in a night you can follow this formula the number of standard drinks will be equal to the volume times the alcohol percentage divided by six the numerator tells you how much alcohol is in your drink and the denominator standardizes this - one drink equivalent you can often find the alcohol percentage just by looking at the label and looking for the ABV which is the alcohol by volume there are many websites and even smartphone apps that'll do this calculation for you but if you find this is all too much trouble you can save yourself the calculation the calories and the cash by choosing not to drink for the night I hope you like this video please subscribe to my channel I

beautiful card we'll be using gouache and watercolor and distress inks so i hope you'll grab your supplies and join me let's get started okay so i have here tim holtz distress specialty stamping paper i'm going to start with some gouache i have two colors and this is an artsy brand there are 24 colors in my palette and these are the two yellow you know the lightest yellow colors i have this i've been working so this is all this is gonna be a messy project you're gonna have a lot of cleanup and i don't really know what to tell you these are just the things that i use there are probably a myriad of other better or just different ideas you could use um i think the point is just to layer up you know and mix and match and get dirty until you're happy so i'm going to i tried distress crayon to start with i can show you it's kind of neat how it works so if you scribble you can blend with your finger but it seems that the water just took it away uh because i've been i added all kinds of things as i as i went along with my prototype and i'm going to try to remember everything that i did i don't even know how many cards i've made just messing around to see what would really work i've tried the mixed media paper and this actually i really like this paper it's very slick um very nice it's a coated paper all right so you know if you i don't want to do it today because i don't this is only yellow that i have other than an olive yellow but you can color and blend it together if you wanted to so if you have different colors or say you want to go with something other than yellow that would be how you would use it i think the next thing that i did was just lay this on here and then took a brush with this gouache and just started painting and i'm i'm using the entire sheet of this but it's going to be cut down so and i think when i did this we'll see i think when i hit this with water it just makes it disappear so it was kind of a waste to do that now i would love to take the credit for this project but i can't because this was first done two years ago i think 2019 by lindsay the frugal crafter she was doing a card featuring the pantone color of the year at that time which was a purple it is a gorgeous card i'm going to have hopefully a link at the top if not if i can't do that i'll link it at the bottom so that you can go over and take a look at her video because it's fantastic and her video mostly goes into making the paper the majority of it is that's only a few seconds of stamping but well mine's going to be the same way but if you can just learn a lot a lot more than what i'm going to show you here all right now i'm going to move it this has a lot of white in the background i don't know what i did to start with because i didn't have this much white but that's okay i think i'm gonna try it before i lay that down again okay i think that's good enough just gonna overlap this again all right now draw that again okay so this is what we have so far that's just with the gouache now i think the next thing that i did was to take distress oxide this is fossilized amber's the most yellow color that i have unfortunately i only have like the first 12 so it's definitely a more of a brownish yellow and i'm just going to place this in here i'm going to take a paper towel oh the first one i did it was so cool all right i might just have to do it in pieces and draw in between just gets this great speckling i don't so much care for these larger drops i'm just get rid of those they look pretty cool if they're outlined paper dries fairly quickly as well okay and i'm gonna spray some down in here i apologize for the noise if you can hear it outside there someone is doing some landscaping or something some large trucks and a bobcat try that a little bit okay then the next thing i believe i did i don't even know if this really works but i did it anyway taking just regular mustard seed distress ink putting that down i'm doing the same thing it's definitely more yellowy yeah i like that it's definitely bright yellow kind of fills in some of the white and it's making that gouache kind of move too which i like all right all right the next thing i have is some pearlescent watercolor paints and i'm going to put some in the white this sort of i don't know golden colors so i went with this one this one this one and this one so i'm just mixing these around and we're just going to give a little flick now on lindsay's video she uses metallic paint which is really cool i don't have any metallic paint though i'm just using what i've got all right go over here to this sort of brownish color copper and then this one i used oh i think is this here all right i think that is very lovely paper very very lovely i'll this specialty papers i'm impressed all right so now we need to cut this out and i'm going to go get the dies that i use and i'll show you what i did so onto my die cutting plate i'm placing this a2 die set and i'll have it will be in the description below what i'm using so you can just move it and find the spot that you like the best um i think this looks pretty good and then i have a small square let's see here and i like this part down here with the white sort of veins so i'm going to put my square here if it looked better you know if i want to keep that open then i would obviously put it there so you just kind of have to pick where on your paper that you want to cut out your little square and i believe this paper is sold in eight and a half by eleven so if you're making a big sheet of it you know of course just place this where you like it where it's gonna look the best and i'm trying to um make my edge the same so i'm limited here so i'm trying to bring this down to match the sides and i think of fairly close all right and then obviously place your other mat or whatever they call this plate on top and then run up the machine and i'll be back in a minute okay so we save this little piece here it's very pretty that could be used for something else later all right and so this is what we're going to be working with now the next thing i really this is an idea i had i mean it's similar to things i've done before but it actually worked out pretty well so i have this damask um embossing folder sorry from tim holtz and what i did was place this in here and then use these watercolor pearlescent watercolors and i'm going to use the white to paint oh lordy it's got some dark color in here what i did that would be all right oh i think it's just the bottom of the it's just the bottom of the palette i've used it so much i saw black i'm like oh my gosh i'm going to contaminate my watercolors just paint this up good about the area that will be touching this i think the specialty paper takes more water and stuff than the um the mixed media paper and i'm probably getting a little yellow from the fact that i did this earlier so i'm going to place that down you know obviously put this the other plate on top run it through the machine it's very pretty see that white pearlescent color i love it and of course we've got a lot of cleanup it's gonna be a lot of cleanup with this project all right i'm gonna try this and we'll move on to the next step so in lindsey's video she shows you how to take versamark go around the edges and then she embossed with silver embossing powder i have tried that i think it looks great on her card because one reason is because she's using purple and it just looks really great together i've tried green glitter uh embossing powder and i'll probably show these if i can remember i'll show you what i've done so far but i got the idea yesterday to use glitter art glitter glue i'm assuming you could put glitter with it i am making i am taking a risk here yeah your main adhesive good with all our glitters on most non-washable surfaces okay never done this before but you know i thought glitter glue hey i got some glitter i have some pink glitter and this will come in handy later it's going to match one of the stamp colors that we make we're using kind of a pink color so having no idea really how to do this i want it to look organic i want it to look like lindsey's did whereas you know i want just a line of glitter that's going to look dumb as if you know she took the versamark pad and went around it and it just looks very organic so i'm going to try to do the same just by smushing glue around it all right oh i hope this works because i don't want to do this over again i don't know how thick it has to be i do not have a clue this is the first time i've tried it with this glitter so i don't even know hopefully the colors don't clash and that sort of thing or it just oh oh my gosh i like it oh that's so cool it's a little stray stuff here hopefully i hope it's straight that once this dries i will get rid of that i am impressed oh my goodness all right let me set this aside to dry clean this up and we'll move on to the next step so i cut from a piece of white card stock using the next die up from the one that i used to cut this from we'll just lay this on here just mark off all four corners so kind of help me to figure out where i've got to put my stampings so i've got shady lane and i'm going to stamp it stamp again sort of going in a circular fashion all right so we've made sort of a little wreath next we will use cheerful for our lemons i'm going to go with three next i've got charming pink i have a piece of scrap paper and what i'm going to do is ink it up stamp on the scrap paper which is going to give me a very bright flower and then stamp the second over here let's see what i think of that yeah i've made one where i filled it all in i actually think i like this better um i made one where i put you know the entire it's basically a circle but all this out in here is also filled in so i want to grab a yellow pencil i want to fill in my lemon here this is canary yellow and this is not exactly the same pink well it's pretty close just fill that in a little bit this is apple green test this and see what i'm thinking question is do i fill this in with green and i think i'm going to at least in the wreath area in my previous one i filled everything in i think lindsay and hers use yellow um chalk maybe but since i've yellow i've got so much yellow it hers really popped it really brought that purple together okay i have a water brush i'm just going to move that green around let's have some double-sided tape this is 1 8 of an inch double sided tape makes me nervous because it's so permanent and if you don't get it down right the right way but it is very convenient okay yeah yeah okay i'm like oh no i've been on the wrong side now i got on the right side second guessing myself now which was the right way here i think it was like that all right now it's just a matter of well all right i'm going with it all right isn't that pretty now we flip this over make sure that your back side there is clean and we're going to put foam tape around the edges this is where i've got to take care and remember the steps because i'm going to change some things up from lindsay's and the last one i did was pretty much like hers my practice card so i've had some ideas since then actually her piece of paper here is smaller i went with a larger i sort of eyeballed she doesn't say what what size she used but i kind of eyeballed it and uh decided to go with a bigger bigger piece i felt like there was too much card base when i did mine but then later i noticed that she had a sentiment on the side and that would make sense that you would need that for to be able to do that so okay my foam tape that i have is pretty thin so i'm doubling up so continue to do this and i'll check back in a minute so i have this lawn fawn thanks from the thanks thanks thanks set and also have the die and i've never used the die and the stamp together so i want to do that today but i'm not real sure what color i want to put this in so i think what i'm going to do is i'm going to try a couple colors i really like the idea of yellow but i don't know if it's gonna be enough contrast so i'm going to well let me do this again because some of the black ink that was on this the archival is coming off yeah that's a little bit better see if it's cleaner yeah it gets a little cleaner each time okay so there's yellow and then pink might be cool so in this case i'm going to stamp on my scrap over here just to give it that lighter color ah that's too light all right let's forgo the pink then so i'm gonna go die cut these and we'll figure out which one looks the best so here it is with yellow now i have created about four stacks of the dye just to make it really nice and thick but here's yellow [Music] like that which i think blends in too much but you know it'd be subtle if you like that that one looks better yeah i think that's what i'm going to go with i really wish the pink would have worked but it's all good so i'm going to glue this to a big stack here and maybe i should have just went with like a total of four i think this is going to be a total of five which may be a little bit excessive okay so i'm gonna glue that there now what you could do is use the um score tape sheets and cut out a dive you know from that and that would be your backing and it would just you could remove it and stick it right to it all right now to the next next step of ribbons is that what i want to do next i've got a large sheet of paper this is a i'm going to set this aside um a piece of cream card stock five and a half by four and a quarter but cut long ways at four and a quarter inches and then we're going to score at five and a half so we're doing this backward just so that it could be a top folding card that's what i'm going for i want to emboss this so i'm going to um emboss my card base which is an a2 size but i cut it at four and a quarter long ways and then folded it at five and a half so backward from what we normally do i'm going to stick this in here nope what do i want to do here yeah all right like that i'm gonna run that through the machine it's only gonna really the only thing that's gonna matter on this is the you know there's not gonna be much showing on this so i want to pay attention to try to get as close to the edge so that really will get embossed all right i'll run that through and i'll be back i clean the embossing folder it was kind of wet and there's a little bit of yellow on it but i think that will be okay because most of it's gonna be covered all right so let me look at this all right but we're going to put a cut out a piece of yellow card stock the next size up from the die that i used here all right so that's how it's going to be layered so i'm going to use cheerful ink i'm going to use the stamp that we did not use in the little wreath and i'm paying attention to the outside edge because that is what's really going to show in this and i'm just rotating the stamp creating texture i'll just do this all the way around so here is the finished product all right now let's get to tying some ribbons all right so we're going to go around this with yellow first i'm going to go about in the middle remember we have tape back here i think i might just open that up kind of come around that might be enough to hold it i'll probably tape it just make sure it's really secure i'm just going to tie knot if i can get a hold of it i don't like it i'll remove it all right so we've got one knot there i'm gonna stick this one in the middle and then the yellow bit too tight okay i think i'm going to actually get rid of this and i'm going to put two yellows in the darker green all right pushing these together toward the center all right now it's just a matter of finessing them and snipping the tails getting them where you want them so i'm gonna work on that and i'll show you what i came up with so i have my bows tied i'm going to remove the backing from the foam tape all right and then we're going to i'm going to try to get this centered as best i can hopefully i did okay the only thing about the tape is once you put it down i think that's good so you can see how this created a lot of texture without really anything other than stamping all right and then onto the card base all right i think that has it i've got my when i folded it is not exactly right on the bottom i'm going to take my 14 inch scissors and just give that a little trim just so it'll match all right there is the card i am so so so so so happy you just don't even know how many times i've tried to make this look good and failed i'm going to show you they're not really failures they're just not what you know i was happy with so here's one of the cards this is similar i used the um honeycomb embossing folder similar to lindsay and you can see that i have filled in a lot more here there was so much space this is pretty much i think about the size that she did i think she had an a2 size base i'm not positive but there just seemed to be so much space and hers looks so good i don't know if it's because it's yellow that is just not enough contrast so then i thought well i'll put some distress ink on the outside and water brush it in and you can see how that worked and then for the glitter this is the lime glitter embossing powder by ranger and i have a hard time with it it's hard to tell it's you know it's hard to tell if it's embossed or not so i don't know it wasn't i don't know and then i used um what is it gelatos here which i didn't use today i did have but they only came with like two yellows one was a bright chartreuse and the other was like a lime green more more green in it so yeah all right and then this is one that i did i think i used a lot of distress oxide on this and you can see when you i believe this is over i put white something i can't remember what it was something white around it so i don't know if that is pulling from that or if it's just where you where i heated it too much with the heat tool and it just bubbled up white so it's definitely more stuck on than this is but anywho so i'll show you side by side oh which one do you think is prettier i know which one i do i love it love it love it love this is really what what i was what i was working toward and i hope you love it too now let's make an envelope to match we're going to make a top fold yep top folding envelope all right so i have a yellow piece of paper cut to eight inches by eight inches and we can see here that um an a2 size card is eight inches square and we need to to score at three and nine so here's our nine here's our three rotate the paper we're gonna do eight and a quarter and three and three quarters all right super easy we are going to snip these corners and the little ridge here i like to go on the furthest side of the ridge all right do that for all the corners okay flip it up and we're going to fold it with the bump up we have our one inch corner punch all right fold that bottom up fold in in we're going to take a ruler and we're going to i'm going to line it up with where this point comes together i can't go completely it would be great and probably i don't know why it's off but should be able to go straight across but this one's a little higher up so i'm gonna go with actually you know what i'm gonna go with this one i guess we could sort of go toward the middle i if you're doing this you'll kind of understand what i'm talking about i think hopefully i've got my long scissors you can see this comes to a nice point there maybe and then it's got a little area here that's really what i was talking about so if i were to yeah i think i'm just gonna leave it i don't know why it came out like that but all right so so you just fold it and figure out where the glue is going to go that you don't so i don't want to go any further than that because i don't want to glue my envelope together and i would not use multi glue on this because if you get it somewhere and it doesn't dry it's going to be sticky forever it'll be tacky and you might glue your card inside your envelope and that will not be fun so this entire piece will be glued down i think even that no see i'm i'm telling you this is why you got to think this through so and this is why you don't want to use mono glue because if i use mono glue then i would not be in a good place right here all right so i'm only going up to this point right because i need to be able to put my card in there i'm actually going to take a little off that corner and see that's already pretty well dried it's a great thing about our glitter glue and it dries clear there is our top folding card our top folding envelope for our portrait size card and usually when you make your own envelope you're gonna have a little leeway so that you can get things like ribbons and super duper thick die cut sentiments in there and there it is i hope that you have enjoyed making this card with me today be sure to click below for a complete list of items that i used as well as a link over to lindsay's

the to the fly so it's st. Peggy Michael Teresa Eddie and me and of course three dogs and a cat and that's our crazy house I am gonna show y'all today probably the number one most popular recipe that I have ever printed and shared and this this recipe was given to me I can't take credit for it this woman was this recipe was given to me by a woman in Jacksonville that I liked very very much she was so funny she sent me the recipe and she said Paula this ain't my mama's banana pudding this is good food so it got it got home with that named nacho Mama's banana pudding and I don't care where I go in this United States whether it's the Midwest the Pacific side or the Atlantic side somebody is gonna say something about not your mama's banana pudding and I have to say it's the best no cook banana pudding I've ever eaten and it's really easy to make huh yes my no cook at all so I have the pudding mixed up here now we're using a five ounce box of instant vanilla pudding and it will tell you to add 3 cups of cold water but for this don't go by that recipe use 2 cups of cold water I mean cold me look I'm sorry no don't put wooden with water that would be awful so um 2 cups of milk to a 5 ounce box of banana pudding I'm out sparks of French vanilla pudding and two cups of cold milk now in this bowl we have what is equivalent to a 12 ounce container oh no this is an 8 ounce container of a whipped topping I personally I don't care for whipped toppings I always substitute if the recipe calls for a frozen whipped topping I always make my own fresh cream and I mix up to 1 cup of heavy cream I'll add 1/4 of a cup of sugar and to me that makes it the perfect sweetness so I'm taking this out of the picture because this is fresh whipped cream all right now in this bowl I've got 1 8 ounce package of softened cream cheese and to that I'm gonna add 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and this stuff is so good and every time I open a can of this and use it y'all I think about the one time that we had 17 inches of snow and I made snow cream snow ice cream I would go out and and get a bowl of nice clean snow no yellow snow no brown snow but pure white snow and I would pour a can of sweetened condensed milk into that ice cream with a little teaspoon of vanilla that you see best ice cream you'll ever put in your mouth so if you're somewhere in this country and still getting snow please make some snow cream because it's out of this world all right so I'm gonna take my little and mixer and I'm just gonna beat that up because you want your cream cheese kinda smiling and mine was nice and soft so it's gonna smooth out very very good so now all we got to do is incorporate these three bowls together so that's our sweetened condensed milk that is and our cream cheese now I'm gonna stir in our vanilla pudding which we beat the two cups of cold milk then we're gonna fold this together and not your mama's banana pudding cause the little chess man cookies but I have found it a shortbread cookie works very well too I can't actually remember the name of it maybe Walters but it's a shortbread cookie and it comes in a plaid wrap and those are really really good shortbread cookies and that works just as well - or you can even use a homemade shortbread cookie all right so now in goes our whipped cream I was actually showing y'all the wrong size because I think I said a 12 ounce container and that's what you're supposed to use a 12 ounce container or frozen whipped topping so that's that's the smallest size that they made all right so we're gonna stir this in boom phone you know me hmm and that fresh whipped cream just it just makes all the difference in the world y'all do me in this dish all right the recipe calls for two sacks of the chessmen cookies I find that I usually need three all right now I want to talk to you about bananas I slice my bananas and I sprinkled fruit fresh on them to keep them from turning dark and we're fixing to put this together with our chests and cookies and these little cookies really good y'all turn them up throw them home look like chess pieces okay now here's something else that we need to talk about oh you would have to determine this yourself do you like more custard or do you like more fruit I like more custard I just do so I think the recipe calls for like eight let's see what it calls for it calls for six to eight bananas sliced and I think I have six so it goes on to tell you to pour the mixture over the cookies and bananas and then I think this calls for like doing two layers of it but I do more than that so I'm gonna put some bananas over it and like I said I I just like I just like more custard and cookies and I do bananas here we go so many girls have told me they just that this recipe just made them a star and that makes me so happy to hear that all right this stuff makes up a lot of custard which works out good for me all right another layer of cookies that last layer you'll want to keep them straight and pretty but this one's gonna be covered up so it's alright if they're a little cockeyed so I've already gone through just go okay so that gives us two layers of bananas one thing about banana pudding yow you have to eat it pretty quickly before your banana start turning dark you think you gonna finish this I mean it's taken every bit of that cream this is perfect y'all just perfect and you'll want to make sure you cover those bananas because if they're exposed to air they will Brown a lot faster I can't resist it YUM so good it tastes like the richest of ice creams yes it tastes like ice cream all right so now if you've just bought two bags of chessmen cookies you're gonna be short on the top so that's why I recommend three boxes in that pretty yes my helmets pretty alright third sack now oh I want to tell y'all I have asked y'all to send in suggestions anything that you want to see prepared and a friend of ours from up north Gail she has asked me to make a peanut butter pie and so I'm definitely gonna do that one soon because you're talking about it easy pie that is so good and it's a basically a no foot point so they on will be doing that one soon and what else did somebody ask well Michael any want be somebody else for we've had a bunch oh yeah the chicken is out they wanted a a chicken casserole recipe and I made that yesterday so I'll be making that again soon cuz I ain't paying said that was best meal she says that she's been here in three weeks a chicken and rice casserole just easy easy I know that's not your kind of cooking ain't Peggy's never been a casserole Michael all right so y'all that's it nacho Mama's banana pudding she's a winner every time loving best dishes y'all", "dLvYKA5AvMs": "thank you for answering the pretest i am laura a Aguinaldo a PPS SDC member and clinical toxicologists welcome to ewha's la zona de long SATA guru from ro ro an online CPD on poisoning prevention the objectives for the DCPD are the following first to recognize the common harmful or poisonous substances that may harm children next initially managed a child who has been exposed to poisonous substances thirdly proper referral of children were exposed to the poison control center prevention of exposure of children from poisonous substances based on the latest national data on poisoning the substances that are commonly involved can usually be found inside the home as seen in the data compiled by the national poison management and control center for both pediatric and adult cases similar data are also reported in developed countries like the US wherein substances which may appear innocent enough such as cosmetics toys and art supplies post poisoning threats to our children non pharmaceutical products are responsible for 56 percent of poisoning exposures for children under 5 years of age as adults we have the responsibility of looking out for the safety of children to prevent accidental poisoning events we also have to bear in mind the unique susceptibilities of children which make them at higher risk for the development of serious adverse effects from exposure to toxic substances remember children are not little adults should poisoning occur prompt and appropriate interventions should be undertaken to minimize harmful secondly the following are risk factors for poisoning and supervised home setting lower socioeconomic status males less than five years old lower level of education belonging in a family with a member who is a substance abuser depress the dollar cents and a tall ascent females the products we use in place under the sink are among the most common culprits for accidental poisoning ingestions we should always check if the substances we store there will pose a risk to our young ones the safest thing to do is place this storage areas under lock and key or better yet place them in a secure area outside the house again the products we use on a daily basis which may be left unattended around the home can add to the over forty five thousand child and teen deaths due to poisoning in a year especially in children less than one year old wherein the risk of fatal outcomes from ingestions are highest children as part of their development are natural explorers and extremely curious unfortunately everything they encounter they also want to taste which of course is not always a good thing household cleaning agents are mostly caustic substances which can range from mild to very severe depending on the active component the injury can range from mild local irritation gastric complaints intestinal perforation bleeding circulatory collapse and even death as is the case for a silver cleaner which can contain highly toxic cyanide with regards to the common medications involved the toxic effects will depend on the dose taken computed in milligram per kilogram body weight and management can range from supportive to definitive antidotal therapy the administration of n-acetylcysteine for paracetamol the ferox amine for iron vitamin b6 or pyridoxine for isoniazid and activated charcoal either as a single or multiple dose can be used depending on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs ingested and severity of symptoms proper storage more than proper labeling cannot be overemphasized properly labeled containers will not be helpful at all for very young children pesticides contain a lot of chemicals and the importance of knowing the active ingredient again is pertinent so what's the determinant toxic effects they can range from mild hypersensitivity reactions to fulminant liver failure or death some exposures may require antidote administration such as atropine for organophosphates social nitrate and sodium thiosulfate for cyanide containing substances vitamin K for coumarine derivatives and a settle sustain for sync phosphide personal care products may contain alcohol salicylates and other caustic substances we should also ask for history of g6pd since exposures to these oxidizing substances may trigger hemolytic reactions which may manifest several days after the exposure the incidence decreases after 72 hours the pets we bring in the house can have toxins which can be highly fatal in very young children seen here are the stone fish and lionfish whose erectile fins in their dorsal anal and pelvic spines can inject a toxic venom especially the stone fish whose venom is a neurotoxin with similar effects to a cobra bite other exotic pets should always be kept away from young children plants in and outside the home can also pose a threat hence we have to be very familiar with their qualities and where to put them so that they will be out of reach of children jatropha has a fruit which is very tasty but contain stocks albumin curscene and reefs in which can cause hypocalcemia severe abdominal cramps vomiting and seizure the toxic effects will vary depending on the amount taken and the maturity of the seeds angels trumpet or datura is an outer plant which can act as a bronchodilator and is used in traditional medicine for cough and asthma but in overdose can result in the Alice in Wonderland syndrome remember in med school our mad as a hatter dry as a bone red as a beet blind as a bat memory aid to remember the symptoms of anticholinergic excess - bah\u00eda or dump cane which can also be found in doors have oxalic acid in their stems which can have a tropical irritant effect when the SAP comes into contact with our skin but can cause renal failure if otherwise ingested there are a lot of plans which can have various physiologic and toxic effects such as the following Lance will guard your active steroids which contain cardiac glycosides similar to digitalis seen in foxglove seizure causing plants which have a high content of monitor pinky tones such as found in rosemary sage fennel and eucalyptus plans with cyanogenic or cyanide containing compounds as seen in our local cassava with the scientific name manihot esculenta and plants with mitotic inhibiting properties which are very toxic similar to colchicine which is found in autumn crumples we also have to scrutinize the materials of the toys and arts and crafts products we buy for our children more so now that school time is approaching the quality of the plastic products we buy especially for their drinks and other bond may also leach harmful endocrine disrupting substances into their food and water other culprits to watch out for will be the heavy metals specially mercury and lead let in paint which can be found in older houses or establishments a sources of exposure is also a concern therefore we should make sure there is no peeling or chipped paint in areas where children eat sleep or play and again the importance of always reading the label of our children's toys in cases of accidental poisonings at home what should we do first aid measures first and foremost stay calm check the condition of your child if the poison is swallowed do not give the child anything to eat drink and do not induce vomiting do not give anything to neutralize the poison an exception may be when a caustic substance or sink phosphites phosphide is ingested in this cases egg whites for pediatric age four to six and for adults 8 to 12 may be given but remember that this is only helpful if given within the first 30 minutes of ingestion if inhaled bring out the patient to fresh air we should all also do external the contamination to prevent thermal absorption by thoroughly washing or bathing the child for at least 10 minutes using an alkaline soap such as Perla removing all contaminated clothing flushing the eyes with water or NSS for at least 15 minutes next if we have access contact the poison control center in the area and give them and give them the following data the child's age weight and condition the time of the poisoning event what was ingested the amount of the substance ingested any treatment given any pre-existing medical problems or significant past medical history your name and telephone number follow the instructions given by the poison center if this is not possible then bring the child immediately to the nearest health facility for proper evaluation and treatment some more reminders on the most common substances kerosene or locally known as gas and some pesticides are categorized under hydrocarbons depending on their chemical classification whether aromatic or aliphatic toxic effects are related to their viscosity surface tension and volatility which can aid in anticipating what complications to expect whether pulmonary CNS gi or others the importance of not transferring substances in specially in using containers such as mineral water bottles soda or other drinks cannot be emphasized enough especially since this contributes significantly as to why children accidentally ingest them cyanide containing silver jewelry cleaner as was mentioned is especially hazardous the potency will depend on the concentration of cyanide hence we should ask if it was bought as a solid powdered or liquid form the most toxic is the solid crystal form which is associated with higher more other forums maybe less lethal since it may be diluted or otherwise adulterated because of an increase in poisoning incident seen in the early part of 2000 as reported by the national poison management and control center restrictions which were already present have since been more strictly implemented medications especially isoniazid iron and paracetamol mainly cause hepatic toxicity and in the case of inh intractable seizures again administration of antidotal therapy for each will depend on the amount ingested and clinical signs and symptoms if warranted it should be administered as soon as possible preferably within the first two to four hours from the time of ingestion caustic household cleaners such as bleach liquid salsa muriatic acid oxalic acid and the like should never be on display mixed or transferred to unlabeled containers salicylate toxicity can result not only from ingestion of tablets but through thermal absorption especially in children whose epidermis is still very thin application of highly concentrated liniments may result in significant systemic absorption diagnosis of toxicity is clinical but can be aided by requesting for arterial blood gas computing the anion gap and serum salicylate determination if possible if untreated this could lead to hepatic and renal failure seizures coma and even death symptoms of poisoning may be delayed depending on the history of exposure active contents of pesticides may be permethrin organophosphates or carbamates they have several classes which will depend on it indication for use whether for household agricultural or industrial in addition they may also have cyanide nerve agents ethanol and petroleum distillates among others with regards to the dentist's Ides if the active ingredient is not immediately available we should always ask for color pink green or blue commonly contained coumarine derivatives while black rat poison contains zinc phosphide so in order to prevent poisoning exposures here are some helpful reminders with regards the medications keep all medicine locked and out of reach of children don't put medicine on a kitchen table or bedside table read labels to find out what can be poisonous never leave medicines or potentially poisonous household products unattended while you are using them by child resistant packages when available keep products in their original packages to avoid confusion when administering medication always read labels follow directions and give medicines the children based on their weights and ages only use the dispensers packaged with children's medications never leave out loose pills don't take medicine or vitamins in front of kids and don't call them candy don't involves children as helpers with medication tell grandparents and Friends about avoiding medication poisoning when visiting their homes keep purses and other bags with medications out of reach of children and remind others to do the same for household chemicals we should always store cleaning products in locked closet or cabinets away from food and inaccessible to young children store products in their original containers and never remove product labels scheduled routine cleaning of surfaces and dishwashing when there is a lull in activities such as nap time or when the children are not in the room put products away immediately after removing the amount needed for the cleaning job at hand dispose empty cleaning product containers carefully and promptly don't mix cleaning chemicals as this can emit dangerous gases which can be very harmful especially shion's we can do a lot to raise awareness of child injury and Prevention as part of anticipatory care especially during the holidays or school breaks when children will most likely be at home second integrate child injury prevention into a comprehensive approach to child health and development which can be aided by giving talks mini lectures in schools or daycare or any appropriate setting third implement specific actions to prevent and control child injuries such as child proofing the home in school environment fourth coordinate with the nearest poison center or set up a poison information service in your health facility to strengthen health systems to address child injuries and finally to enhance the quality and quantity of data for child injury prevention conduct more

tip video I'm going to show you how to mix two stroke guys for weed eaters and anything with a two stroke two cycle engine art I'm Michael mix a whole gallon of this I'm just gonna mix a half a gallon this container about half full you give or take a little bit you now if you're looking to contain you'll see different oil ratios per gallon 32 to 140 to 1 and 51 I usually run about a 40 to 1 to the 31 and it's on the line 40 and this cup here is for a 1 gallon so I'm using I'm making the 1/2 account so I'm just going to use half of this ordinarily you won't have to keep checking this like I'm doing I had a little extra oil in here and putting her to put just a little extras and what it calls for it's always better to have more role they're not enough you and if you poor you all in here close it up shake it up mix it all up I'll get it into gas and do this every time before you use it dude that usually about all you need to do well thanks for watching guys hope this helped you out

and I am finally about to actually make this piece so in Beauty and the Beast there's a rose that comes up in this dropping petals and instead a glass dome it actually didn't have a base but I need the base so that I can use the motor inside to turn my flower and it protects this a little bit so my idea was to make a flower in this case of rose it's all made out of spoons I have this recorded somewhere else this is just an update video but this video will be coming out I received this handle and I will put the person's name right here because I have a four-second lovely thank you very much I'm so excited yesterday I forgot to start filming the process for getting into this point and getting this to fit inside here but I figured it that the knife handle I had to have those patterns called first love so because of love theme and rose and the story I felt it was appropriate to have this base or this bottom so I have quite a bit of work to do here still but my idea is I want this to rotate right here so it's going to be on the base and just kind of rotate like this when the motors turned on that's the idea making it work is still an engineering process so I have some stuff I have some floral tape I'm going to use I have some ideas for making little leaves come out like on a rose and I even have a couple little petals that I'll be making to sit at the bottom and then of course is to get repainted and everything but I just wanted to do an update of that a lot of people have been asking me what's the plug for and I am super excited hopefully soon I'll be able to get to actually put this together for you on camera get everything edited and have something that's really really nice and get it out of my head which is very important looping loop loop loop everything over and over again so just a quick update I thank you guys for joining me on my journey and please subscribe share like and if you like this video give it a thumbs up so I hope you guys have a great day and keep making", "5SulILZNPEI": "hi guys my name is Hannah and today I'm going to show you how easy and fun it is to make your own soy candles soy candles make great gifts for friends and family but they're also great if you want to make some extra cash or even a full-time income I own several candle companies and each year we hand pour and sell thousands of candles all over the country with these same steps and ingredients that I'm going to show you from Pro candle supply.com people are always telling us how strong our fragrances are and how well our candles burn and that's because we spend so much time perfecting our candles so that we can provide the best product possible everybody thinks it's really difficult to make a soy candle but it's really not and I'm going to show you exactly how we do it step-by-step so let's get started okay so first things first let's gather what we need first step is release my wax we're going to be using golden brands 460 for soy wax it's all groaning the United States from us grown soybeans and it's all natural second you're going to need a container there's lots of containers out there to choose from we're going to keep it simple with an 8 ounce tin next you're going to need a wick the wicks on propionyl supply calm are already pre tabbed so I highly suggest them next are glue stickers some people use hot glue guns I really prefer to use the glue stickers they're a lot easier you literally just pull them off pull the tab off stick them to the bottom of the wick and stick them to the container and then you're done I believe they hold up to like 180 degrees Fahrenheit so it makes it really easy and it just keeps the wick in place while it's cooling next you'll need some type of wick holder this centers the liquid cooling we use the bow tie clips and you can find these on Pro candle supply calm as well and there's three slots on them and you stick the wick right through and there's a tab notch for it and it secures it you're going to need fragrance oil today we're going to be using pro candle supplies lavender it's one of our most popular and strongest fragrance oils you're going to be needing a pitcher a pour pitcher and it's got a plastic handle so it doesn't get hot when the wax gets hot you're going to need a kitchen scale any kitchen scale really works you're going to need a heat source today we're using a hot plate but you can use a microwave a double boiler or presto pot either of those it's important when you're adding the wax and heating it up that you stir though because if you just add the wax in in and let it sit it can burn next is a thermometer we're using a candy thermometer they clip right onto the side of the poor pitcher they're easy to use they're cheap and they're easy to read you're gonna need something to stir the wax with preferably something metal this is what I think I got this all-pro kennel supply calm as well and I believe that's it so it sounds like it's a lot of stuff but it's really not and for the price that you paid them all for a couple candles you can literally make dozens of candles for the same price and once you have all the Euro supplies you can make a candle for literally less than several dollars and that leaves a huge profit margin if you're selling the candles for a profit okay so the first step for making your sort candle is to get your wax one pound this should be sufficient for three of the eight ounce candle tins you're gonna measure out one pound with your kitchen scale and place it in your pitcher I've already measured out one pound of wax and placed it in my picture on my heat source so go ahead and do that and then you're gonna want to bring your wax to 185 degrees Fahrenheit it's especially crucial that the wax hits 185 degrees because of this temperature for this particular wax it's the best temperature for the fragrance oil to bind with a wax and produce the strongest smelling candle and the best burning smelling candle the best burning candle anyways so I've already hit on 85 degrees so going to as it hits 185 remove it from the heat source and then I'm going to take the sample bottle that comes in the starter kit on pro candle supply comm and this is one out so it's perfect for one pound of wax and you're going to add it into the wax okay once is added in you want to stir about 20 or 30 times once I started 20 or 30 times you can set it off to the side and while it's cooling you have a perfect time to prep your containers so we're going to take the 3/8 ounce tenets that we're using for the 1 pound of wax we're going to remove the lids we're gonna take our cotton wicks you'll need 3 of them take 3 glue dots you're gonna remove them from the paper and stick them directly on the tabs of the wicks okay then you remove the sticker on all three weeks then you're going to stick the wicks right into the center of the tins okay okay so now your wicks are stuck nice and stuck you're gonna take your bow tie clips which are also in the starter kit all this in the starter kit and you're gonna stick them right down on the wicks and secure them with the notch and there you go they're ready to go so pretend we waited like 20 minutes or so usually doesn't take that long but you want the wax to cool to about 135 to 140 at that time it might be a little bit cloudy you want to make sure it doesn't get too funny or that you can't pour it but the poor you pour soy wax the prettier the top is so if you pour it too hot you're gonna get more craters if you pour it too cold you won't get all the wax in the container so it has to be just perfect and then you get the best most consistent top to this so once it's cool and you start it you just take it and you're gonna pour right into the tins and this is the easy part okay and literally that's it so I know it's going to be hard to wait but you need to wait at least overnight to let the candle set but then the next morning you should be able to remove the wick holders and you can cut the wicks so if you're going to be selling your candles you might want to cut your wicks a little bit longer so that if the wax swells at all with here why not then you won't have to worry about the wick getting too short but if you're using the candle right away you just want to cut it to a quarter-inch because that gives the best burn so I made this candle yesterday I already put on the label and whatnot but I've cut the wick to about 1/4 inch because I'm going to be burning this tonight but this is what the end product will look like it's a nice clean top with a cut wick in a pretty label with a nice tin lid and that's it so I hope you've enjoyed this video I hope it was easy to follow I really just want to help you learn how to make these really fun products so if you have any questions comment below and subscribe thanks guys bye", "g8AZ2IS3-Us": "this delicious cheese strata something you'd find it an elegant fancy restaurant we make it fast

over your lips not on your hips absolutely mouth-watering delicious to the last bite", "At4GymbpiSU": "- This is the most requested\ncake on our channel, and I'm gonna teach you how to make it. (upbeat music) Hey, everybody. It's Natasha of NatashasKitchen.com, and today I'm gonna show you\nhow to make red velvet cake. This is moist, and you're gonna love how we make the ultimate\ncream cheese frosting. And I'm craving cake so let's get started. (drums) You'll need to preheat your\noven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, then grease two nine-inch\ncake pans with butter. Also, to keep the cakes\nfrom sticking to the pans, I also like to dust with\na little bit of flour, and make sure to tap out the excess. Once you have your cake\npans buttered and floured, set those aside until\nyou're ready to use them. This quick prep will ensure\nthat the cakes release easily. Now we'll make the cake batter. Combine two and a half\ncups of all purpose flour, two tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa, a teaspoon of baking soda,\nand half a teaspoon of salt. Quickly whisk those together\njust until they're combined. Now, we're gonna sift the dry ingredients to make sure everything\nis really well blended. Sifting also ensures that your cake crumb is soft and fluffy, and I will link to the\nsifter in the notes. Set aside the dry ingredients. Now in a large mixing\nbowl, combine one half cup or one stick of softened unsalted butter, and one and a half cups of sugar. Cream those together\nwith an electric mixer. It takes a minute or two for the butter and sugar to come together,\nand you just wanna keep mixing until the sugar is\nmoistened with the butter, and it has a powdery snowy consistency. You'll need two room temperature eggs. Add those one at a time,\nbeating well with each addition. Once the eggs are well incorporated, add two teaspoons of vanilla extract, and we're using our homemade extract. I will leave a link to\nthe two-ingredient recipe in the notes. Quickly blend in that vanilla. Now with the mixer on, add three fourths cup of vegetable oil, or you can use a light olive oil. I have one cup of room\ntemperature low-fat buttermilk. And into that, I'm gonna stir in one teaspoon of white vinegar. The buttermilk and vinegar mixture adds great moisture to the cake and activates the baking soda so you end up with a very fluffy cake. Add the buttermilk mixture, and blend until smooth\nand well-incorporated. Now add your dry ingredients all at once, and with the mixer on low\nspeed, stir until well blended. Stop mixing once it's evenly moist and you no longer see\nany dry streaks of flour. Also make sure to scrape down\nthe bowl while you're mixing to catch any pockets of flour. Now last but not least, we're gonna turn this into\na red velvet cake batter. To make it that classic red color, I highly recommend using\na gel food coloring. This is the one that I'm using, and I will link to this\nin the recipe notes. All you need is half a teaspoon, and a little bit goes a long way. You could even use less food\ncoloring if you wanted to, just add it to your preference using the mixer on low speed, mix until the color is well\nincorporated into the batter, scraping down the bowl as needed. Once the batter is uniform in color, you're gonna transfer it, and divide it evenly between\nyour prepared cake pans. My best tip for getting even cake layers is to use a digital kitchen scale. Zero out your cake pan, then you can see exactly how much batter you've\npoured into each cake pan. And make sure to get every last drop of that yummy red velvet cake batter. Now use your spatula to spread the batter evenly into the pans, and\nwe're gonna transfer that and bake in a preheated oven\nat 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 30 minutes. What I love about this recipe\nis the cake layers rise evenly and have a level top, so\nthere's no need to trim. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into\nthe center of the cake, and it should come out clean. Once the layers are out of the oven, let them rest in their\npans for about 20 minutes. Run a thin spatula or knife\naround the edges of the cake to loosen them from the pans. Now carefully invert the\ncake onto a wire rack. Sometimes you need to\ngive the pan a little tap for it to slide out, but\nnormally, they slide out easily. Once your layers are on your\nrack, you wanna set those aside and let them cool completely\nto room temperature before adding the frosting\nand assembling your cake. To make our favorite\ncream cheese frosting, you'll need one and a half cups or three-fourths pound of\nunsalted softened butter. Make sure you do not\nover-soften your ingredients. This has been at room temperature for about an hour and a half, and you can see that you can indent it slightly with your finger, but it should still be a\nlittle bit cool to the touch. Add that butter in pieces\nto a large mixing bowl, and use an electric mixer\nto beat that on high speed for about a minute, or until it's smooth\nand lightened in color. And it's important to scrape\ndown the bowl periodically to make sure you don't\nhave any chunks of butter that aren't blended. (mixer buzzing) Now add your softened cream cheese. And again, you wanna use\na block style cream cheese and make sure it's not overly softened. The key to having a thick and spreadable cream cheese frosting is to make sure that your ingredients are at the right temperature. (mixer buzzing) Now beat those together\non medium-high speed until the cream cheese and\nbutter are well incorporated, scraping down the bowl as needed. Now add one tablespoon of vanilla extract and an eighth of a teaspoon\nor a generous pinch of salt. Beat those in until well combined. I like to add four cups or a total of one pound of powdered sugar, because I think it has the\nbest balance of sweetness. We're gonna add the powdered\nsugar one cup at a time, and mix on low speed\nuntil it's incorporated. (mixer buzzing) Once all of the powdered sugar is in, kick the mixer up to high speed and continue beating for\nanother two to three minutes or until the frosting is\nwhipped, thick, and spreadable. All right, our frosting is ready, and our cake is now at room temperature so it's time to assemble. Place that first cake layer\nonto a serving platter, and we're gonna add a\ngenerous amount of frosting over the top. I love a thick layer of\nfrosting between my cake layer, so I'm using about a third of the frosting Spread that evenly to\nthe edges of the cake. Now top that with your second cake layer. And I like to place it upside down so that you have the\nsmoothest, most even surface for the top. Now we're gonna crumb coat the cake, which means that you're gonna\napply a thin layer of frosting all the way around the cake. Crumb coating glues the crumbs down and seals in the moisture of the cake. Once you've finished\nwith an even crumb coat, add a little bit more\nfrosting to the top and sides until it's evenly coated. I love using my offset spatula for this, it makes frosting your\ncake so much easier, and I will link to this tool and all of our favorite\ntools in the notes. Once you're satisfied\nwith your frosted cake, wipe the base of the cake\nplatter with a paper towel. Now transfer the remaining\nfrosting into a piping bag, fitted with a large open star tip. We're gonna use the rest of\nthis cream cheese frosting to pipe puffs over the top of the cake. And because the frosting has\nbeen out for a little bit, and I'd like it to firm up, I'm gonna pop this into the refrigerator while we add sprinkles to the cake. This is how I like to\ndecorate my red velvet cake. I'm using two different\nkinds of red sprinkles. Start by adding the larger sprinkles around the top border of the cake. Also apply some sprinkles to\nthe bottom edge of the cake. And I'm just gently tossing\nthe sprinkles onto the side, I don't have any secret tricks for this. And because I have the base\nof my cake platter clean, I'm able to reuse some of the sprinkles that fall off the edge. I'm also using some red sanding sugar, and following the same pattern. And the sanding sugar just\nfills in the sprinkles. This way of decorating\nmakes it look really pretty for a birthday, or Valentine's\nDay, or even Christmas. Once you've cleaned off\nyour extra sprinkles from your cake platter, we're gonna pipe that chilled\nfrosting over the top. Add little rosettes or puffs\nover the edges of the cake. Before cutting into this, I like to refrigerate\nit for about an hour. This will firm up the frosting slightly and just make it much easier to slice. Who's excited? (laughs) I am, (laughs) 'cause I\nget to have some cake. And it's just firm enough now\nwhere I can slice it easily. That's the only reason to refrigerate, just to make it easier to serve, the cake layers stay\ntogether a little bit better. So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do the taste\ntest 'cause I want some cake. All right, here we go. And I do like to wipe the\nknife in between slices, so that way you'll get a really clean cut, just like we do with cheesecake. Okay, here we go. Oh my goodness, look at that. (laughs) Oh, okay, yum yum, yum. Okay, and we're just gonna go for it because I want my cake. (laughs) I wanna have my cake, and I'm\ngonna eat it too. (laughs) Okay, here we go. Oh, and it is so soft. The cream and the cake, super\nmoist, just the perfect crumb. That is exquisite! (laughs) We're bringing out the big words. (laughs) Seriously, it tastes like\na bakery quality cake, like a fancy bakery. It is moist, and you can taste that little bit of cocoa in the cake. The cake itself has so much rich flavor. It's just so decadent and delicious. Seriously, it's like I can't stop it, just one bite because it's really good. It's like melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I also love that it's not overly sweet, both the cake and the\nfrosting, it is just right. And maybe that's why I can\nalways eat a really big piece. (laughs) You can freeze the cake and\nyou can freeze the frosting, which is awesome because I\nlove make-ahead desserts, perfect for parties.

to estimate all the epoxy that you need for your next project check it out [Music] alright guys so from almost the beginning of this channel you guys have been asking me Nathan how do i guesstimate how much epoxy I need Nathan how much epoxy does it take to fill up this mold how do you do that well today I'm gonna show you check this out so I have a piece of pecan here that I've already ripped down on my bandsaw as you can see here so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna show you step-by-step how to guesstimate how much epoxy you need to fill a river step 1 you need to set the outside dimensions of your table or clock or art project or whatever you're using to fill the void using casting epoxy or whatever project you're making [Music] okay now that you have your pieces set up the way that you want them what we're going to do is we are going to measure the width across which is 17 inches and we're gonna measure the length of our table let's see see the longest part here let's go 26 and 1/4 okay let's write that down [Music] okay so now that we have our table set up or your project set up we want to know how much epoxy will it take to fill the void in your project to measure the widest point of your River or void or whatever you're gonna fill with epoxy okay okay so out of this whole piece we're gonna stop right here and we're gonna measure this part right here which is the widest point of the river and that is about four inches okay so we're gonna write that down four inches is the widest part of that River [Music] since our project has a really weird shape to the void we're going to break it up in two sections we're going to measure to this point right here and then we will calculate this space right here all right so let's get the measurement here it's about 20 and a half inches so we're gonna do 20 point 5 times 4 times the thickness of our board one in three-quarter inches go ahead and multiply those three numbers together and you will get a cubic inch value after you have that value go ahead and mark it down and we'll move on to the next step okay after multiplying those three numbers together we got one forty three point five inches so the next step measure that weird shape on the end and what I like to do is just make everything into a rectangle because if even if you have just a little bit more epoxy left over it's better to have too much than too little so we already have the 17 inches from before and we already have the thickness which is an inch and 3/4 so what we're gonna do for the third number is we're going to measure from here to the end of our board from here to here so what you can do is grab a straight edge whatever you'd like to use in my case I'm gonna grab an old coca-cola box we're gonna set it right there up to it let's measure so it looks like we are just about at six inches so let's write down our three numbers six inches long by 17 inches tall by one and three-quarter inches thick so we'll multiply those together 178 point six five it's cubic inches okay now we're going to take our two numbers we're going to add those together one forty three point five plus one seventy eight point five gives us three hundred and twenty-two cubic inches okay now that we have the cubic inch number that we need what we have to do is convert cubic inches into gallons and this will work with whatever system you're using whether it's metric or US standard or imperial people like to call it but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use Google will to take my cubic inch number and turn it into gallons so we're gonna see how many gallons it's gonna take to fill this river are you ready okay I'm not sure if you guys can see this but we're gonna take our volume and we're gonna type in 322 cubic inches and that is gonna give us one point three nine gallons all right guys it is as simple as that I know it may take a little bit for you guys to understand that but just watch this video over and over so you can get the hang of it the cool thing is is that this piece right here is only gonna take one of stone Koch countertops super cast kit because in the kit it is a one and a half gallon kit 1.5 gallons and this came out to just a hair under that so to do a project this size it will take only one kit guys I hope you really enjoyed this video I hope that you learned a lot do me a favor if you like this video

"o8AXullC95M": "[Music] [Music] did that look familiar to you well if so then you are absolutely not alone a lot of people have problems converting recipes from things like cups into grams and vice versa so today I decided to share a few tips and tricks on how to achieve this very effortlessly and I'm gonna provide you with a list of conversions as well as tips on how to measure ingredients properly and finally I wanted to discuss very very quickly the pros and cons for each measuring system so let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so finally a quick word about the pros and cons I myself tend to go back and forth between using my cups and using a scale and you see this in some of my videos it really depends on what I'm doing for example if I'm making a caramel sauce I tend to be very precise so I'd like to use a scale for such a thing so if consistency is important to you and you want to achieve a perfect cake or cookie every single time then I suggest that you use a scale and measure things in grams so that you get this exact same amount per batch but if you're looking for a rough estimate of what goes in a recipe for example a chocolate chip cookie where you roughly want 2 cups of chocolate chips but if there are a little bit more nobody will mind then definitely use cups using measuring cups is a very visual way of measuring ingredients this is perfect for getting kids involved into baking because they love just how interactive it all is cups are more fun I have to say that so I personally love using both professionals prefer obviously the scale because of the preciseness and consistency that you achieve per recipe but kids and people that aren't getting into baking certainly like using cups so it's really up to you and what you're trying to achieve so that's it for me today I hope you found this useful and if you like this video you then click on that like

welcome back to whimsy Creek art alright today's video is gonna be a fun one so here are the supplies we've got flow trawl and then we have master's touch paint today we have titanium white pink ultramarine blue cobalt blue pale blue turquoise green Viridian magenta violet and yellow deep so those are the colors we're gonna be working with today and this is with the Masters touch fun fine art studio acrylics alright so here we're gonna get to mixing our colors okay so what we have here is some cups and some regular old popsicle sticks and we're gonna start mixing up the colors and we're gonna do one part paint to three parts float roll so I use about two parts float roll if it's one of the thinner paints like a craft paint but if it's a thicker paint like this master's touch is pretty thick here let me show you see it's a pretty thick paint and so we're gonna do one part paint to three parts float roll and then we're gonna check the consistency and we might put a little bit of water we may not need any water then we check it afterwards so I have a couple of videos on how I mix my paint my consistency of my paint and all that see I'm gonna go ahead and link below the videos on how to mix the paint but I'm gonna go ahead and mix up a little bit of each of these colors right now off-camera and I'll show you the consistency we're going for alright now I have all the paints mixed up and I ended up having to put about a teaspoon of water in each color and so we have a pretty good consistency here and what we're looking for is for it to run off this stick but kind of sit across the top not sink right away and I do have other videos on specifically the consistency of paint and so I did all the colors and white that I had gone over before on the Masters Touch paint so one color I did on end is this lighter purple and I just did that by adding 's equal parts of the white and the violet and so I mixed equal parts parts of white and violet to get a little bit of a lighter purple and so that's what we have and so I'll get going and this is top 20 paint pours of 20 20 and they're in no specific order just gonna go ahead and get down my favorite 20 paint pours right now we're just about ready to pour we need to add a little bit of silicone so what we're gonna do is we take spot on treadmill oil and this is 100% silicone oil and you can use whatever silicone oil you're using and so we want to just put it very little you don't want to go overboard with your silicone so this cups probably 2/3 or throw these 3/4 of the way full a little more so we want to put probably two drops in this one and that's it no more than that and you can go ahead and mix that up I don't really mix it you know super super well but that about that much and then that's good all right now I'm gonna get silicone in each of the colors but not the white all right so we're not going to go in any specific order we're just gonna do my top 20 paint pours of 20 20 and there are so many more than 20 different techniques I've just chosen my top 20 and we're not gonna go into any specific order all right we're gonna start out easy and we're gonna start out with a dirty poor and right now I'm just pouring the cups the paint in the cup layering a man really no specific order kind of going for the brighter kind of primary colors for this one and for all 20 paint ports today I am going to be using 6x6 inch ceramic tiles just to keep it keep it a cohesive look for all 20 paint pores and you can get these ceramic tiles at your local Lowe's or Home Depot and I don't do anything to the surface but maybe clean them with a little bit of alcohol if they need it alright so we've layered the cup this is a three ounce cup I forgot about oh two two and a half ounces in the cup I am now pouring it on the surface and wow those cells just pump right up and that's just was using two drops in each color notice I put my hand here to add an L shape and this L shape kind of catches the paint as I leaned it to each side so I'm gonna lean the tile over and kind of get it to the edge get it to the corner and then a little bit back to the center completely back to the center but somewhat so back to the center and then on to the next corner and I do that for all four corners and notice I kind of use my hand my fingers to kind of help it I kind of pull it along that kind of helps it get it all the way to that corner now I'm pulling that gravity of that paint back to the center a little bit and that is a dirty pour so that is our first pour of our twenty paint Wars of 2020 now I'm gonna give it a little bit of a torch I'm only about oh four six forty six inches away from the tile I do not have my flame right on the tile you don't want to scorch your paint and I'm just using a creme brulee torch or a bhoot butane small oak gym torch alright here's a close-up let's look at that Wow quite a difference we've got a variety of cells that's kind of nice to have these smaller cells and the larger ones a little bit of lacing and here are some close-up shots of the same or you all right and for our next floor we're gonna put down a little bit of face paint some of that white that we mixed up with no silicone and we're gonna put that down as a base layer here and this is our second paint for of 20 I'm just gonna go ahead and spread this out I have set this up a little bit to just kind of you know it's kind of the boring part spread not like paint out now that we've got all the paint spread out now we're gonna go ahead this is a napkin ring paint pour or you can do it with toilet paper rolls or some people call this an open cylinder paper but I like to use these plastic dollar tree napkin rings they're in overbites a party section party supplies kind of the wedding supply section of the Dollar Tree and you get six of them for a dollar they're used for a napkin ring and they work great for this technique open cylinder or napkin ring paint pour okay so I'm just taking you don't need much for this technique you're gonna have negative space and that's that it whatever base color you use background color and it does not have to be white you're gonna see in later pours for this video I do not use white as my negative space color but this one we are using white so notice I'm not pouring them in I'm kind of just using the popsicle stick to get a little bit of paint in there because you don't need much now I'm getting it closer to the corner and I'm slowly feathering that napkin ring up just to let a little bit of paint out but not all of it at once so I'm kind of just feathering it across the camp canvas pulling or not canvas tile in this case and you could use tile canvas for any of these techniques they work for any of them I'm just using tile cuz that's what I had on hand so I'm gonna go ahead and give it another little bit of torch oh you see the cells pop up right away with that torch okay now I'm gonna tilt the tile a little bit try to get that paint to come over to that other corner a bit more but I don't want to tilt it too aggressively because I do like the cells and that little bit of lacing I have through that white that's what we paint pores call that a little delicate lacing across that white so I am just trying to tilt it a little but not too aggressively and I'm just trying to get the paint to that corner a little bit more and you'll notice here in just a second I'm gonna grab here an aquarium tubing I use aquarium tubing to blow out the edges you can use a straw or whatever you have on tap on hand I like to use the aquarium tubing because it's reusable and you can use it over and over and over again it's very affordable and I can direct the flow a little bit of better of the air so I have got this vertical with the tile you don't want this right horizontal straight on straight out the cam or the canvas or tile you want this vertical with it and you're just lightly feathering you can see I'm just going back and forth back and forth while I'm chase real lightly blowing the air through so I'm gonna blow that paint pretty aggressively here in the corner trying to get it towards the corner all right now I like this because it gives it a more organic shape and not all paint process if I'd done this you'll see later in this video there's a couple right do not blow out the edges it's just kind of whatever vibe I'm going for for that particular painting and here is a close-up of the final product and some close-up shots you'll notice each pore I do I'll do the technique explain it some tips and then I'll give you a close-up of it and a couple close-up shots so you can see how it turns out and that's kind of how I do all my videos I show you the technique then I do a close-up video of it and then some close-up shots and each one on this video I do that as well all right third paint pour out of our top 20 of 20/20 all right so this one's gonna have a blue negative space and this is gonna be what I call a central swipe there's so many different names and many different techniques have multiple names throughout the years they've gotten different names and such so I just call this a central swipe but what I'm doing here is I'm just taking my palette knife I just have these plastic cheap palette knives from the Dollar Tree and I'm spreading my paint my base color and you can use any base color when we're talking negative space it does not have to be white or have to be black it can be any color we're just negative space meaning leaving a little bit of that base that background color showing not covering it completely and so I'm getting this read about and then I'm gonna go ahead and put some colors down the middle again some of the brighter primary colors and at the beginning of this we've gotten named all the different colors were using today it's a little bit of that magenta and this color this is a real pretty color I mean this master's touch paint is new to me so I really enjoyed using it each technique really did well with the Masters Touch paint I think it is a good versatile paint for all different paid pouring techniques it is a little bit on the thicker side but if you get it the right consistency and get it down to where you want it it really worked well and so I'm just getting a thin layer of paint down the center of the tile I'm not really wanting a lot that's why I'm using my popsicle stick to just get a little bit of paint and so I'm gonna finish it off here with this real nice bright yellow and you can do a swipe in many different ways of doing a swipe this is the first of several swipes I'm gonna go ahead and show you in the top-20 paint pours and this I just call a central swipe so I use these plastic paint palette or these palette knifes because they've got a real nice they're not very heavy they're super light so for a swipe they work real well so just let the knife kind of guide glide across the top you don't want to put too much pressure in it just barely let it kind of glide across the top and then after each time I swipe through the colors I am wiping it off and off-camera I've got a rag and I'm just wiping the surface of the power knife and then going and again for another one and I'm trying to grab a variety of colors so I kind of bring yellow down one side purple down one side I don't want all the yellow in one spot and all the purple so I'm trying to kind of break that up as I'm pulling them down and I'm just going about halfway on some three-quarters on some paint give it a variety there as well the swipe technique does do some really nice lacing so if that's what you're going for a lacing look it does do lovely lacing with the swipe technique so here we're just finishing off swiping that last little end little bit and so that is and I'm gonna go ahead and fix this bald spot here with the edge of the palette knife that is a central swipe I've also called a scenic called like a ghost swipe I believe a ghost wave is the little variation of this now torching again remember not to get too close you don't wanna you're just kind of heating or popping any air bubbles you might have so here in the close-up we can see that lacing really well and has just barely across the top kind of delicate that is real nice you all right and for our fourth paint pour of our 20th for top 20 of 2020 it's gonna be what I can't kind of been calling a whimsy swipe and the reason I call it this is I just kind of put the paint down all over and no real order kind of just throw it down whimsically and all over and then I'm just swiping in all directions all right there is a central swipe there's just an all-over swipe where you swipe the whole thing and there's many different types of swipes and so this one I just kind of have affectionately named it the whimsy swipe but it's just a random swipe and again I'm just gonna throw the colors down randomly all over throw on some of these purples and a little bit of blues and that real pretty kind of turquoise the green color and then I'm gonna grab my palette knife I may use those plastic palette knifes again from the Dollar Tree I'm just lightly letting the palette knife the weight of the palette knife which it is a very light pellet knife just kind of glide across the top real carefully I'm not trying to press down at all just let the weight of the palette knife glide across the top of the paint and I am if the paint isn't all the way to one edge I'm just pulling it to the edge and then pulling it across randomly and kind of with whimsy I this has been one of my favorite techniques lately I've been really just enjoying different color combinations and trying out different directions and kind of going in swirls or diagnol you can just wherever you feel and if you get a spot you don't really like swipe through it again throw some more color down swipe through it you can also get your I use the clam tubing or your straw and you can blow out some parts you don't like so it's a very forgiving technique as well so it's quite fun because you can just you don't have to put a lot of thought into it and just kind of go with ever whimsy whatever color you feel like direction you feel like going so it's been a real fun technique and it does create a good variety of different size cells and thus so that creates a nice good pleasing looking painting for the high it's nice to be able to see you know some of them real larger cells some delay seeing some of the small cells all in the same art piece I particularly personally enjoyed that to see the larger cells small cells Leasing kind of a variety in the same piece that's kind of neat to see and so this whimsy swipe does kind of create that you get a good variety of lacing fail sizes yeah and so here again I am just gonna go ahead and give it a little bit of a torch but this time it's not really doing much I have already kind of made all the cells pop up that are going to pop up here in the corner of this green lacing oh that's really pretty across the top of that purple this one kind of reminds me kind of mermaid vibe to it some mermaid colors you all right now for our fifth paint pour out of our twenty this is a blown flower what I like to call a whimsy bloom and so I'm just putting some of the paint down in the middle some of that violet and a little bit of the magenta and I haven't put anything special in this paint this is just like we mixed it up at the very beginning of this video float roll paint and a tiny bit of water and just like two little drops of silicone I would love to be able to take its Shelly arts course someday on her blooms but for now this is how I do my blooms without adding anything extra I know with her blooms there's a lot few other ingredients well this is just what the paint I've already mixed up and have on hand I'm taking that aquarium tubing and just blowing very gently right across the two colors and kind of throwing them like across the top of the white and I'm trying to create almost you know like a flower petals and this these can be done so many different ways they can be just one bloom in the center it looks really nice doing them a bloom in the corner with the petals you know from the center of the flower being in the corner of the canvas or tile and you can do them also like a bunch of flowers not just one on there so they can be done many different ways quite a fun technique you you okay for our number six out of 20 this is a bottle bottom cake for kind of resembles a flower and so I've laid a little bit of yellow paint down in the middle kind in the middle of the flower and I'm just kind of getting it kind of tilted around kind of about the size of the bottom of my bottle now this is a real tiny bottle that I was able to find they've got all different sized soda bottles water bottles and I just cut off the bottom and I'm like putting laying it right there over the top of that yellow now I'm gonna try to evenly in the middle so it goes down evenly all different sides I've got some of the blue and I'm just gonna randomly layer some blues and greens first and then I'm gonna get two more some traditionally flower colors please excuse the paint they're on my arm I need to wash that off and so I'm just trying to get it straight into the center and so it evenly goes down each edge of the paint each edge of the bottle bottom and I sometimes use propel sports drink bottoms because they have multiple they have six of the little knobs creating more of a crevice for the paint to go down so now putting down some of the magenta and you can do this technique and any any of these techniques can be done with silicone or without silicone and as you saw at the very beginning of this video each of my colors do have silicone so um here you are gonna see a few cells pop up but I don't torch it so then that created we're not a ton of cells popped up and I'm alternating the colors back and forth trying to get them evenly but they kind of have a mind of their own and so I'm trying to pay attention when I put down the next color if the color before did go down one side a little bit too much maybe I'm gonna try to even it out with this next color but I mean you can't do too much you just gotta kind of get it as even as possible after we get all the paint layered on here then we're gonna very carefully lift that bottle bottom now that is slippery so it is kind of hard to lift up make sure that you just lift it straight up and that you have kind of a landing spot for it I've got a little tray off-camera here I'm gonna lift it straight up and get it out of there it's trying not to tilt it because then you will tilt the paint off and kind of skew your the way it looks now I'm gonna grab a clean popsicle stick here and I'm gonna take the popsicle stick through each of the what you can kind of call petals kind of created more of the petal of a flower look now you can do this sometimes I go just once down the center of each petal sometimes I go down three times just depends on what look your look going for any of these techniques you can change them up and you can do it your way that's what's so fun and the freedom with paint pouring is you can do it any way you really want you don't have to use that popsicle stick down the center how I just did it and each time I took the popsicle stick down each side of the petal I did wipe it off and then put it back through clean again to do the next petal so now I am tilting it tilting it to each corner and kind of helping it there with my fingers once you get once it gets about an inch or so away from the corner I'm just kind of hoping it kind of helps it to squeeze it down there to the last little bit always check your edges always check your corners they can easily messed us just so much easier to get them painted now than to have to go back and try to do it and so each time I tilt to a corner you'll notice I am somewhat tilting it back to the center then on to the next corner then back to the center and then on to the next corner now with this technique you don't want to tilt it too aggressively if you tilt it too aggressively you may slide it right off the edge so you want to just very easily tilt it to each side so here we go that's kind of an abstract flower and this is just a 6x6 ceramic tile if you do have a larger canvas you can kind of see the whole definition of the flower a little bit more on a larger surface but on these smaller tiles that looks going to need as well you all right and for number seven out of 20 we have a flip cup and the flip cup is a super easy accrete paint pour for beginners to do I'm just gonna I have a three ounce cup this is again a six by six inch tile I'm gonna get about two two and a half ounces in this cup to get the whole surface I'm just layering them randomly and I'm going with some of these pastel colors I haven't used too many of those that we mixed up here and so I'm gonna just layer them here with a little bit of the white and now I've got about two two and a half ounces I'm gonna take that tile flip it over onto the top of the cup and flip that Cup over onto the surface now I'm gonna lift this Cup I'm gonna go off to the edge I'm not gonna go straight up if I go straight up it'll drip drips down in now you can take see how I'm taking it it's coming out and I'm trying to get some streaks across there give a little bit more character I'm taking the rest of the paint and I'm trying to just get it out on the corners that'll mainly come off the edge so it's kind of ugly there it's gonna come off the edge this helps get all of that paint out and get it used up to get those corners covered now I gave it a little bit of torch and you can torch it before you tilt it or you can torture after if you tilt it I torched it before I tilt it you're gonna see here in a second I got much larger cells because now they're gonna stretch out as I'm getting it to each corner of in my kind of my hands my fingers help it to the edge help it to the corner and so I've ended up with some larger cells because I tilted it or I torched it before I tilted it if I would have just went ahead and tilted it and then torched after tilting I would have gotten a little bit smaller cells so that's one thing with flip Cup says you can torch it before tilting or torch it after and that would be depending on what size of cells you're going for okay our eight pink poor out of 20 it's gonna be a bottle cap paint pour and so this is gonna be the last paintin part for this video but right after this I have another video coming out and that's gonna have number nine through twenty in this video we had how to mix up our paint and what colors were using and then one through eight next video will have nine through 20 now right here I'm just spreading out the base layer so this one's gonna have quite a bit of that negative space that base colors still showing up and as I've said you don't have to have negative space just being white or black I'm using that aqua this light kind of teal color as my negative space here and then I'm gonna take a bottle cap and you can use a bottle cap you can just use a small cup you can use a bottle cap and you can use uh anything just real small you want a small amount of paint here you're not gonna want to put a lot down I use a cap to a Gatorade it's what I'm gonna use that's a nice size for this technique in this size of a tile take your bottle cap and you just want to take a little bit of paint on each of the popsicle sticks and drip a little bit down in that bottle cap you don't want a ton just enough for each of the colors so I'm Jake in a variety these blues and just I don't want to pour it in there cuz I don't want I'm getting a little bit of purple and letting it just come off into the popsicle stick and this is a real fun abstract look because you get a lot more of that negative space which is real nice for the eye sometimes if the surface is just too busy and too full of like a dirty poor or flip Cup with no negative space isn't always the most pleasing sometimes it can be really really nice and look great but sometimes you want it this negative space you're looking for a more of the solid color and then just a little bit of color going through it and these bottle cap pores are great for that because you don't put all that much in the book bottle cap so now I flipped it over on the surface and now I'm going to drag it across the surface and I am just feathering it up this is something you're just gonna have to practice because I'm dragging it across the surface I'm just lifting it a little bit more and a little bit more you don't want to let all of it go gushy if you just lift it up it'll all go gushing out at once you want to just kind of feather it out as you're dragging it across the surface and then I notice the one corner didn't have too much paint so I went ahead and took the bottle cap back to that edge and kind just drugged it off and gave it a little bit more paint for that edge all right so sometimes I blow those edges out this particular one I'm going for more of that minimal look so I am NOT going to go ahead and blow it out I do like kinda it's already given itself kind of an organic look to it it doesn't have straight edges that knots the reason I maybe would blow it out but I'm gonna go ahead and leave this one because I like just the minimal look without having too much there alright so thank you for joining me and that is one through eight in just a few minutes 9 through 20 will be out", "u04LVBt_zMQ": "good morning everyone jeremy here from

to be doing a christmas baking video so i'm going to be making two christmas treats with my grandma and my mom the first one is in [Music] m m like m m sugar it's like m m sugar cookie bars and the second one is oreo balls so yeah let's get right into it hopefully the recipe will be down in the description below but yeah let's get right into the video also wait before we get right into the video make sure you hit the subscribe button like button in the notification bell down below remember i am doing shout outs i don't have any shout outs for today but yeah let's just get right into the video all right so i decided that i would do a voiceover just because i thought it would be a little bit easier so here i'm getting out all the ingredients for the sugar cookie m m bars and i need we needed an egg the chocolate chips and then the m m candies so here we have all of the ingredients and then what we are going to do next is well first i had to get um something out of the oven so that we would be able to use that because we probably would need to use the oven that would be pretty helpful next after we got them and out of the oven we would mix together the cookie mix the butter the egg and then stir in the baking um chips and the candies so here i am just getting everything ready and stirring it all in well i guess pouring it in the bowl i'm not really stirring it quite yet but and then i cracked the egg which i'm actually pretty good at cracking eggs so that was pretty easy but um then i just poured that in and then it is mixing time one thing that me and my grandma definitely didn't notice is that it wasn't really dry for some reason because it only like the only really liquid was egg in um the egg and then the melted butter so it was a little bit dry but anyways um then we poured in the chips and then the m m candies and mixed those all up and then i sprayed the pan and it was actually really buttery which i was surprised by i thought it was just regular spray but and then we put it all in and it was nice because i got to use my hands i love to use my hands when i bake i don't know if you guys do but i love too and then what you do next is you add the m ms on top um the recipe will be in this the description below if you want to go check that out and then we set a timer for about 22 minutes and then um we were getting ready to do the oreo balls and i decided to eat oreos because we never buy oreos in our family um but for this recipe while the sugar cookie bars were baking we were getting ready for the oreos obviously so i got a big freezer bag and put in all the oreos we used like one whole pack of oreos and then like maybe five more but it was nice because i got to use like this cool mallet um when i was smashing it so that was that was pretty cool definitely but yeah then next i'm just pouring it all into the bag and i did i did sneak some because i mean why not i was caught so yes my grandma did caught me did catch me but anyways so then you're going to pour in the cream cheese which is i'm pretty sure it's just one bar i don't have the description i don't have the recipe in front of me but it'll be in the description below if you want to check that out to make it yourself but um you just put the cream cheese in and then what you are going to do is you are just going to get your hands and you are going to mix it all together um and i was a little bit nervous at first because my hands at the end were covered and it looked like i just put my hands in mud but it turned out pretty good and it was definitely pretty yummy here i am just finishing up mixing it and then i'm going to start sort of trying to put them in balls it was really sticky and so it was hard to make them into perfect balls but you can see later once they are chilled for a little bit um i form them into more ball shaped but there are the sugar there are the sugar sugar cookie bars we decided to bake them for a little bit longer because we had a little bit of trouble with um these so we took it out used the toothpick method and then it didn't seem like it was quite baked so we decided to leave it in there for a little bit but then this is a little while after we took it out and it was actually pretty good it is a little bit of a crunchy cookie bar so if you like crunchy cookie bars then i would suggest making that but um yeah and then what we are going to do is we are going to take almond bark cubes i'm pretty sure what they're what they're called but we took about six to seven and we put them in the microwave for a little while um and we are going to put that on the on top of the oreo balls to kind of you know form them together so we mixed them up and we decided that we probably needed to put them in the microwave for a little bit longer so we put them in the microwave and then i started forming them into balls and my dad had the great idea to wear gloves which definitely helped because my hands didn't get all sticky and messy so that was definitely really really nice so then i finished up forming them into balls and then me my grandma's first method was to take the oreo ball and like coat it in the white chocolate but that was kind of hard because it's like started falling apart sort of so we decided to just pour it on top and if we missed any spots we would put more on and then we put the sprinkles on and yeah that is it for the oreo balls i hope you guys all did enjoy this video um it was definitely a pretty different video it was kind of short but if you guys do want to make these go ahead and check the description below don't forget to subscribe like and turn on the notification bell comment any more ideas um any more videos you want me to do but yeah bye [Music] you", "nwSJjiDQ0OY": "every two-stroke engine that I've ever seen used on outdoor power equipment requires mixing oil with the gasoline to lubricate the engine even the four-stroke engine that still uses on some of their blowers and trimmers requires mixing oil with the gas the only exception I've ever seen is with some of the older Japanese two-stroke motorcycles they used an oil injection system but I've never seen an oil injection system used on a used on outdoor power equipment if you look in the owner's manual or operator's manual for the equipment you're using it will tell you what the correct ratio is of oil to gasoline for your engine if you if your equipment is fairly new it will say fifty to one or forty to one and if you're using older stuff it might say 32 to one what that ratio means for example 50 to one means 50 parts of gasoline to one part of oil and 32 to 1 means 32 parts of gasoline to one part of oil and in this video what I'm going to do is show you how to calculate the correct amount of oil depending on your correct ratio for whatever amount of gasoline you happen to be using probably the easiest way to measure out your oil to mix with your gasoline is to buy your oil pre measured out into these small containers if you mix this container here it's three point two ounces of oil with one gallon of gas it will give you a ratio of forty to one which is 40 parts gasoline to one part oil here's another example this container is 2.6 ounces of oil if you mix this container entire container with one gallon of gas it will give you a ratio of 50 to one and here's another example a little bit bigger this is from Walmart it's eight ounces of two-stroke oil if you mix this with three gallons of gas it will give you a ratio of 50 to one in this container you're getting more oil and what they do here is they give you a measuring cup at the top here and you squeeze the the container it pushes the oil into this measuring cup if you measure out 2.6 fluid ounces and you add that to one gallon of gas it'll give you a ratio of 50 to one and if you measure out three point two ounces and add that to a gallon of gas it will give you a ratio of 40 to one the problem with using these pre-measured small containers to measure out how much oil you need for your gasoline is it kind of forces you to buy your gas in like whole number units like one one gallon two gallon three gallon you could probably get away with buying like two and a half gallons and then you would use two of these and half of another one but what if you bought point seven gallons how would you know how much of this oil to add to your gasoline or what if you wanted to save money and you buy your oil in bulk say you buy it in gallon containers how much of that oil do you need to add to a you know like 1.9 gallons of gas so now I'll show you how to calculate exactly how much oil you need for whatever amount of gasoline you have and for whatever ratio you're using in this example I'm going to show you how to create a fifty to one gas to oil ratio that's 50 parts gasoline to one part oil I'm going to use it I'm going to do an example in gallons and also in litres I'm going to pretend I have 2.5 gallons of gasoline first thing you want to do is you want to convert your gallons to ounces and if you're working in liters you want to convert the liters to milliliters to convert to gallons to ounces I know that I have one gallon of gasoline has is a equal to 128 ounces of gasoline so I would multiply 2.5 times 128 that would give me 320 ounces so I have 320 ounces of gasoline then I would divide that by 50 because that's the ratio I'm working on if I was working on 32 to 1 I divided by 32 so I divide 30 320 ounces divided by 50 would give me 6 point 4 ounces so six point four ounces of two-stroke oil mixed with 2.5 gallons of gasoline will give you a 50 to 50 parts gasoline to one part oil or a 50 to one ratio you know it doesn't matter you know if you're working with you know 3.7 gallons you just substitute 3.7 in here if your ratio is 32 to 1 you just put 32 here and you would divide by 32 in this step instead of 50 now I'm going to do with the leaders you want to convert your leaders to milliliters one liter is equal to a thousand milliliters since I know that 2.5 times a thousand milliliters it means I'm working with 2500 milliliters of gasoline then I take that and divide it by 50 2500 milliliters divided by 50 will give me 15 milliliters so 50 milliliters of two-stroke oil mixed with 2.5 liters of gasoline will give you a 50 parts gasoline to one part oil or a 50 to one ratio in this example I'm going to be working on a 40 to one gas oil ratio so be 40 parts of gasoline to one part oil I'm going to be using 1.9 gallons in this example and 1.9 liters in this example first thing I want to do when working with gallons is converted to ounces since I know that 1 gallon is equal to 128 ounces I would multiply 1.9 times 128 would give me 243 ounces then I would divide that total amount of gasoline and ounces which would be 243 by 40 because that's my ratio and I would get it would give me 6.1 ounces so 6.1 ounces of two-stroke oil mixed with 1.9 gallons of gasoline will give you 40 parts gasoline to one part oil or a forty to one ratio if you're working with leaders if you have 1.9 liters you want to convert the liters to milliliters you know that 1 liter is equal to a thousand milliliters so 1.9 times 1,000 is equal to one thousand nine hundred milliliters of gasoline you want to divide that by 40 because that's your ratio 1,900 milliliters divided by 40 is 40 7.5 milliliters so forty seven point five milliliters of two-stroke oil mixed with 1.9 liters of gasoline will give you 40 parts of gasoline to one part oil or a 40 to one ratio using this method to calculate how much oil you need to add to your gasoline is it's a little more complicated and it's a little Messier because you have to measure out the oil but it kind of frees you up you know you can even purchase what you want you don't have to you're not forced to buy by your oil and those in those small containers you're not forced to get exactly one gallon or two gallon just it doesn't matter what your quantity of gas is as long as you have enough oil you can create whatever ratio you need if you have any questions just leave them in the comment section do my best to answer them and thank you for watching", "gBf8lCIKu88": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel if you are new here my name is Erica and I make videos all about making money on the side including reselling on eBay and Poshmark as well as making and selling candles in today's video I wanted to go over all about how to calculate fragrance oil percentage as well as to find out how much wax will fit inside of the jar that you're looking to fill so I did come up with a little bit of an equation if you will and this is just something that is not I don't think it's scientifically proven I to be honest you guys I am not very good at math I'm not good at science those were my worst subject in school I actually finished high school in the freshman at math class and yeah so that just shows that you don't have to be good at math you don't have to be doing math all the time to be able to make handles this did take me a few hours when I was first trying to figure it out I was sitting there and just trying to figure out the difference because there is that weight to volume difference in wax for the ounces so there's ounces in weight and there's ounces in volume and when you melt down wax so if you have a certain weight if you have 16 ounces of wax it does not make sixteen ounces in weight or in volume so it makes 24 ounces in volume so I was just trying to wrap my head around exactly how to figure out when I have a certain container how to figure out exactly how to fill that up in the correct so the formula that I figured out or I came up with is 0.66 7 times the ounces of your container equals the amount of ounces in wax weight that you need so I will be testing that theory with you guys today because I learned way more visually than I do by just seeing somebody write it on a piece of paper so we are going to all visual today I'm doing a complete demonstration on exactly what I'm talking about to see if my theory adds up so before we get into actually making the candle I did want to go over how to calculate the fragrance oil percentage for the amount of wax that you are using this does get a little complicated so I'm gonna try to break it down and as easy as I can for you guys I wrote down some notes so again I'm gonna try to put a picture or something in this corner just to show you guys exactly what I'm talking about so when you are thinking about adding fragrance oil to the amount of wax that you are using we're gonna use 16 ounces for this example and to be honest you guys I do everything in grams but I know that a majority of people do it in ounces so I am gonna be talking about ounces in this video to make it less confusing for you guys but again I really really recommend grams it's so much easier than ounces so that's just my spiel on grams anyways so we are looking at 16 ounces of weight for the wax so when you multiply that by 10% you get one point six ounces of fragrance oil which seems right you measure the wax you put the fragrance oil in there the only issue with that is now it becomes seventeen point six ounces of total wax weight which will increase the amount of liquid that you will have so you might have an overage of the liquid when you go to pour your containers so to alleviate that and you can subtract the one point six from the sixteen ounces that will give you fourteen point four but the issue then becomes you're dividing one point six by fourteen point four so when you divide number by number that will create the percentage of that number so when you do that you get eleven percent so if you're looking for ten percent what I typically do is if I'm looking for ten percent I'll multiply it for nine percent or if I'm looking for a nine percent I'll multiply it for eight percent so what I do in this case is I will multiply sixteen by nine percent that will give me one point four four so what I do then is I will tract 1.4 for by 16 that will give me 14.5 6 so 14.5 6 is now your total wax that you are using and then you're putting 1.44 of ounces of fragrance oil in it and that will give you a total of 16 ounces so when I divide 1.44 divided by fourteen point five six I get nine point nine ounces of fragrance oil and as a candle maker I don't necessarily have to have it it has to be exactly 10% or it has to be exactly you know I'm not exact with it it's just kind of a basic understanding of what you need to do to get it to be almost perfectly right I hope that made sense for you guys I'm gonna get into the demonstration right now and show you guys visually what I'm talking about with my example of my formula okay so now we're gonna start melting the wax so this right here this pile is actually soy wax and I am measuring or I measured out already just so I don't have to do it on camera I measured out fourteen point six ounces so I rounded up from the decimal point that's why I don't like using ounces you guys cuz grams is so much easier anyway so I'm measuring that out and I'm gonna put in one system smelt it down I'm gonna put in one point four ounces of fragrance oil in here so I will get back to you guys as soon as this is melted down okay so the wax is heated through all the way i heat it to about 180 degrees again that's another thing where I'm not too particular about getting it to a certain temperature anymore so I'm gonna take this out and then now we're gonna measure this fragrance oil so this is a little more exact than my bigger shipping scale right there so I'm going to get one of these little paper shot glasses essentially they're just like the little ones and they have the wax coating to them so it's not gonna seep through so I'm using mango papaya and I'm gonna tear this off so we're gonna do 1.4 ounces of fragrance oil because actually calculations is 1.44 so I got at one point for three I don't want to try to pour too much in there and mess it up so pour that in there and then I'm gonna stir it all together so I get these wooden skewers he's one like little kebab sticks and I just stir it all together okay so I'm done making this up so I got all these four these six four ounce tins so we're just going to start pouring these into these containers so that amount together combined with 16 ounces of wax so as you can see visually that made six four ounce tins so what that means is when you divide a 16 by 24 you get zero point six six seven so that's me says that 0.667 is the amount of weight of wax which will equal one ounce of volume of wax so what we're gonna do next is we're going to test out one of my 9 ounce jars so these are the jars that I used to sell so we're gonna do that same method to calculate to fill up one of these jars okay now we are going to test this theory with one of my 9 ounce jars so this is a nine ounce straight-sided jar I went ahead and whipped it and then centered it with the clothespin and we're going to be using at this movie theater popcorn so this is by the flaming candle I got this as a sample of one out sample months ago and I've never tried it out smells exactly like buttered popcorn so I thought I would give it a try in this fun little demonstration video so we are going to use the formula 0.667 times nine to figure out how much weight of wax we need to put in this jar so what I did was I multiplied 0.667 by nine and that equals pretty much exactly six ounces so it was like six point zero zero three or something like that so we're just gonna round it to six ounces so from there I did exactly what I did in the last formula where I multiplied it and I found out what nine percent was because I know that that will get me closer to ten percent so six times nine percent is 0.5 four so what I did was I subtracted the 0.54 from six that got me five point four six ounces so I was able to divide at point five four divided by five point four six and that got me nine point nine ounces so that got me right about that ten ounce mark that I want for my candles so I went ahead and measured again out five point four six ounces of wax and we're gonna go ahead and melt this down okay so my wax is done i heated it up to that like 175 180 degrees and now I'm gonna be measuring out the fragrance oil so because it's a small decimal point less than an ounce I'm gonna do buy grams like I'm used to so it's 15 grams so 0.5 4 ounces is the same thing as 15 grams so I'm gonna measure out 15 grams on here and this seriously smells like butter before tonight I'm gonna try to get exactly 15 sweet okay 15 Oh I'm going to pour this into here I'm actually gonna take the camera closer so this is how much it filled up after pouring that in there so at least a tiny little bit of space right there so I was kind of moving the liquor on so that's why it looks like that so this is what it looks like from my formula calculation so there you have it that is how I calculate how much wax to use how much fragrance oil to use I hope I wasn't confusing I hope this makes sense honestly and I know a lot of people might be thinking that this looks short from the glass itself but really from when I look at a lot of other people's candles that they sell I always thought that it had to go up all the way to this area right here of the candle but it leaves a really good area right here where it's just below that area where it starts to cave in I filled it up too far before and what it does is it smoothes out in one area but then there's a thin ring of wax that's still kind of on the sides from when it kind of overflowed a little bit so with this formula you get a really good even amount right there that you can consistently use for all of your jars so even if this isn't completely perfect I hope that it helps you guys and gives you a really easy formula to follow in the beginning and you can adjust accordingly depending on your jars and again I really hope this helped you guys please let me know and I worked really hard on it I spent all this time making all these candles and yeah just trying to have a visual representation of what exactly I'm doing and how exactly I make my candles so I hope you guys are having a wonderful day and have a wonderful weekend and I will see you guys in the next one bye guys", "DYluP0XDeDg": "welcome to Chris's bread today I'm gonna show how to make pumpkin pie it is very simple recipe you may choose canned pumpkin puree or homemade pumpkin puree for the pie crust you can choose my butter or shortening or mixed whatever you like let's get to it to make a pie crust put the flour and salt together mix it really well and you can use shortening or butter or mixture for shortening it's gonna be nice and like\u00e9 and keeps its shape very well I use the butter for the downside of the butter it was just sinking a little bit you may notice at the end of the video if you look at the pie the crust was sinking a little bit and using a pie crust mixer or if you don't have it you can use pork makes it really well until the butter it's like a pea size then add a cold water and mix it really well until it comes down all together if not coming all together you can add one teaspoon of water at a time once all comes together put it in a plastic wrap and put them all together push it down and then make like a disc shape and keep it in the fridge so it's gonna cool down and come little firm it's easy to roll meantime we're gonna mix pie filling start with the egg if you have a hand mixer then you can use a hand mixer to flop it up the egg if not you can use a whisk and it mix it really well then it other ingredients spices that makes it really well until sugar dissolve and then add pumpkin puree then condensed milk it's not sweetened milk it's a condensed milk and makes it really well and put it aside and now we're going to roll the pie crust and there is a fabric to roll the pie crust if you don't have this one you can use flat surface make sure sprinkle tons of flour so it's not gonna stick to the bottom and you can come down see the pea size butter close look and put flour sprinkle flour on the dough and then roll it nice and even size and measure the size of the round is you put a pie pan and see if it's like 2 or 3 inches from the top rim bigger and 2 ways you can put the crust on the pan you can fold it in the fourth or you can roll it on a pin and put it on the pie pan then gently press it down and trace the pie pan shape make sure not to tear the pie crust and some areas maybe it's long some areas you may come short then you can use a scissor to cut some and then patch the other and fold it fold the rim nice and softly now we're gonna shape the rim using our fingers so it's a knuckle and finger and kind of a all shape you pinch it and keep going and if your hand finger gets sticky to the dog then you can dip it in the flour and then keep tracing kind of an angled shape and I'm gonna show you how it's going to look like when it's done looks like this and to prevent the pie crust from popping we're going to use wait I'm using a black bean and foil on the top of the foil and to prevent the rim to burn use the aluminum foil to cover it up and that way you can put it in oven and cook it and we're going to cook the pie crust halfway and then we're gonna put the filling you can see that pie crust is sinking a little bit so put the filling make sure put it in the oven rack is the safer otherwise if you take it out it's gonna be hard to put it back in because it's a kind of liquidy and to prevent the rim from burning you wrap it with the foil again and bake it in the oven so take check the doneness you put a tooth stick or toothpick or knife to insert it in the center and if it comes out clean so that means it's done and now you know how to make pumpkin pie so enjoy your pumpkin pie", "vQLNS3HWfCM": "Toto.. I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. We must be over the rainbow! Now, I know we're not in Kansas...", "t5DPO55aIa8": "[Music] hi everyone Jeremy here from flower creations Linda asked what do I have that extended out my mic grinder or buffer so long so here is the answer to that so this piece right here I had to use these leather pieces that I made basically what this is is this is called a tapered spindle and there you have one for your right side and one for your left side what came on this originally is whatever diameter this shaft is it had some screw or just regular threads for a bolt and he's had 8 inch wheels on them for buffing but I knew I wanted to take these so this could have even been farther out but I only have this much room so what I did was I cut them off just enough for this underneath here there's basically this and it slides on over the the end and then there's two two screws right here similar to this they're just allen keys and just screwed them down and it locks it in place I cut that off with a hacksaw after I measured where I figured it would end up I put the tape on it so that whenever a fork or something comes off it doesn't get dinged up by those the Oscars the reason I get to is these buffing pads I got from Lowe's and they have I think it's a half inch or five a half inch I think yeah half inch so and for that it rides all the way up here and I don't get any compression so what I did was they just took a piece of leather cut it and then I used that to squeeze it up against so another piece of leather on this side now I'm solid this guy originally the hole was this big now it's gotten a little bigger it only goes on that far this one here's about the same but once you turn it on it's not one to stick anymore so this one here we go so I'm not quite done with this one yet I think I might put a spacer in here and then trying to run another piece of leather to get the rest of life use out of this so the way I do it is I have my black polishing compound from Lowe's I get a yellow one of these and a white one yeah here's the white one the white one that comes in a pack I think it's like nine bucks or something this one's softer than this one so this one here I use black polishing compound this one here the white one the softer one I use the red polishing compound and then I use the white on my last guy here so last one is a rope poofy guy I use a white compound on that and that really gives me a high shine now because this is only spending one direction you need your spindles to go in the opposite direction so one's gonna come this way the other one's gonna go this way so as you spin on so whatever that goes on there it's been in this direction if this one here was the same thread on the other side it wouldn't attach so they make a left and right side so what you need to do is figure out how big how thick the shaft is on your motor and then by the Arbor that is fitted for that so you might be able to have it a little longer but because MySpace I only had it small and that gives me four four spots the ones that I try and find now have the real small hole and that will go up and up but if you just wanted to replace them all the time I made it all the time and then if you want it together one so say I won't put this one over here you can do that with look guys the little hole and normally you'll just run one okay so that was about the grinder the buffer this piece goes to my thin nail drill this little guy here I'm sorry about the mess if you search on eBay for thin nail drill you'll get this guy normally comes in a kit it's like 50 some odd dollars I just super glue this to the top this is the second hand piece I've used for this I like this one so much better than the original the original was a cress thin you just take your piece you take your tips and you would just have to press it in with this one it actually opens up and then it closes so much easier so much easier on your fingers and it just plugs in to that right on the front if you go to my our website and flatware creations with two S's dot-com you'll be able to see on our tools page I have one of these listed that I found on Amazon it was about the same price but it had the right headpiece handpiece them as far as the motor goes that can be whatever but the handpiece is really the the main part of that and so I tried to match it the best I could I'm pretty sure that one will be just the same so I hope I answered your message and if you need any more help just let me know in the comments all right keep making have a great day if you're new to our channel please hit subscribe also

it's snowing it's sleeting it's raining here in Queens but we're about to make is gonna make all that go away so we make a lot of things in our instant pot or at least I do anyway right so it seems only fitting for me to make a recipe on this freezing and disgusting day in the instant pot that has the word pot in it now get your minds out of the gutter guys finally it's here we're making a pot roast and it's gonna be one of the most outrageous pot roasts you ever devoured and now you know I would never steer you wrong and I hope you know that by now so guys you're gonna see how simple this is how little prep goes into this I mean it's just a little bit of cooking time to make it super tender and divine so guys it's time to go to pot because we're gonna make the most amazing flavorful outrageous juicy tender astounding pot roast right in the instant pot instant pot roast let's go I want to begin with two medium yellow onions and then slice them up long ways and then into little wedges so we kind of have like a look like this going line see nice thick pieces let's set those aside alright guys so a key ingredient to a pot roast is a great cut of meat and a lot of people like using chuck roast I'm using a beef round or a rump roast for this I really like this for this it's nice and more bold as you see it's a great cut a chuck roast is good and so is it beef round rump roast and this is about three pounds worth so you can go between three to five pounds I feel like three pounds is the perfect amount and actually he's gonna make quite a lot on the will cook down four guys this thing's gonna be super super filling and just full flavor okay so now we want to do with our rump roast is we want to season it rump it sounds like a big ol til she doesn't it anyway what we want to do is we want to season it and guys there's gonna be a lot of seasonings going on here to make this thing so fantastic in terms of flavor so we want to do is we want to start with two teaspoons of black pepper one and a half teaspoons of kosher salt one and a half teaspoons of seasoned salt I'm using Lowery's one teaspoon of dried thyme one teaspoon of dried rosemary one teaspoon of onion powder one teaspoon of garlic powder and a half a tablespoon of dried parsley flakes and then just mix all that up together in our little mixing bowl here and then pour it onto a plate because it's gonna be easy this way to lay our meat on top of it and then make sure that we Pat all the sides of it so it's nice and coated and seasoned now I want to take my beef and I want to now rub it in all the spices and make sure we get it nice and good on both sides just really get all of it pretty much rubbed in should be plenty to go around you see that parts a little messy but it's also a lot of fun and by the way if there's a lot of excess fat on the roast which mine did not have you can either keep it there or you can just trim it off keeping it there will make more flavor happen though all the corners get all the edges and voila there we have it our seasoned delicious rump roast or chuck roast now I want to go to the instant pot and I want to add in two tablespoons of olive oil extra virgin so now I want to come down to the control panel and hit the saute function and it just saw them on the more the high setting on the dual plus by the way to adjust you just hit the saute button until you hit the desired temperature whereas on the duo series you hit the adjust button and let's give it some heat and let's let the oil heat up between two to three minutes in the pot and after about three minutes of the oil heating up in the pot let's take our roast in there and we're going to sear each side now we're gonna leave it on each side for about a minute and after about a minute let's flip it over the other side spear that one smelling great and after another minute of searing on the other side we're gonna take it out and then just transfer it back to a plate just like this and we are looking good and now let's focus our attention back on the pot I'm gonna add in one tablespoon of salted butter and I'm gonna quickly just mix that around in the pot so we can help you glaze all the spices that might be stuck on there so when we were searing the meat and this is butter is gonna help get everything up so to scrape the bottom with a wooden or plastic spoon not everything needs to come off at the bottom of the pot to be fairly clean by now alright and now let's add in our onions we're gonna stir that around in the pot we're gonna let that cook for about two minutes now as the onions cook they're gonna release some water because they're full of water as most things are even humans are full of water did you know that and so it's gonna help deglaze the bottom of that pot you see now we're looking pretty clear from what we or perfect we don't want it to be caked on with spices so it's important that you constantly start around that butter as it was melting as well as the onions when you put them in for a moment and you see once the onions have been nice and mixed around all the remnants from the seasoning of the beef are all coated in the onion as well as the olive oil and butter so it's going to be phenomenal so let's let this cook for about two to three minutes but you can make a pot roast that's wonderful what so wonderful first you Brown an onion also when I add in a tablespoon of sliced garlic and two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and that you can really be glaze the bottom of the pipe you see that nothing sticking now we're gonna let this cook for about another two minutes so all in all the onions about two to three minutes on their own and add the garlic and the Worcestershire sauce and then cook for another two minutes or so okay that's before we're finished here just make sure we scraping deglaze the bottom of the pot so it's nice and clean on the bottom but it really want any spices stuck on during this process okay now it's time to lay the trivet into the plot and leave the handles up and let's put our roast in now with clean hands and make sure the fatty side is up so the fat can drip through it and of course wash our hands after you've done that now I want to take a 6 ounces of sliced portobello mushrooms and lay them on top of our roast you can actually break them in half too if you want give you more that way there we go perfect and now I'm adding in 2 cups of beef broth as well as a cup of a good dry red wine like a Pinot Noir or something of that nature do not use red cooking wine for this use a good red wine that you would drink it's important for this and now we want to put some potatoes and carrots in there right but we don't want to put them directly in the pot because it might turn to mush so we're gonna put them inside of a foil wrapped bag that we're gonna securely create so I'm taking about a pound of baby white potatoes and I'm just gonna wrap it up in this coil there's my potatoes and then I want to take about 8 ounces of baby carrots and then do the same thing wrap them up nice and good and a little tin foil pouch will be created so I have my baby white potatoes here and then my baby carrots here lots of babies and now in our instant pot we should have plenty of room to put our foil wrapped vegetables so I'm going to put my baby potatoes right over here and my baby carrots right here just make them fit and it should be totally fine and that's it guys now we're ready to put the lid on top and cook secure my lid make sure I'm in sealing position okay and now that we're ready to pressure-cook let's hit the cancel button and now hit pressure cook or the manual button if you're on one of the older duo series and we want to go guys for one hour on this you see that on these pots that do a plus it'll say 1 and then 0 0 or as on the duo series it'll say 60 the right side on the duo plus our minutes and the left side or hours so one hour okay and be patient it's gonna take a little bit of time to come to pressure so don't worry and once the pin does pop up and it comes to pressure it's gonna stay on for about five more minutes before it begins counting down I'm while waiting for our pot roast to cook in the pot and since I had a crack open a bottle of red to make this recipe well Cheers I'll be busy for the next hour and now that we're done we're gonna allow a 15-minute natural release that means we're gonna wait until this reads 15 right over here this is minutes this is ours and the dual plus by the way and once that reads 15 then we're going to quick release so in other words we do nothing for 15 minutes except drink more wine and now that 15 minutes of a natural release have passed we're gonna finish it off with a quick release and our pin just dropped so let's take our lid off the pots and let's now carefully just remove our vegetables from the pot and then stir set these aside for a few moments come right back to these and there is our lovely pot roast inside of our pot well look at that and now look at how much more broth and sauce there is now did all the cooking alright so now let's remove our pot roast with the trivet nice and easy see how handy this TripIt comes in and then you can just flip the pot roast right on the trivet so we have it right laying on top of our cutting board perfection okay so let's let this cool for a few moments and move on to our next step so now I'm gonna come back down on my pot and hit the cancel button here and I'm gonna hit the saute button again and adjust or on the more or the high setting which it already is I'm gonna want to now focus my attention on the sauce and I want to thicken it by creating a cornstarch slurry so I want to take three tablespoons of cornstarch and combine it with three tablespoons of water and then just mix that up so it goes from like a cement light consistency to a nice smooth and creamy consistency just like that and there's your cornstarch slurry amazing thickening agent for any sauce and now I'm opening up my potatoes and look at that perfect right to the touch still perfect texture they're not mush what I want to do is I want to add it to the pot and I want to add in my carrots as well awesome and now that we're bubbling in the pot what I want to do is I want to add in my cornstarch slurry and immediately stir that around in the pot it sent me a lot of sauce guys it's almost like a stew amazing and I also want to add in a 1 ounce packet of a gravy mix if you want to it's optional and I'm using this all jewel one because well obviously it was on sale and all of why not again it's optional because the sauce already has plenty of flavor but I like to add it in as well give it a little bit more just give that all a nice good stir and let everything bubble in the pot for about a minute all right and once we're bubbling like that we can turn our pot off unless that the bubbles die down a little bit and guys let's look at this beautiful sauce full of potatoes and mushrooms and carrots and just an amazingly rich wonderful burgundy beef flavor mmm and you see how it's thickened up perfectly it's not too thick but it's not too thin it's like a wonderful glaze and I can't wait to pour it all over our pot roast speaking of which let's cut our pot roast up all right so our pot roast is gonna be super tender and it's gonna want to break apart which is totally normal as a pot Rose should so just take a good carving knife and cut against the grain and cut slices of it see this is cutting nicely I having a good knife here so there you go some pot roast right over here against the grain and you see that how it stays together perfect and you can just cut it into pieces if you want I like cutting my pot roast into pieces and then as you cut the pot roast add it to the sauce beautiful so nice so tender and you could slice it as thin or as thick really as you'd like I like it a little bit thinner but again take each slice here and just cut it up into pieces yeah look at how beautiful this is get every little last piece of that meat and let's add our final pieces of pot roast meat right into our instant pot now let's give everything a nice good old-fashioned stir and you're gonna see guys look at this it's like everything you'd ever want in a pot roast it's actually almost like a pot roast stew and I'm really okay with that because this is going to be insane look at the sauce look at how beautiful it is in terms of the glistening and the consistency and all this amazing pot roast meat with potatoes and carrots and dry and portobello mushrooms look at that a giant portobello mushrooms all right let's put it into a serving dish and serve it up all right now let's put some pot roast inside of our serving dish some mushrooms of course some more meat and of course let's make sure we get some of those carrots in there too oh boy and you know things shows everything so how about another potato will be here this is gonna make a lot by the way this will easily feed a family of four and maybe even six and you see that no mangled up veggies in this dish look at this see the potatoes still nice and firm to the touch but they're gonna be perfectly soft on the inside same with the carrots it's just the right consistency but they're gonna be oh so soft oh he has let's try some of this unbelievable pot roast out immediately oh look at this mushroom look at this board of elam ashur oh and look at this meat I can't even let's go all right guys here comes the moment of truth now let's just look at this meat okay look at that tender it is and how it just shredding apart let's just go for that first what can I tell you sometimes it's hard to find the words and sometimes it's only about an expression I mean it's almost like a stew mmm there's just so many amazing things going on in this right now oh boy this is incredible mmm Richard's trying to come in here he's like a dog in the hallway looking to pick up the scraps off the floor don't worry you could have your own bowl there's plenty to go around Richard tried this portobello mushroom how's that mmm give me some me too good one of these potatoes here let's try that I've been into it so easily and it's basically like a mashed potato with the casing at this point boom perfect oh my gosh oh my gosh that sauce from the pot roast mushroom mm-hmm and then again there's the meat itself Oh to die for you know what this Italian bread here is that are coming super handy when I lap up some of the sauce with it look at this watch this see that look at that see that right there mmm perfection it's unbelievable it's a perfect consistency Oh pot roast should be it's not too tough it's not too soft it's perfect yeah the sauce is so got a spoon I could like literally eat the sauce as if it's a stew it oh well an amazing an amazing absolutely fantastic pot roast pot roast ooh whatever you want to call it I'm just gonna call a pot roast because well it was a roast made in a pot but everything about it the textures the flavors the vegetables the meat a home run to the nth degree does

It\u2019s perfect for making layer cakes and\npipes beautifully onto your cupcakes. Welcome to recipes by Carina where I share\nwith you how to make classic and simply delicious recipes, make sure to subscribe or follow\nmy page for a new recipe each week. Swiss Meringue buttercream is a little more\ninvolved to make than traditional American style buttercream, both have their pros and\ncons and many people will have their favourite. Swiss Meringue is a more delicate, silky and\nmuch less sweet buttercream so to me it works best with flavours like vanilla where as well\nas the flavour you want a really beautiful texture to add to the cake or cupcakes without\nit being over powering. To start we want to seperate the eggs into\na heat proof bowl. If you would like the full recipe for this\nSwiss Meringue Buttercream it will be on my website as well as the full measurements listed\nin the description box below. This recipe will make enough for 12 cupcakes\nor 1 8 inch or 6 inch layer cake. Make sure your eggs are at room temperature\nand place the whites in the heat proof bowl and the yolks in a seperate bowl for saving\nfor another recipe later. I\u2019m just separating the eggs between the\nshells but there are many different ways to do this to make sure you don\u2019t break the\nyolk. We\u2019re going to be making a meringue so one\ntiny bit of yolk in the whites and it just won\u2019t whip up so make sure to be as careful\nas you possibly can. Place the leftover egg yolks to the side. These will keep in the fridge for a few days\nso make sure not to waste them. A few recipes ideas to use them up would be\nlemon curd, custard, mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce or adding them to your scrambled eggs,\nomelette or quiche for a richer flavour. To the five egg whites measure out a cup and\na half or 300g of white sugar. You\u2019ll notice I give the recipe amounts\nin metric and imperial, cups grams and ounces so no matter where you live in the world you\nshould find this recipe easy enough to follow. Place the bowl of egg whites and sugar over\na water bath or bain marie which is essentially just a pot of simmering water. This provides much gentler heat so theres\nno chance of over cooking the egg whites. You don\u2019t need to worry about eating them\nraw here, we\u2019re going to cook the whites to about 70 degrees celsius or 160 degrees\nFahrenheit. Using a whisk, give them a good whisk every\n30 seconds or so to make sure they\u2019re evenly combined and the bottom isn\u2019t getting too\nhot. As it heats the mixture will completely change\nconsistency from being incredibly thick and stringy to very thin and syrup like. There\u2019s no need for a thermometer here if\nyou don\u2019t have one, a simple way to check is to feel a small amount of the egg white\nand sugar mixture between your fingers, if it\u2019s smooth and you can\u2019t feel the grittiness\nof the sugar it\u2019s dissolved and the meringue is ready to be whipped. The sugar dissolves at about the same temperature\nthat the egg whites are cooked safe enough to eat raw. To make this recipe it\u2019s easiest to have\na stand mixer as it\u2019s hands free but you can also make this with a hand mixer. There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to make\nthis recipe by hand though as the meringue needs to be whipped for over 10 minutes and\nyou can\u2019t physically do that yourself at the speed a mixer can. If you don\u2019t have one I would recommend\npicking up a hand mixer, you can usually find ones that aren\u2019t too expensive and it\u2019ll\nmake baking a lot easier. Remove the egg whites and sugar from the heat\nand place them into the bowl of your stand mixer or the largest bowl you have if you\u2019re\nusing a hand mixer. Make sure you\u2019re using the whisk attachment\nhere and turn the speed to low. Your meringue will be very hot at this point,\nit\u2019s much easier to cool it down if you have a metal bowl as it won\u2019t hold heat\nbut I only have glass that fits my mixer so I\u2019m working with that. After a minute or so when the mixture has\nturned opaque white you can turn the mixer up to medium high speed. We want to start it off on a low speed first\nas this creates smaller bubbles meaning your meringue is more stable, once it\u2019s become\nopaque we can turn it up. As the meringue whips check the bowl often\nwith your hands to feel the temperature, we need it to be room temp so it definitely shouldn\u2019t\nfeel warm or hot. It\u2019ll take about 10 minutes to fully whip\nto the stiff peak stage on a medium to high speed, as you can see here it\u2019s bearly holding\nits shape and we still have a while to go. Once your meringue is at the stiff peak stage\nand is at room temperature we can start adding the butter. If it\u2019s fully whipped but still feels a\nlittle warm you can place the bowl in ice water for a few minutes and that should help\na lot. We need 1 cup, 2 stick or 225 grams or in\nother words a lot of butter. Make sure it\u2019s fully at room temp here,\nthat really important for Swiss meringue. With the mixer on low we\u2019re going to start\nadding a little at a time. While my butter was cold I cut it up into\nabout 1 tablespoon sized cubes which makes this part so much easier. Make sure each piece of butter has been fully\nincorporated before adding the next. It should take at least a couple of minutes\nto add the whole lot. Your buttercream should become a lot thicker\nand depending if you have as yellow butter as we do in New Zealand, change with a tinge\nof yellow. One quick tip here I have for you if you are\nafter a more colourless or whiter buttercream is to use the smallest amount of a violet\ncoloured gel colouring, it\u2019s the exact opposite on the colorwell to yellow so it completely\ncounteracts the colour. At this point there are a couple things that\ncan go wrong but it\u2019s usually completely fixable. I\u2019ve added my butter a little too quickly\nhere to show you how it may look a little curdled and separated. This is really common with swiss meringue\nand 9 times out of 10 will just be fixed by turning your machine back on to a medium speed\nfor a few minutes until it\u2019s silky smooth. Another common issue is soupy or runny swiss\nmeringue buttercream. This is usually caused by not cooling it enough\nbefore adding the butter so the butter will melt. To fix this place your bowl in the fridge\nfor 10 to 15 minutes before whipping again until you have a really spreadable consistency. Once your buttercream is looking pretty perfect\nwe need some flavouring. I\u2019m using vanilla here but you can use any\nother type of extract, essence or zest you would like depending on what flavour of cake\nor cupcakes you have. Add it to the buttercream and turn the mixer\nback on until fully combined. This swiss meringue buttercream is best kept\nin the fridge before you use it or it can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. In both cases let it come back up to room\ntemperature and whip it in your stand mixer or with hand mixer again before you use it. I\u2019m using mine to decorate this 3 layer\nvanilla cake. It\u2019s the perfect spreadable consistency\nand I can use a thicker amount between the layers to get that delicious looking cake\nwithout the buttercream being far to over powering to the cake.

mixture is cooled down do not put your eggs in a warm chocolate mixture or it will scramble your eggs it's a very simple recipe here is the second egg mix it and you don't need a machine to mix

parchment in it and i'll pour my mixture on it you can see there are only few ingredients in these brownies and they are very simple to make [Music] put all the mixture and now spread it better is thick so you will use a spoon to spread it and now you will bake in a preheated oven at 350 degree fahrenheit for 22 to 30 minutes everyone has different temperatures so keep an eye on it after 22 minutes i did the toothpick test and my brownies are done do not over bake your brownies and when they are completely cooled then cut them do not cut them hot brownies are ready they look fudgy tasty chocolaty let's make another recipe delicious and tasty snow cookies hi welcome to food delicious kitchen by sabha how are you doing we are making very simple and easy snow cookies my way in general snow cookies have lots of butter and made with pecans only i like to reduce the amount of fat without compromising on the taste and i use some almonds with pecans for more flavor these snow cookies are rich and nutty in taste and mildly sweet a perfect cookie on a chilly cold day and the bonus is these cookies taste great next day before starting the video if you are new to my channel don't forget to subscribe and press the bell icon button so you don't miss my future videos thank you let's start here are the ingredients for my snow cookies as you can see there are only six ingredients in the cookies and there is no egg i have one cup of unbleached all purpose flour i am using coconut oil you can use a stick of room temperature butter 1 cup of nuts these are almonds and pecans 3 tablespoons of sugar vanilla extract and we need some powdered sugar it is confectioners powdered sugar we will use it to coat our cookies as you can see you need only few items and the bonus is there is no egg in it in a dry pan add your nuts i have half cup of almonds and half cup of pecans you can use full cup of pecans if you don't like almonds i like this almond and pecan combination and we will toast them on a medium heat for three to four minutes they will not change their color you will just know when they will have a nice nutty smell in them and it will not take longer like 2-3 minutes so stay with your nuts otherwise they can burn i can smell they are well toasted so now i will put them on my cutting pad and chop them roughly if you want to have a nice fine job put it in a food processor and chop there i just like to chop them roughly so i when i bite in to my cookie i can taste nuts it's your personal preference if you want finer chop you can do it on the cutting board or you can do in a chopper this is how i like it now our nuts are ready for the cookies and when you toast them it gives an extra flavor in your cookies in a bowl i will add one cup of all-purpose flour this is unbleached all purpose flour in it add 1 cup of your toasted nuts [Music] 3 tablespoons of sugar these cookies are not overly sweet so you need very less sugar in it one teaspoon of vanilla extract i am using 5 tablespoons of coconut oil i melted it in microwave you can use up to eight tablespoons in this recipe if you are using us if you are using butter you can use one full stick of butter room temperature butter which is eight tablespoons but i like to use less as less as i can so i will mix it and if i feel i need more fat in it to combine the cookies i will add more right now it's five tablespoons [Music] these cookies will be crumbly and they taste fantastic and i like uh the thing about them is the next day they taste better than the first day i will add basically one and a half more tablespoons so total of six and a half tablespoon of coconut oil i used for my cookies and i'll mix it together mix it well until the dough comes together as you see there is not much liquid in it when the dough will come together we are done [Music] see when you press it it comes together so this is good for me i'll just squeeze everything together with hand you can do more with your spoon this way i know that my coconut oil is everywhere and it everything is well mixed [Music] these cookies are very good they have a good shelf life and you can keep them in refrigerator for a long time like for few weeks if you can keep them that long they are so tasty they just go fast i am putting a plastic wrap on my counter and i'll put all the cookie mixture on top i am putting it on plastic crab just for an easy handling but if you don't want to use plastic wrap you can use in the same bowl and now i will just try to make it together as you can see it's coming along you can make a ball in in the bowl instead of on a plastic wrap i just like it that way it's a little easier for me and now our cookie dough is ready i'll wrap it again we'll put it in the refrigerator for 45 minutes at least after 45 minutes we are ready to make cookies [Music] you need to rest your dough so when you make cookies they will come together easily [Music] and now you will make cookies i am making bite size cookies these are crumbly cookies i don't like to make too big because then they get messy when you eat them bite size is the right size you can make a circle out of it or sometimes i just make [Music] like this rectangular kind of shape i just like it it has more grooves in it so make all your cookies i'm showing you again just press in your hand two three times and it's there if you want a perfect circle you will have to do a little effort or make your nuts very fine then you don't have the problem of breaking it for me i like to make it this shape this recipe will make 23 cookies the size i was using bite size it will make 23 cookies i will put in a 350 degree preheated oven for 13 to 14 minutes every oven has different heat so keep an eye when they are done take them out and roll your warm cookies gently in powdered sugar right now cookies are very warm so handle them with cure or they can [Music] break [Music] warm cookies will take powdered sugar very nicely as you can see [Music] and now let them cool down and then if we need another coat we will coat them again with powdered sugar i don't think i need another one but i'll show you how to do it when cookies are completely cooled down this is how they are looking at this time if you want you can do a second coating on your cookies for me this much coating is enough so i'm not doing any more snow cookies are ready they are crumbly rich flavorful and delicious you can keep them fresh for four days on shelf in an airtight container and you can keep them fresh longer in the

icon button so you don't miss any future video let's start cooking these are the ingredients for our rice pudding i have half cup of rice basmati rice which i soaked overnight 1 3 cup of sugar if you like more sugar add more sugar 1 3 cup of almond flour i am using half and half and fat free milk you can use whole milk instead with cream kiera water it's for fragrance and cardamom powder which is also called elaichi powder it gives a nice flavor i am using a nonstick heavy bottom pan in it i will add 2 cups of fat free milk i like to have thicker rice pudding so i am using two cups of fat free milk and two cups of half and half if you want a little runny rice pudding increase the amount of your milk by one more cup but for me two cups of each is good [Music] in it i will add one teaspoon of cardamom powder i have half cup of basmati rice i soak them overnight i just think if i soak them longer they cook better in rice pudding but if you don't have time and soak them at least 45 minutes now mix the rice milk and cardamom mixture together and we will cook it on a medium heat start cooking this milk and rice mixture i'll add a wooden spoon in it so i can keep stirring it after every few minutes and it also prevents the milk from bubbling out of the pan and put the lid on it afterwards so you are not closing it completely after 10 minutes our milk is starting to warm up making gentle bubbles and rice will cook in the milk it will take around 15 to 25 minutes depending on your heat keep stirring it every five to seven minutes so you will not burn your rice pudding on the bottom [Music] after 20 minutes rice are cooked and milk is getting thick now is the time to add my almond flour i use almond flour because my kids don't like to eat nuts in the dessert and this way i have the flavor of the almonds but they cannot taste it i mean they cannot bite it and secondly it helps with thickening the rice pudding if you don't have almond flour 1 3 cup of almonds if you grind them they'll give you 1 3 cup of almond flour after cooking 5 minutes almond flour is nice and thick now i will add 1 3 cup of sugar in it i don't use too much sugar so if you like sweeter rice pudding add more sugar for me 1 3 cup of sugar was enough but adjust the sugar level according to your taste and now let it cook for seven to eight minutes when you put sugar in your rice pudding it leaves some moisture so let it cook and after seven minutes my rice pudding is almost ready at this time if you want to add any nuts add them i'll just add a little bit of water [Music] so i have one teaspoon of kera water and i'll put in it and stir around and i will cook just for a minute or so don't cook it long otherwise all the fragrance will just evaporate after cooling down this rice pudding will thicken a little you want this consistency of rice pudding use the fifth cup of milk like i told you rice pudding is ready it is a rich creamy and delicious dessert as you see it takes a little bit time and effort but it's worth it you will have a wonderful creamy delicious dessert to eat you can serve it at room temperature or cold or even warm i will garnish it with some grinded

time and the kids are [Music] hungry [Music] [Applause] so we're gonna get started on alfredo sauce you guys i am boiling water actually right here for the noodle the lasagna noodles so you might want to do that before or during whatever um but we are going to work on the alfredo sauce which basically what you're going to need is your butter so it's a half a cup of butter and we use the salted butter yes which is a full stick here so maybe not the healthiest recipe but you guys know it's gonna be good so half cup butter and then it says four ounces of cream cheese this cream cheese is eight ounces so we're just going to cut this in half and then plop it in yum so here we go four ounces of cream cheese going in bam plop a dot plop and drop pop and drop then you guys are gonna need one pint of heavy cream you guys know this is gonna be good it's got all the good stuff all the good stuff so you're gonna pour this in and then basically you're just going to melt it all together so is this kind of like making like an alfredo sauce this is the alfredo sauce so this is actually what i use for my alfredo sauce this is almost exactly what i do they copied you you copied me man me man me man e-man they copied me man you know what's funny is speaking of he-man i told ethan i said look up he-man and because i said you're totally he-man and he's all he looked up a picture of him because he didn't you guys know who he-man is you know okay he looked up a picture and he was like he almost has as big of muscles as i do i was laughing so hard he man shira remember shira yes yeah so by the power of grayskull okay i don't remember that part amen is that how it goes yeah so melting this all together you guys check this out oh wow so once this is all melted we start adding the seasoning to it and this is lip like i said this is pretty dang close to what i do the measurements are different like this one has way more cream cheese and butter than i normally use but this looks good what's the seasoning the seasoning is the italian seasoning which i don't normally put in mine um garlic powder pepper salt and then of course you have the parmesan cheese wow we've got this all melted down now so now we're gonna add the seasoning it's basically like a teaspoon of each thing so we're just going to kind of sprinkle this in boom italian seasoning garlic powder teaspoon of each i'm just kind of eyeing it and then you're going to do like a sprinkle of pepper and just a pinch of salt and remember tina loves salt she loves to even salt salt oh my gosh i try to be better now haven't been so bad wow look at that look you just mix that all together and then you guys if that's not creamy enough now you're gonna take your cheese parmesan cheese you could do grated it as well if you want but this is what i always use for alfredo this is the kicker right here um you're gonna do a cup of this so let's just pour pour that in baby and then extra i'm getting so excited oh my gosh okay so okay so okay so literally now this is all gonna just like melt down and be like nice and creamy and delish look at that guys yum all right so we just put the garlic in i just put like just a little squeeze of garlic paste in there you guys um it doesn't go over well with me too much danny is not yeah every time he has garlic it's an issue so i just put some in there and that should look at this guys check this out look how creamy that looks so good so delicious all right so we have the sauce here you guys look at that basically going to put a little bit of sauce in the bottom of your pan your baking pan oh is it almost like a casserole no okay but i mean i guess so you're going to just kind of spread that at the bottom then i'm going gonna show you the best part of this entire recipe okay so we got this just so we're gonna just set that aside for a minute and i'm gonna recall the best part of this recipe is eating it we'll see maybe it's gross who knows no so we've got our lasagna noodles we're gonna put those down first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna take the sauce and you are going to spread it on the lasagna noodles just like this okay just like this oh this sauce oh it smells so good okay then you're gonna take your chicken and you're just gonna kind of spread the chicken on there get your shredded chicken doesn't have to be rotisserie if you guys want to cook up some chicken or if you have chicken cooked up that works too and then after this you're going to do the bacon which we made our bacon extra crispy you guys because that's just literally the way to do it so let's break this up i just broke it up into little pieces and then we're going to roll this bad boy up roll it up up up roll it up up roll it up that's probably pretty filling yeah i bet one is probably enough yeah i mean you got chicken look at that wow see and then we're gonna put it right here bam and then we're gonna repeat that process this recipe it says it makes eight so you could double it or you know however you want to do it but we made enough just for the recipe so eight um so i'm gonna go through and just do the rest of these and put them in the pan and then i'll show you what's next all right you guys hello i totally forgot to put the cheese on the other one so after the bacon you gotta add the cheese you cannot forget the cheese tina what is wrong with you so you're just gonna sprinkle the mutts all over just like that and then roll it up i'm gonna unroll the other one and put some cheese on it but here we go [Music] wow that's literally like a little mini burrito it really is that's a pasta burrito that is a pasta bun oh look at that oh my gosh [Music] okay so it was totally enough for eight so here you go here's eight of them so now you're gonna basically take the rest of your sauce and pour it over the top and just kind of spread it around get it all up in there boom boom boom it's literally like a alfredo sauce enchilada i know chicken enchilada italian style yeah that's exactly it so i'm gonna just totally douse this and then we're gonna top it with cheese you guys okay now you just top it off with that mozzarella cheese or monterey jack sorry not mozzarella madre jack and then you are gonna put this in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes there you go that's easy peasy easy peasy you guys so we're gonna

when new videos come out hit that notification bell and remember to give me a thumbs up that lets me know that you're enjoying the videos and questions and comments are welcomed all right these are the colors i think i'm using there these are the ones i've i might grab some more but you know if they do i'll i'll try to remember rhyme down so let's go um i've had a lot of questions here lately about what's in my little bottle alcohol it's either 91 or 99 depending on what i got um isopropyl alcohol so that is what's in this and i do fail to say that so what i'm want to do i'm back and forth on do i want a background or do i just want white i think the background will help me a little bit so i'm going to do this now what i'm going to do is blue and green i want it very very very very light so i'm going to try to do that so i'm going to put quite a bit of alcohol here and i'm going to put only i think a couple of drops one and two now what would be a lot easier in this case is to go ahead and have this mixed up in one of these bottles and to load it down with alcohol um i have a lot of these i just don't know what colors they are so i need to redo all my stuff like that so i'm gonna swirl this around and try to keep it somewhat in a framed but you know every time i say that i don't so maybe quit saying that [Applause] god all right so there's that um now where's my moss we'll do the same thing with that i'm only going to do one drop because that two was just too much so okay so the top's gonna have some movement in it that's fine i'm gonna go ahead and put it on the bottom two then oh i do not like the fingers i usually get those when i don't have enough alcohol down and i'm just trying to make do that's usually when they show up okay i need to move on i've spent enough time on that background and i didn't get what i originally went for so that's just the way it is sometimes but this is fine i think it'll be fine i just i didn't want the background to be a huge part of it okay um think think think think okay i was going to do and i've got this smaller shot glass i think that'll be okay or do i want to use one of these no i'm going to use this because i'm only going to put a few maybe maybe five you know me in numbers um so what i'm gonna do is put down a little bit of alcohol and i'm going to do maybe a little bit of it one color and put another drop of another color and just see what they do i'm not going to mix them unless i see that it's not doing great and then i'll i'll do something okay flamingo and some bright yellow and some alcohol shot glass i'll do one here um put that down have your blow dryer ready because you're gonna need it yeah i didn't plan on doing that but it seemed like a fun thing to do let's see how that mixes [Applause] because remember when you dry the alcohol that's run out from underneath the glass the inside's still wet you can still blow it around a little bit and you've got enough of a barrier that oh no no no no don't do that um you can blow it around i didn't want it getting outside i wanted really really nice rounds so you know i'm i had wondered before if i could put some more pieces of paper towel underneath and make it to where i could push it down harder and it would kind of seal up a little bit better okay pull that off yeah so we're gonna have to doctor this up a little bit i'm still okay with it i just not kind of what i was wanting because i didn't want that but let's try it let's try what we had said about putting the extra down and see what that does it may or may not okay if it works it's fabulous if it doesn't we're no better we're no worse off all right i think probably the small ones would have been really cute but i've already started and i want all them the same so we'll just do this right there this time i think i'm going to do some purple these are bubbles but we're going to do leaf like things to maybe indicate that they might be flowers but they're still bubbles and just have fun with it no it's not doing it oh it's coming out good gum so either one i used too much alcohol which i didn't think i did i mean it is running to the outside like nobody's business all right i'm gonna do this i'm losing i'm losing my battle okay at this point i really do want to toss it but i'm not gonna because you just never know but i am disappointed okay keep going um i'm doing here a little bit quit running there we go all right let's see what this does i did put less alcohol and it's still running out geez so maybe the paper towels aren't a great idea in my head it worked out perfect [Applause] okay yeah all right now i'm gonna kind of let's just take that out do one here what colors do i want to do pink and yellow again of course i splatted of course why not i tell you this painting thing is ups and downs one minute you do something fabulous and you're like yep i have arrived and the next time that painting humbles you down to i need to take some beginner courses it's just amazing the uh the the difference in what these paintings do but that's all right we we know enough skills and that is where i'm like learn skills learn techniques we know enough to pull us out of this and that's what we're going to do we're going to pull out this but definitely learn your techniques because had i done this two months after i started out it'd little bit in the floor thrown away but now i'm like i've got so many things under my belt that i can usually pull it out or at least play enough to play and learn [Music] and that's that's what we want to do this i i don't know if i want to bother that or not but um okay and we'll do another one over here um i'm gonna do purple and pink should i yes i should do purple pink it's a little bit there a little bit there yeah this is this is getting messy [Applause] so [Applause] i want to fill up this white so when i put my own white in it it won't [Applause] it won't mess with it it won't make it look odd [Applause] and see how just having the shot glass arounds created a perimeter it will run over it but you stand a better of a chance not to okay so let's let's go to the next thing um and we'll leave those alone for a minute i'm a little mad at them um okay so on the acrylic part i'm going to do these two the sap green which matches the moss really well so we'll do some of that and we'll do some blue because those two go together really well i'm going to do i'm going to go back and forth here so i'm going to take my card do a couple i'm going to do some like a straight for the stem a little bit more than that okay i really want them touching but i'm not going to because you know that's neat um okay that's all i'm doing right now what i'm going to do is take a flat brush i so had it just right there what in the world oh there it is okay i'm going to do maybe some grass things i'm not going to worry about doing leaves but i want to do some little grass things and i'm going to do it where i'm holding my brush straight like this and then turn and then come back like that and instead of trying to paint like this do your whole arm it just it's for me it's easier to do something like that um these are now i'm gonna get these dry first okay now we'll get some of that we'll start over here i need some more of this so that was pretty easy and we'll do one this way i don't know this one i can see what i'm doing coming toward me it's a little harder but it may be just an angle i think they're about the same and we'll try one side by side well yeah i do i do want to try one side by side let's do this i'm gonna start out thick that's really bright really bright wow okay i didn't want that right there i like the little bigger blades all right that's all i'm doing okay back to the card um i want to do some just messy like that do yeah i like making it go up into that okay so let's tackle those things so i'm going to have to use some more colors um white no let me think what i'm gonna do yeah white ink where's my white acrylic now if i want them to be white which while we're doing this craziness might as well um i need to spray it let me think if i'm gonna do anything else no okay i'll be back i'm gonna go spray with kmart varnish now hold this if you if i sprayed really close it's going to activate this somehow it will splotch it up and it's no good stay 15 18 inches away you know i just kind of stand there and missed it so try that if you're having trouble with it and i'll be right back okay i am back so i've got it dried and okay let me just i'm gonna do black and i'm gonna do white so i've got my white here uh this is my black bombay i don't know that i want to use bombay we've got that black cinelier cinelyer i never knew how to pronounce that okay so i got that so here's the two all right all right so i'm going to stamp on them with my shot glass um we'll clean it off real quick and then i wanna i think i want to um shadow it with black okay that's clean i need a bigger piece of paper all right there we go it doesn't have other colors on it okay all right let's do it i don't want it gigantic and stop be wet but i do need something there yeah so we'll do let's see this one i'm gonna put over it now don't be too alarmed when you see it it drawn up it's it's sitting on something that's not accepting it now so now it's going to be a little um beady it's going to beat up a little bit now if you don't mind it being like the color that you're putting it on it kind of pulling some of the purple or yellow then by all means don't spray it and then just put the white over it because it will influence it a little bit and that's a cool look too i just you know made a choice and went with it i kind of want these a little after i said i don't want them dark i do want them dark i definitely want them visible now i'm just going to do the white highlights um like here and that's what i'm talking about it beaten up it's but you know this that's where you make a call and kind of go with it yeah it's easier when you just do it and not try to fix it like i was doing there okay so there's that i didn't want the white to take in all the colors so i sprayed it but now you know it acts differently so i like it i'm fine with it i just want you to be aware that those are the options on it now i'm not sure what to do um i want them to look like bubbles really do so i want this highlight to be a little now once this acrylic has started drying it actually is taking on more acrylic a little bit easier so that seems like a good way to kind of correct that if that's not something you're wanting yeah i'm getting okay with that all right ah you know i just don't know what else i want to do um i could double wipe those but i think i'm going to leave them i really do i think i'm going to leave them and just make them look like they kind of did their thing i do want to splatter of course what i kind of do is want to take some of this yellow and pinks and purples and maybe splatter here not here or at least not right now so i'm going to take that and we'll do something i don't want to do half but i want to do about a little bit cover up a little bit more than half that means what kind of yellow do i have okay i need to add things to my list so no black and then it comes off yellow [Music] pink and purple so we're pulling some of these colors here but very lightly okay so here i don't have this purple i don't know why i thought i ordered it i thought i thought but apparently i do not so i'm going to mix mine some will take the blue that i've been using and believe it or not that hue of blue will pull in that purple so i'm technically still using some of my original colors there's that and i'm going to put this magenta beside it and then i'm going to put magenta over here and then i'm going to do my yellow here we'll mix these two and that blue took over and we'll scoot some over here i'm not going to color all that okay close yeah okay so that's the purple ish so i probably won't use a lot of it yeah it's not showing up much at all so i've got a little bit of it down there okay we'll screw it up just a little and put a little bit but not much like it's fading up into it i just don't want a sharp line that's kind of cute do i want even more um more than having more i would like bigger yeah i like that so i like the bigger ones not a lot of them just bigger okay that makes that makes it fun um in return i kind of want to do blue up here leave leave kind of a space yeah i don't think i like that as much so i'm glad i didn't do much um i do want some of the blue up toward here not much at all in fact i want it real blotchy so i'm going to pat off i had to have one going through a flower okay i like that i'm learning to stop i'm so excited i do but i do but i do want and i'm going to have to get a bigger brush if i want some more um bigger splats so i'm going to use a mop brush love these um yeah they're they're absolutely incredible i'll try to remember if i don't already have them in my i don't think i do um gosh love them not i need more water it was pretty thick that's all i want that is all i want okay i'm gonna look at it to my camera and see it's kind of cute all right yep i think i'm gonna stop i think i'm gonna stop all right y'all go have fun", "c_13347icMI": "recreations I was just working on some wind chimes and I thought I would share it we all get these beetle on or the other wire they come in all kinds of stuff but they come with these little peepers plastic things and there was a pain and the getting in the way and get kicked so what I started doing is taking and drilling a little hole and an angle coming out this way so what that allows me to do just run my my wire through that flip it on here I got a look at what I'm doing here we go now I can take and kill this right off there just phone just quick tip hope you guys I'll have a great day and I wanna see you know", "3A8hl4Pz2Pc": "hi my name is Nick husband aka from coffee detectives calm and today we're going to address a ticklish question which is how much coffee how many how much coffee grounds should you add twist certain amount of water when you're making coffee in a drip Brewer I'm going to address this because in the question and answer area on the site that is by far the most frequently asked question and when we get into this you'll see why there is it's the coffee maker manufacturers do not make it easy for you to figure that out so here we have a black & decker a mid-range drip coffee maker there's a water reservoir in the back there's a filter basket in the top a carafe deflector a coffee and the heating plate at the bottom to keep it warm so you buy this and I'm not beating up on Black & Decker all the other manufacturers will do the same thing to you so I gave my I take out the little how-to guide and I looked through a figure I want to figure out how much water should I put in here and Hammer how much coffee grinds should I put in here to make a nice cup of coffee well when you read through what it actually says is it says fill up on the back here up to the number of cups you want and there's a little things about four six eight ten twelve same as our same as on the carafe here but when it comes to coffee grinds it says add coffee grinds to taste in other words no use at all so they give you this little scoop here which is a little coffee scoop but again there's nothing on here that tells you what it is or what the capacity is now in fact fortunately I know that that is a standard sized coffee scoop and contains two level teaspoons to them tablespoons of coffee grinds when you fill it to the top level so at least I know that bit now we'll come back to here the for the six the eight to ten how many cups of coffee well is confusing because if I take my kitchen measuring jug I fill it up to two cups and I pour it in there it actually comes up to about 3 and 3/4 cups so these don't correspond to what you might think of as being an actual cup the next question is and let's assume now that somewhere you found maybe on the coffee detective side or from a neighbor or whatever you find out that actually what you should do is have one coffee scoop per cup of coffee so on the face of it looking at this if you're going to make age you'd put 8 of these in but of course you wouldn't because these markings don't actually correspond to what a cup is certainly in the kitchen and what kind of cup do you want do you want a little cup of coffee do you want like a regular mug of coffee or do you want cereal sized mug of coffee because depending on what kind you know what the amount of coffee you're going to make is going to depend on how much water you put in here and how many coffee grinds you add well that's the very greedy that's not enough and I think a lot of us when we get up in the morning like a cup of coffee now the rule of one level coffee scoop of grinds per cup is based on the premise that a cup contains six fluid ounces but it doesn't that's the one that contains six fluid ounces that's about eight fluid ounces and that's a little over ten fluid ounces so things can get complicated because if you just try and follow the manual which is no real help or follow some abstract instruction you can end up with a brewery the cider brewer that's either too weak or too strong so I'll tell you what I do eight fluid ounces not six so instead of doing a level scoop do a heap scoop it gives you just that X bit extra that takes you out from the six to the eighth so if I go make if I gonna drink my coffee in this and I think to myself okay I'm gonna have you know I want to have four cups of coffee over the next two hours which is probably excessive but possible then I want four times eight ounces of water and I want four heaped scoops what I'm suggesting is that you ignore these markings altogether and you can't go by these markings either unless you go on the side here I mean in fact if you're using this that is in fact one cup here is eight fluid ounces so that's actually a pretty good match if that's the case what I'm going to do to fill the water I'm not going to use the carafe and try and use those measuring bars I can either fill this up with water four times and pour it in or I'm going to fill this up to the two cups level and put it in twice so I know that I got enough water for four cups eight fluid ounces each so let's say I'm going to have four cups I put in four times eight fluid ounces into the reservoir then I get my ground coffee we've got what do we got here community coffee ground dark roast very nice coffee and I'm going to use those big scoops so here we are I've got my filter paper in place which I'm going to put in there you're your brewer may have a permanent gold-tone filter and that's fine too and so I just happily put in one two three and in fact doing I doing a heap scoop is much easier I'm quite generous with it because I quite like a dark brew so there we go I put four or four heat coffee scoops in the filter four times that in the water and now I'm ready to go you", "xaTfSaUYY9g": "all right welcome to today's video on today's video we're going to take venison trimmings and turn them into a traditional summertime favorite and that's hot dogs again much like the summer sausage there are some advanced techniques here but we're going to give you the knowledge along with the tools that we have here from meet your maker you're going to turn out a delicious tasty hot dog now in this case we're using venison along with pork fat we know fat is flavor and we're going to tell you and teach you how to marry these two together so you get that nice juicy bite hot dog with hot dogs one of the things that really makes them so special and really even makes them a hot dog is that they're very finely ground or the meat particles are reduced to really you can't even feel them when you bite into them very hard to do without the use of a bowl chopper ie bolt cutter where you actually emulsify the meat however by using the grinder a technique that includes using ice we're going to grind these through until we get a nice smooth texture then we're going to put them in our mixer we're going to mix them to get that protein extraction and then we're going to stuff them um we're going to be using a cellulose casing this is a 28 millimeter cellulose casing basically just means it's plastic that casing will be peeled off at the end after this product is cooked so stick with us as we tell you everything you need to know about how to process and turn out a tasty traditional hot dog using wild game i know you guys have some meat in your freezer from last season this is a great thing to make especially if you have little kids everybody knows little kids are super picky eaters and a hot dog is usually one thing that most kids will eat so if you're looking for something to make the whole family can enjoy follow along and make some hot dogs i'm going to point something out else out here too so what we've done is we've taken and we've kind of made a habit out of um thinking for the future and we want you to do this too we've taken and we've separated our lean trimmings and we've already vacuum sealed them using our meat vacuum sealer we have the chamber back we've we've sealed these up and we've put them in convenient bags now we've got two and a half pounds pork fat written on the back of these so we have these nice lean cubes still partially frozen that's really how we want to begin our processing process cubed up nice and you know uniform and something that we've been asked about in some of our recent videos and we want to address is if you have deer or or gay meat that's already been ground up it's already been processed to the point where um that that initial step has been completed where it's ground you can use that product um to go ahead and and and do this process it's the the really the tough part about that is you don't know exactly where your fat content is in this case you know this is very lean almost zero less than five percent and we know we're just going to add the five pounds or 20 percent of pork fat to it so that's that's the one variable you don't know when you already have it ground up if it has pork fat no fat whatever obviously you can look at it but you certainly can start with product that was previously ground and frozen to get to this point right here but in this case we've we always prepare for the future not knowing you know maybe we make a batch of hot dogs when we initially process but we don't know how quickly we'll go through the hot dog so we hold some of this product over in the freezer with the intention of down the road further processing it and that really makes it convenient on processing day too because you know rather than put the pressure on yourself to get everything processed right at the time of harvest you can preserve for the future in the uh in the vacuum sealed bags you can go into the freezer the stuff's going to remain perfect just like the day that you harvested it and it certainly is safe and acceptable to freeze it defrost it rework it and freeze it a second time certainly no concern there now that i've got my meat all blended up in this tub i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to add my seasonings once again what we like to do is point out that you can take any shaker of our bearded butcher blend seasoning and the ratio that you mix it to is 6 ounces to 12 pounds of meat so in this case having 25 pounds of meat i can go ahead and take this and dump it right into my lug the form of two six ounce shakers dump it right into my mixture in fact i'll mix that around a little bit start to fold that in we like to mix our spices into our trimmings and then grind we get a really nice blend that way so two shakers for 12 total ounces in this case we're using original beer to butcher blend seasoning these are hot dogs that we make for our store here and they're delicious and we can't get enough of them now one of the things to point out about the cellulose casing it's non-permeable it won't accept any flavor from the oven smoker cooker whatever you're doing you certainly can use a collagen casing even a sheep casing good luck with those if you decided to use those but we want to get all the flavor into the product because when we cook it it's not going to accept any flavor we're just cooking it because of the cellulose casing in addition to our 12 ounces of beer to butcher blend original we have got four mount four ounces of fresh minced garlic we love garlic in our hot dogs and we've got four ounces of our natural hickory smoked powder that's what really gives us our nice flavor yet still on the counter we have the one ounce of sure cure we're not going to add that in until our final mixing so as the smell starts to hit me my mouth starts to water and i start to think about how delicious this product is going to be now that we've thoroughly hand mixed it's time to go ahead and start dropping this through our number 32 meat grinder all right quickly before i um start grinding while this is nice and clean i just want to go over real quick um how easy this thing is to assemble disassemble i know we've talked about the different components a little bit with changing knives but i just wanted to point out just because one of the things about the the meat equipment is super easy to clean and super friendly i do want to point out this bushing right here you see how we have this all nicely oiled this bushing right here make sure that when you assemble and reassemble that you have this bushing this plastic bushing goes inside your worm here then of course you've got your extra storage on this plate we didn't talk about much but this would come into play it's called a kidney plate because it looks like a kidney and traditionally in the in the commercial meat industry we use these uh grind out like things like pork fat so we can make lard maybe we'll get into that someday but you get the kidney plate it's really nice to keep everything but yeah this goes back in very easily it's just got a nice it's all hand all hand tightened so yeah bushing goes inside your grinder head and that worm's just gonna go in there and you might have to you might have to turn it just a little bit to line up the shaft looks like i'm lined up really nice of course your plate and of course we're starting with the course head for our first grind that's going to line up right here on the bottom it's recessed once you get to that point you're just going to thread this on like i said all by hand no tools required that sets on there we're ready to start grinding all right friend friendly reminder we like to start with a little bit in there these these grinders they don't like to sit there and run dry so once we have that started then i can just reach around flip it on and away she goes and by a way she goes i mean i gotta stick with it or else i i even set my plunger aside because like i've mentioned with this stuff um being as cold as it is and then in um what we would call sort of golf ball size pieces is just gonna chew right this number 32 grinder is going to chew right through here especially with uh with the 10 millimeter of the 32 or excuse me the 10 millimeter 3 8 inch plate you can see it this is where the plunger would actually go if i need to but i'm just as quickly as i can get two handfuls set up here and dropped in it takes it which is really nice because if you've ever worked with a grinder that doesn't have this capability it can get frustrating in a hurry seth wanted to just stand and watch but i said hey i need another set of hands here because like i said literally as fast as i can feed it this grinder eats i think i can handle this portion only problem is he's going to start micromanaging now older brothers i tell ya i was just gonna mention how nice the the fat consistency was in that meat and that's gonna blend in even more and more as we go there we have it grind uh grind number one complete through the 3 8 inch plate now we're going to change plates go for grind number two through our 4.5 millimeter or 1 8 inch plate okay grind number two hit me up [Music] this is where you're gonna employ like i mentioned before a little bit of that cat fall method where you want to kind of just get it get it moved into that if you're at all worried about my fingers i mean this guard is here for a purpose if you look i mean my fingers are still at least four or five inches away from the and obviously if i'm gonna push it any further i'm gonna use uh i'm gonna use the plunger just because never ever wanna remove guards from your pieces of equipment they're there for your safety all right so grind number three you know as this blade is in here cutting against this uh grinder plate it's reducing our our meat and fat particles again and again and that's what a bowl chop or a bowl cutter will do it will continue to reduce the particles and really what those have is they have a blade that spins at a terrific rpm like it depends on the model but up to 6000 rpms per minute or revolutions per minute but in this case we're replicating that process by using the grinder the grinder knife um and really that's just to get that real fine texture to our hot dog as you can see it's being reduced and the in the mixture is becoming more and more uniform now this being grind three we're going to use a trick and we're gonna because a lot of these recipes will tell you that you want to grind once through the 3 8 and twice through the 1 8 but we're going to go for at least one more grind after this and we're going to use a trick to get it through there if it if it needs a little help because as you work this meat down it a couple things will happen um one that you'll get friction obviously with all the the grinding and the meat will warm up and you just simply can't have that it's still cold now so the trick we'll use will take care of that and the other one would be that it just doesn't want to find its way um through that plate so we've got a trick on the next grind that's going to help you get that fine consistency that we're looking for all right this is doing so well that we're not gonna use our secret trick which is ice until um until we get to we're gonna go for uh grind number five so that was the end of grind number three want to beam me up no go ahead you're gonna find you're gonna find yourself at this point you're gonna be doing all sorts of uh you know you might even find yourself singing a little work tune like here we go a grinding for the fourth time because this is when things only stick to butchering not singing things slow down you can do the the drop you can make little bomb sounds like but you're you're definitely going to uh get slower and slower in fact we might be slower on the fourth grind than the fifth grind just because we haven't brought the ice in yet you can see the consistency of the product now we're getting real starting to get protein extraction really reducing those particles you do not want your hot dog to look like a sausage um in the sense where you have that real you really don't want the definition of the the particles to be seen in the hot dog all right that's it for grind number four now and this is where i'm going to change my gloves even just to shut this thing off because your protein extraction starts get going and anything you touch the stuff sticks to time uh it's a good time to point out that you don't have to use a binder like um a lot of times you you'll find a commercial operation so use like a non-fat dry milk powder to get the stuff to bind together but in this case because the way that we're grinding we're getting proteins that are binding together so now in fact i'll just show you right here what we're going to do is we're going to take we're going to just we're going to literally just dump in two and a half pounds which is 10 of you know just your store-bought ice or whatever and we'll mix that in handmax that in and when we grind it in it's actually going to help us this stuff's still nice and it's cool it's not quite as cold as when we first started still nice and cool but that's going to do two things it's going to bring the temperature back down if the friction's got it warmed up and then it's also going to help punch this through here for the last and final fifth grind so let's mix it up and get started look at you johnny on the spot with my gloves you mean you've had gloves this whole time and haven't told me duh we're in the rockies yeah so we can just fold those ice cubes in and then the grinder will grab it pull them through as we go big big thing is is just to have faith at this point because things are going to slow down that you want to just stick with it it's well worth it to get that product in the end because like we mentioned traditional style ballpark juicy soft kids will eat them people will say those can't be deer and you'll be like yeah you made them yourself yeah this is the point where you have to put in that you know a little extra effort just stick with it and we shouldn't on this final grind having this meat equipment is a huge benefit to this process because without this type of equipment does not happen without nope all right round in uh third well-rounding third we're at home plate pretty much this is grind five as you can see we really don't have any uh particle definition or not much at all just know from experience we would not get this through another time and frankly why would we want to try commercial product is going to get to uh almost toothpaste consistency it really will look like cake batter so this puppy right here amazing that went fantastic it it's not it's not hot it's not tripping any fuses it's not doing anything like that we ran it um for the better part of uh 40 minutes or so cycling through these grinds obviously they slow down as you go along so now what we're going to do is we're going to put it in the mixer and we're going to mix for eight minutes that's the point we're gonna add our cure we're gonna add a little bit more water that's going to pretty much finalize our protein extraction and then we're going to the stuffer i'm going to show you a convenient way for you to link these hot dogs you just have to stick with it and you'll see that in a minute but mixer next let's get going meat matrimony that's what we have we married our mixer to our grinder it was super simple we just took the mixing head off put it in a lug put the mixer on now we're going to load up our 25 pounds hot dog mix like mentioned we're starting to get some protein extraction but we're going to work it a little bit more and that's why we have to have the mixer we're going to be adding our cure in this step and working it for about eight minutes and we want to reverse every minute we want to reverse the direction that we're mixing one ounce of pink cure going into our mixture with what with wild game we always used to look we like to use sodium nitrate versus the celery juice powder just because you know you have a little bit higher risk of bacteria with wild game versus commercial there we go i'm just putting one bottle of water because we have the ice in there i'll take a look at it and after we mix it maybe halfway and see if we need any more water so one minute one direction one minute in the opposite direction we'll do that about eight minutes four times each way so got the next generation great part about this is scott has his son brady and i've got my son luke oldest boys and we're teaching them how to do this as well so next generation that's one of the great things about working with this stuff is the family fellowship that you get while you're working with it i did decide to add my second bottle of water just because the texture was getting pretty firm so that just just means that it absorbed the more lean meat that you have in it the more water it can actually absorb um and with venison it can it can take quite a bit that's how commercial processors really uh they use like lean bowl meat and that's how they can get it to really take in a bunch of water so with uh wild game you can typically get uh you know quite a bit of water in there you don't want to overdo it but in this case it definitely needed it all right we're done all right all right all right that's going to be the word for this video all right so i can just pull this out this stuff it's got that nice tackiness and we unplug this son of a gun because last thing you want is to have your hand up in here messing around and have the unit power on safety first get this dug out see how we got that protein extraction get it loaded into our 15 pound mixer stuffer and then comes the fun part stuffer stuffer 15 pound stuffer see i do serve a purpose here now is when things get real quiet because the power tools are no longer in play obviously a 15 pound stuffer stuffer we can fit um you know a little over 50 into this so we'll fill it up in the first round try to get that air pushed out of there as best we can manually and then seth will show you how it works on that end of the now what we do is we put the stuffer inside here we start cranking down and as mentioned in the summer sausage video there's an air release right here so as this pops up you can see it pop up you push down with your finger and it'll you can actually hear it it'll release that air so you can see the products coming through this horn it's nice that these horns are clear that way you can see where it starts and then we're starting to come out of the extrude out the end so you want to hold your thumb and your forefinger up against that casing making sure that you don't allow any air into it as you stuff watch your casing real close down here towards the end you don't want to squirt too much product out of the stuffing horn and not have enough casing so when it gets down here to the end you'll just reverse crank your stuff for a little bit and it'll stop did i hear you say you're going to invite me over tomorrow night for a hot dog gross you heard right you said something about uh when i said shooting challenge i said there's nothing better than uh hot dogs over campfire i meant it so i want you to come over tomorrow night and i want to challenge you to a shoot off an archery shoot-off so you're going to hold your bottle of seasoning on your head and i'm going to shoot it at it now you're going to go first just so you know and then i will hold my bottle of seasoning on top of my head and you can shoot at it we're going to be planning a funeral for you about probably you no i'll challenge you to a shoot off you want to do it yeah all right you heard it weenie roast and uh archery shoot off i'll have my bow tech in hand there you have it now what you want to do at this point is you want to just it makes a nice comfy bed no i'm joking so obviously we've got um a bunch of really long hot dogs here and you can you can um there there's going to be talk about twisting people say you can twist this way and then you can twist that way and and quite frankly those untwist and they become uh again one big long hot dog so we're gonna show you the european method of tying seth and i do it a little bit differently um i do it the correct way he does it the incorrect way no anyway i sense another challenge there's no wrong way but i start by twisting my first heart hot dog and then in this case i i portion out like another size and i twist like this and then i come up and i go through and roll and then i'm i'm left with a bunch of three hot dogs like that he's going to tell me he loops and swoops and goes through and i think his is actually the correct way but what we've got then these are going to be um and obviously depending on what length you tie at but eight hot dogs make up a pound because we're using the 28 millimeter cellulose casing um if you want a smaller hot dog you can obviously use a smaller millimeter casing these are available on amazon and other butcher supply stores we buy obviously big bags of them you don't have to do that you can get like what do we do less than two strands here make up uh about only about one one strand one in uh one and a quarter to get these 25 pounds through and these are appealable casings so once we remove them um and and we better uh illustrate and slow down for one of these because somebody's going to be pausing this like heck ready here's how here's how i do what he does i take my thumb and forefinger with my right hand and i pinch and then i pull this loop through just like this get it to the length of hot dogs that you would like and you pinch twist turn these two and then repeat that process again so you just keep doing that you twist pull the next strand up pinch pull it through twist pinch pull through and so on and so forth and as you get speedy at it you can just like that so now you can see those are all tied up ready to go 25 pounds venison hot dogs at this point we're going to hold them in the cooler overnight obviously for you that would be a fridge or some place where you want to keep them cold the reason being they have sodium nitrate in it they do not have a cure accelerator we want to let them sit overnight let all those flavors mesh together let that cure work these are going to get this beautiful um red color when we cook them and so to cook them we're going to do the traeger 885 basically a smoker now should be mentioned these are non-permeable casing means no flavor from the smoker is actually going to go into this casing we're not going to get any smoke flavor from the traeger however it's going to be a great way to cook another thing with hot dogs is they'll mention a lot of times you watch some of the recipes about humidity control traeger is great at that whenever you cook foods in it they um they retain a lot of the moisture and again these are plastic so no if you were using collagen you have to worry about humidity but there's no humidity loss so we're going to hold them overnight put them in the traeger cook them ice bath peel them put them over the campfire see you then sounds like a good time to me let's do it [Music] [Music] it's time to get these hot dogs on the tracker these sat in the cooler overnight they're starting to get some nice color when we put them on this traeger they're gonna get a beautiful red color going man what a day this is beautiful out here sun shining scott and i got up this morning we got a five mile run in wow felt great so i'm just going to start laying these on the rack and we want to make sure that the best that put them on here the best that we can so that they don't touch because if the hot dogs touch they'll uh they'll cook unevenly there so we want to definitely want to try to spread them out get a nice little space between them and just go back and forth top and bottom see how we do we may have to split one of these just to be able to get them to all fit so this is 25 pounds and i think it's going to fill up this ironwood 885 pretty well we can come back out and turn them after a couple hours or so we're gonna do um two hours at 165 two hours at 185 and then go ahead and crank to 205 if we need to just to finish them off so now they're all on there let's go back through and make sure they have just a little bit of spacing get that heat up between those hot dogs i think that looks pretty good don't forget your meat probe kind of probe them so with the meat probe you always want to go in the thickest portion because that's what's going to cook the least amount and typically when you tie these like this it's going to be right here in this in this end so probably what i'm going to do is start here then i'm just going to run that probe up right into the end of that hot dog just like that we're going to let these go and we may come out part way through rotate them in just a little bit so that smoke gets around the hot dogs real nice and then we will um keep an eye on our tent see you soon it's time to check on the hot dogs we ran these at two hours 165 degrees we ran them for an hour at 185 and then we ran them for an additional hour at 205 totaling four hours on the traeger 885 so let's crack the lid let's take a peek there you have it i see some very nice color throughout doesn't look like there's any part of the hot dog that's not cooked so at this point what we're going to do is remove our probe i see you finally decided to get out of your chair last time so now now he wants to be with this the ice bath for the hot dogs but instead it's going to be an ice bucket challenge now he wants to be a part of the process so now what we're going to do is we're simply going to take the hot dogs since they've met internal temp of 165 and we're just going to dunk them in an ice bath this is gonna help stop the cooking process and it's gonna they're gonna cool very very rapidly so we're just gonna go right into our ice bath got the bottom rack done time for the top rack so there you have the hot dogs in the ice bath we're gonna let them sit here until they get nice and chilled and then we're gonna peel the casings and get some in some vacuum bags using the meat vacuum sealer the chamber vac and we're gonna let them sit the rest of the afternoon in the cooler and tonight we're gonna have a campfire so stick along come along we're gonna have a good time practice this do this one no i'm not holding an apple on my head hot dog beautiful stack of venison hot dogs here hot diggity dog wanted to demonstrate real quick to peel all you need to do is make a very slight incision right here and then this casing will just uh peel right off so that's what we've we've already peeled all these hot dogs so we wanted to show you the finished product wanted to talk to if you get any what we call fat out where a little bit of your fat may leach out into the case you see a little bit of my thumb right there that's perfectly normal perfectly fine you can wipe these puppies off or you can even use a little bit of lukewarm water to to rinse them off but shall we absolutely let's take a look at the cross section and see what we've got you want to do like we did with the summer sausage and cut it and then reveal it yep let's do that so here it goes there's the cut there's the hot dog so there we go we've reduced those fat particles to uh you know a very fine amount there and that's that's the goal with hot dogs so that's going to give us a nice soft bite there's another one there um i think the only thing left to do is give these puppies a taste test we cold hot oaks for breakfast all the time so oh my nice texture wonderful flavor that hickory smoked powder that we put in there those are amazing delicious um obviously we use the two shakers of the beard butcher blend seasoning for the 25 pound batch of hot dogs i want to remind you you can of course get the bucket which is a total of 12 shakers if you're gonna do a lot of these that's something that you're certainly going to want to do now that we've got our hot dogs and our vacuum pack only thing left to do is take these over here seal them up with our meat chamber back here comes my favorite part there you have it venison hot dogs now you can pop these in your freezer in this case they're not gonna make to the freezer we are taking these bad boys down to my house for a good old-fashioned hot dogs over the campfire i can't wait so just remember that when you do vacuum seal these these would be good in your refrigerator for up to about 30 days other than that just toss them in your freezer when you want to pack pull them out thaw them and they're ready to go but like scott said next time we're going to try these is going to be on a hot dog stick around a campfire good times coming stay tuned let's head to scott's house let's get some cooking over the campfire [Music] do [Music] welcome to my humble abode i gotta get my bow put a uh schooling on stuff there's my dog where's my big green egg there's my cracker that's where my bows hanging see if he's ready to go out here getting ready to get his butt whooped you ready it's about time you show up to the park both shooting identical bows bow tech revolt x's so we can't blame it on equipment it's going to be on the shooter it's very windy out here gold tip arrows it is pretty windy so whether you want to account for that these bows do shoot pretty fast so um so 30 yards there's uh a beer to butcher hot blend with my likeness on it and a beard butcher cajun blend with his likeness on it i'm gonna be shooting at my blend he's gonna be shooting at his blend see who can put one least amount of arrows to put one right through your through your bottle let me show you something though see all those marks inside my hat i brought my lucky hat those are deer that i've killed wearing this hat one two three four five six seven eight hmm i recommend everybody go to our website get one of these lucky hunting hats i don't have a lucky hat but yeah you go first go hold your bottle on top of your head i'm totally changing it up you go first okay your lucky hat will protect you you do it no you do it your lucky hat will protect you all right i'll do it chill out oh i can't balance it on my head i'll just hold it yeah don't eat anywhere in the region of i don't want to i don't want to get your hands because you still got to be able to butcher meat after this is all done you didn't really think we were going to do that did you all right put it on the string no i'm not going to make you do that what do you want to say 100 bucks to the guy that puts the arrow through his bottle just just for bragging rights i'd say just bragging just bragging rights who whoever puts their arrow through their bottle the other guy has to carry the most weight in elk quarters out of the mountains all right who's going first you ready i'm ready i'll let you go first revolt x let's see what we can do hey guys did you notice the wind much i'm not giving away my secrets we're going to go check it out oh i gotta give it up for him he got him right through his own logo and i'm oh man that's incredibly close it couldn't be much closer that was the first shot that wasn't any retakes no gimmicks oh i gotta get one shot look at that first shot each and seth takes

next time see [Music] ya you", "LPQaFB-yIBI": "what's up guys today we're going to make a sicilian style pizza that's a sheet pan style pie that's got a pretty thick crust we're going to make the dough using a 50 hydration pre-ferment called a biga that's the first step in this whole shebang so let me show you how to make that so i'm going to grab an eighth of a teaspoon of yeast that looks about right then i'm gonna add it to 265 grams of all-purpose flour a little quick mix here with my hand okay yep that looks pretty good and then into a large mixing bowl just like that perfect i'm going to add 135 grams of room temperature water and then to start mixing this i'm going to use a fork just to get it going and once i have a little bit of this water incorporated into the flour i'll just kind of switch over to my hands this looks good just like this so i'm not trying to incorporate all of this water into the flour this beak is going to be really shaggy looking we're not trying to knead this dough at all there might even be some some extra flour left over in the bowl and that's totally fine okay all right this is done and this is what you're looking for okay something like this i'm going to grab a container here with a lid okay and then i'm just going to transfer this bigga into the container this stuff here good slap a lid back on it now i'm going to let the vegas sit at room temp for about 15 hours timeline wise you know make the vega the evening before you plan on baking pizza then it's ready to go to make your final dough late morning early afternoon okay all right we're magically into day two of making our pizza and that's what the vega looks like when it is ready to go you can see that the any loose flower has been absorbed and the biggest kind of puffed up a little bit okay so i'm going to add this to the mixing bowl just kind of pull it out and drop it in your bowl so i'm going to add 185 grams of room temp water along with 15 grams of sea salt just like that i'm gonna add 215 grams of all-purpose flour and another eighth of a teaspoon of instant yeast here we go now let's get the bowl on the mixer grab my dough hook get that secure now i'm going to let this mix on medium high speed for a solid 10 minutes that's going to give the mixer the opportunity to kind of beat up the dough and really activate that gluten you'll know the dough is ready when it's nice and smooth okay all right see how smooth that dough is that's perfect all right let's bring this over the table and get it out of the bowl all right i've got a lightly floured table here and i'm using a bench scraper these things work wonders so pick one up if you can beautiful i have lightly floured hands i'm just going to work this dough around in a circle until it forms a nice compact ball yes perfect nice and smooth just tighten this up a little bit with my bench scraper and then i'm just going to drop it in the lightly greased bowl and i'm gonna slap a lid on this thing cover it up for a few hours until come on boy get on there until it's doubled in size okay and through the magic of video production we have a dough that's ready to go looks a little more jupiter than saturn but this will work out just fine that looks great yeah nice so i've got a 14 by 14 square pan here you can also use a sheet pan a rectangular sheet pan i'm just going to drizzle a little bit of olive oil maybe a quarter cup and then spread this around just making sure the bottom of the pan is completely covered there just going to transfer the dough over into the pan making sure i get as much of it as i can out of the bowl here come on baby almost there there that looks great make sure my hands are nice and greased now i'm just going to use the tips of my fingers and kind of push this out a little bit the gluten still needs to relax so you're not going to be able to get this all the way to the edges of the pan but just do do your best to kind of spread it out as much as you can right now initially okay that's good working from the center to the edges here all right that looks good for now take some foil or some plastic film and just cover up the sheet pan and let that dough relax for a few come back to in about 10 minutes and just continue pressing it out and stretching the dough to the edges of the pan all right this is looking really really really good here you can see in the corners that the dough might not quite meet the edge and that's totally fine okay totally fine as the dough proofs and rises it'll fill in on those in those corners so don't sweat it at all now i'm going to cover this back up with my foil and i'm going to let it rest at room temp for another hour and a half or two hours until the dough is doubled in height then we'll just top it with a bunch of yummy stuff and bake it off but for now let's go ahead and make some pizza sauce all right the first thing we need is a little bit of heat then we're going to add a 28 grams of extra virgin olive oil say that's about fat tablespoon right there next we're going to add about 17 or 18 grams of minced fresh garlic give that a little stir there i don't want to burn the garlic we just want to kind of sweat it maybe lightly toast it okay next i'm going to hit this with uh a couple teaspoons of dried oregano oops yeah wow smells good i love the smell of that garlic cooking all right next up we're gonna add a decent amount of tomato paste in here just for a little deep flavor notice that my garlic is just toasted lightly this tomato paste will also help keep that garlic from burning and now we're going to go in with 794 grams of crushed san marzano tomatoes give this a quick stir here just to incorporate everything i'm going to season the sauce with about seven or eight grams of fine sea salt that's about a teaspoon all right let's give it one more stir just to incorporate all those ingredients that looks good cook the sauce for about 45 minutes to an hour let those ingredients cook and mingle together and it'll be ready to go i'm gonna put a lid on this just to reduce any splatter and we'll step away and let it do its thing all right it's been an hour and the sauce has thickened up nicely wow that looks great cool so i'm going to kill the heat slide it on the back burner here and let it cool off until we're ready to top our pizza all right guys let's take a look at our dough i think we're ready to go here yes so this dough here has doubled in height for the most part there's some areas that are a little lower than others maybe i didn't do a great job of making sure the dough is completely even all the way around the pan i don't know it's going to turn out great though i know it is so the next step here is i'm gonna add some cheese and then some sauce and then our toppings i'm gonna start with some mozzarella some full fat low moisture mozzarella i'm using deli sliced mozzarella here at my store they call it sandwich thickness so it's about a pound and there's 16 slices so i'm just going to lay them out overlap them slightly so you get about four across and we're going edge to edge all the way to the edge of the pizza again slightly overlapping four across four down nice this is looking great you can probably hear my convection oven thumping away in the background there sorry about the additional noise but i need my oven nice and hot nice and hot there beautiful so now we need to hit this pizza with some sauce here's what i made earlier and i'm just going to be kind of fast and loose with the application all right the theory of cheese before sauce has to do with keeping the crust from getting soggy from the sauce so you'll see it a lot in pan style applications push it around a little bit again doesn't need to be need to be perfect by any means yeah that looks good fantastic i'm going to go for a meat lover's pie here today i've got some pepperoni that i've sliced and i'm just going to go ahead and just litter this all over the top of the pie not going to be shy here i'm going to go full on the meat that looks pretty good now i've got some sweet italian sausage that i've cooked off just gonna sprinkle that around a plethora of meat here we go and then after this i've got some some ham some sliced ham that i've chopped up make sure i get it all the way around the edge here all right now i'm gonna finish this pizza up with some freshly grated parmesan cheese you can be pretty liberal with this i'd say i don't know i'm probably throwing a third of a cup on there something like that yeah that looks great perfect though now i've got my oven preheated to 450 degrees it's convection so if you're using a conventional oven set it at 475 i'm gonna bake in the middle rack for about 20 minutes [Music] all right guys oh man this looks ridiculously good wow amazing all right i need to get this on a rack for a few minutes just to let it cool off so i don't burn my face off trying it okay so let's do this all right that looks great all right guys i'm done waiting i got to give this a try yeah so i want to cut this into nine pieces so i'm just gonna go uh nine equal pieces oh yeah been sitting for five minutes and it's still got a really crispy crust on the bottom you switch hands here not that ambidextrous with a knife but okay moment of truth freaking delicious this looks so good here we go oh yeah oh my god that's so good [Music] it's got a nice crust on the bottom but yet the dough on the inside is super light and airy it's so cool it's it's wonderful flavors it's all coming together it's a true meat lovers pizza i can't believe how crispy the crust is on the bottom even after the pizzas rested [Music] anyways guys if you haven't subscribed yet consider subscribing if you like the video of course check out some of my other pizza making videos leave a comment below tell me what you think does this look good to you let me know i'll catch you next time [Music] so good", "IlpALhO3BQw": "how many Ounces are in a slice of pizza [Music] for example Domino's Pizza which has four outlets in New York said it's typical serving which is two slices weighing a total of 5 and 1/4 ounces has 344 calories and 5 grams of fat Pizza Hut a nationwide chain with outlets in New York City said a four point four ounce slice has 253 calories and 9 grams of fat you", "PVyQjxwuOeM": "[Music] hey folks hope you're doing well hope you keep in safe and this week we're gonna actually be making an assortment of cannolis well technically only two and cannolis are italian pastries which are tube shaped shells of fried dough and then they're filled with delightful deliciousness and when i first heard of cannolis i kind of thought of something else and me being me you know cannoli right and i know what you're thinking just just run the clip already [Music] [Music] so we're going to be actually doing two types of cannolis today so we're gonna do a lemon curd and ricotta cannoli maybe mixed in with a little touch of mascarpone and then in addition we're actually gonna be making ourselves a coffee and chocolate cannoli as well so obviously making that pastry in the dough and then we're going to fry it off i'm going to show you how to do that as well so very straightforward right now straightforward maybe but we're going to enjoy this i hope you guys and gals will so if i've convinced you feel free to hit the subscribe and the bell button for notifications when videos are uploaded but always appreciated so i think it's time to crack on sit back relax and i hope you enjoyed the video so we're going to need to start making that cannoli mix first as it needs time to rest so we're going to need 250 grams of plain or all-purpose flour which is about 2 cups and sifted in addition we want 2 tablespoons of fine granulated sugar or caster sugar 1 pinch of salt in addition we want 40 grams of unsalted butter which is 1 8 of a cup and then you want to get your hands in there and breaking down that butter incorporating it into the flour and the sugar using your thumb and index finger so after that's incorporated we're going to need one egg and also four tablespoons of masala wine which is gonna be about 60 mil [Music] without stumbling and drinking all the masala mix the dough together until it binds and if it doesn't quite bind together you can always add a little touch more masala right no i think we better go with water this time so add a little splash of water until the dough binds together but be very careful it doesn't go too sloppy and once bound together we're going to give it a need using our heels of our hands for about five minutes until smooth so once that dough is nice and smooth we're gonna clean it put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes to rest so next we're going to make the lemon curd and we're going to juice two large lemons these ones are smaller ones so i've gone for three lemons so we're gonna zest them through a microplane first also don't forget to take the stickers off always super important and also just bearing in mind when you're zesting make sure you zest and turn zest and turn do not go into the white that's the bitterness and then you want to juice them and you could use a sieve to catch the pips i'm using the back of my microplane next you want about 100 grams of caster sugar or fine granulated sugar which is half a cup next you want to add five and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted butter and then in a separate bowl you want two eggs and one egg yolk whisking them together so grab the lemon mixture and take it over to the stove to a pan of simmering water and we're just going to lightly whisk that together just until the butter is melted so once melted add the egg mixture into the lemon mix and then continuously whisk that gently just until the mix has thickened and cooked out the eggs so once the lemon curd is thickened up we're just going to take that off the stove and then we're going to carefully pour it straight through a sieve into another bowl ah watching your fingers because it's very hot so once that's finally passed through pop a little bit of parchment over the top just to stop it forming a skin did i say parchment i i meant to say cling film but you could use either i guess but once this cools down we're gonna pop this in the fridge and let it set even further so next we're gonna do the mascarpone and ricotta and we're gonna need 227 grams or eight ounces of mascarpone and then we want 227 grams or eight ounces of ricotta as well then we want three tablespoons of icing sugar or powdered sugar and then just carefully whip that together using a whisk and you could use a kitchenaid if you want to i'm not going to use it today and you was expecting me to use the kitchenaid so once that's stiffened up you can pop that in a piping bag you don't necessarily need a nozzle so you might be thinking that seems quite a lot for all these cannolis considering we're doing two i'm glad you asked because we're actually going to split this in half and then add some coffee powder so we got the coffee cream for the coffee and chocolate cream technically ricotta and mascarpone you know what i mean and then we're going to go for about a teaspoon of espresso powder i suppose you could go for more right um maybe a little bit more and if you're feeling a little bit wild just a touch more don't add as much coffee as i did one teaspoon is sufficient enough and also half a teaspoon of cocoa powder because it is coffee and chocolate right so once all your fillings are into piping bags pop them in the fridge so it's now time to roll and cut those beautiful cannolis but before we do that because i'm always forgetting something oil your rings or well well technically oil your tubes okay i don't think i'm making this better for myself am i so the only thing i can say to that is i can only apologize and also if you've got some cones hanging around maybe we can do some cannoli cones so now it's time to roll out that beautiful dough so we're going to dust the work surface lightly with some flour grab your rolling pin and give it a good roll out until you've got a nice thin pastry so once the dough is almost transparent but not quite we're going to start cutting them with a 9 centimeter ring which is 3.5 inches and we're just gonna cut them out now i know i said nine centimeter i'm going to go a little bit of an upgrade and go a little bit bigger with the ring so about 10 or 11 centimeters i'm going to try these ones instead so we're going gonna have some small ones and also some medium-sized ones as well and keep the leftovers you can re-roll this and make some more after that so grab yourself a little bit of egg wash as this will be for sealing the tops so carefully wrap the pastry around the ring and then just put the smallest amount of egg wash on the top just so it can seal and stick together so when these fry they won't unravel and all you're doing is just making sure you pinch it as well making sure that seals up a treat so once they're ready to roll well technically they're already rolled you want to heat yourself up a thousand five hundred mil of peanut oil or six cups if you haven't got peanut oil you can always use vegetable oil that's fine and you wanna heat it up to about 350 fahrenheit or 180 celsius so once the oil is nice and hot we're going to carefully drop down those beautiful cannolis and we're going to cook these for about two to three minutes until nice golden and crispy so if you haven't sealed them correctly this is what happens but the ones that you have sealed correctly they'll turn out nice and crispy perfect so once you've finished cooking turn the heat off set the oil aside and let this cool down for a good few hours until it's nice and cool and if you want to reuse it again pour it back in the bottle once it's nice and cold so without losing too many you should get quite a few out of this mixture and i also found maybe put one in at a time and using that spider to hold it in place for the first few seconds and you're probably cooking time is not really one or two minutes i would probably say about 30 seconds until they're golden and crunchy so now these are finally cooled down let's start filling them so starting off with the lemon curd and ricotta just pop a little bit of that lemon curd in the middle there without it drizzling out too much and then just carefully pipe the ricotta just on top and then you want to fill the coffee and chocolate and i guess you could put some chocolate droplets in there but we're going to do something else so going back to the lemon curd and the ricotta mascarpone we've got ourselves some very finely chopped walnuts and we're just going to dip the ends straight into there and then as for the coffee and chocolate garnish we've actually got ourselves some dark chocolate here which is about 100 grams or two thirds of a cup and we've also got ourselves 100 grams of white chocolate or two-thirds of a cup what we want to do is just dip the ends into the chocolate and then just drizzled with white chocolate very finely over the top without making too much mess so there is our two lots of cannolis which turned out an absolute little delight i think it's time to try these little bad boys so the chocolate and coffee and also the ricotta mascarpone with the lemon curd so here we go chat oh my goodness me the lemon curd and the ricotta and the mascarpone mixing together that crunchy cannoli and then finishing nicely with those walnuts oh my goodness me also i may have um made a mess but it's okay it's fine maybe we could change these two mesoli's now for the coffee and chocolate one this time be careful of the ends coming out it's like a chocolate mocha delight goodness me the creaminess the ricotta the crispy cannoli the chocolate the coffee oh my goodness me it is an absolute little treat and you've got to give this a go you can't miss out on this so there we have it for this week our delightful cannolis with the ricotta mascarpone the lemon curd and then you've got the ricotta mascarpone mixed in with the cocoa powder the espresso powder and then drizzled off with white chocolate and dipped in dark chocolate oh my goodness me you gotta give this a go you won't be disappointed feel free to check out

you ever dreamed of having persons served in a hotel room in Paris I am going to give you my secret for is my recipe you will succeed [Music] join me on my journey to making the perfect buttery and flaky croissants combine water and yeast meanwhile mix flour sugar and salt together homogenized with the liquid yeast then incorporate the six and a half tablespoon of softened butter into the mixture continue kneading when just combined transfer of the dough to your work surface without additional flour use your palm to smash the dough and fold it in half and smash it together again the croissant dough is kneaded after the initial mixing both to realign the strands of gluten that have began to develop and to strengthen them to form the network structure of the dough kneading whether by hand or machine is a way of mixing the dough by stretching it which is what makes the gluten Network stronger intro dust your work surface and the dough with flour deflate the dough and Pat it into a rectangle shape rabbit and refrigerate overnight now how to make a slab of butter here is my secret weapon just place the 16 and 1/2 tbsp of butter in a 7 by 8 inches plastic bag and shape it into a slab once chilled prima of the edges to take the bara slab out when the bara slab is soft enough removed the chilled dough from the refrigerator now in a floured surface roll the dough into a 15 by 7 inches rectangle place the softened butter slab on one half and fold in the other half tape the dough gently with the rolling pine then roll from the center out until you have a rectangle 24 inches long by 8 inches wide when you have reached the proper size sweep off any excess flour then fold the left corner 2/3 of the dough up to the end almost fold in the right corner and readjust the thickness of the fatone fold in half like a book you have now made a double turn called to do blue repeat the same step and roll out until you have a rectangle 24 inches long by 8 inches wide fold the left third of the bottom up to the center and the right third over that you have now made your simple turn wrap it up and refrigerate for 1 hour meanwhile to make a perfect egg wash crack two eggs and blend them with a pinch of salt when the dough is rested shaping the croissant using half to do a time chill the other half making sure the croissant dough is always cold while working with roll it to a rectangle 18 inches long by 9 inches wide 1/8 thick which is about three millimeters with your chef's knife divide the dough into 6 large croissants roll them giving it that beautiful and familiar look repeat this with a remaining dough and place the croissants on a greased parchment paper brush them with egg wash you can make the croissants ahead of time and refrigerate them up to 12 hours before baking before the proofing process arrange croissants by 6 on a baking tray to proof the croissants place them on a counter top set aside to proof for two and a half to three hours at room temperature until puffed up and spongy pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees and bake them for 10 minutes then turn down the heat to 375 degrees and bake them for another 12 to 15 minutes gorgeous I love it you've all been waiting for delicious buttery and flaky croissants sorry guys you", "Cnb1oPD_YBQ": "I'm out here today I've got the target downrange down here well I've got the Mojo choke tube on the Benelli and I figure while is out here be cool to do a little comparison video pretty much myself and I think my whole team uses the Winchester long beard XR well I went ahead and picked up the double X and I've got the winchester super X two kind of shooting down ranch just to compare those and I'm gonna show you guys the results of that at the end of this video [Music] [Music] I'm pretty much shot my shoulder off and this was the last one I did here this is the five shot long beard XR and I was just doing it from 30 yards I did everything from 30 yards you can see I was a little off there but that's open sights and everything holds a really really tight pattern and this holds a tight pattern I can vouch for it up to you know 60 yards even and that mojo choke there's a heck of a job combined with that well I try to lay him out where you can see them as best as you could a shot pretty much three-inch of everything except the XRS I already had them at three and a half inch and didn't want to buy them in three-inch but I had the devil X that is the six shot that did really well it's pretty impressed with that and then you had the Winchester Super X which of course just didn't hold the pattern even anywhere close to compared to the double X or the long beard XR and of course the long beard XR I shot the four shot and the five shot both hold a really close close pattern and if you like taking those longer shots or if you like to hit exactly where you aim that is the ammo for you now if you like to have a little bit wider shot then you might want to look at the devil X or even the Winchester Super X but all three have done great and I was pretty impressed by them [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "U1nJWSbDnU4": "[Music] hey and welcome to another x32 slash m32 quick tip here on the sava sound youtube channel my name is Don Odom and thanks for joining me today today we are going to be discussing the output tabs on the routing page on the x32 platform sound consoles so the first step will be to navigate to the routing page on the x32 if you were on the physical console all you need to do is click the routing button to the right of the excerpt to choose main display if you're on the x32 edits software the routing button is in the same location now we already discussed the first page here called home in a previous video and you can find that video link in the description so let's start by taking a look here at the first page out 1 through 16 now as you can imagine this assignment page is going to reflect the main 16 outputs in the x32 universe these outputs can be sent to local console i/o digital sync i/o and also card i/o we can see all the different types of outputs we can send down these channels here we can send the main buses mixed busses matrix mixes direct outs and also monitor outs we also have the option of changing where in the signal chain the output is being sent pre fader post fader Priya q post EQ and there's a few other options as well we can also enable a delay to time align speakers matrixes and things of that nature the next page we are going to be taking a look at is the aux out page alright on the X 32 and M 32 have an additional fixed quarter inch outputs separate from the main 16 outputs outputs 5 & 6 also have mirrored RCA left/right outputs here on the aux out page we have the option of changing these output assignments similar to that of these 16 outputs also on this page we have the option to change the aes/ebu left and right output which is located on the back of the console and we can do that by clicking here and changing the output you can see that right now we have the main left and right mixes assigned to that IES output all right a aes/ebu is a cool way of sending two channels down or two channels of audio down one line of AES three pin cabling similar to XOR however these are special rated cables that cost slightly more than XOR the reason for this is because they are specifically rated at a 110 ohm impedance so they can carry two channels of audio in the future we will be making a video about aes/ebu to get our viewers well-versed in digital AES and of course we have the output tap again as well now let's take a look at the p16 output page or the ultra net page we do that by clicking p6 see now as most of you know the x32 has been supporting personal mixing systems since as long as I can remember from its launch I believe and here we can change what we want being sent out the 16 alternate outputs for the P 16 personal mixing systems if you have a turbo sound IQ rig you can hit edit IQ setup here and change the model the IQ speaker the EQ and stuff like that it's a very cool thing you also groups of speakers and you can work along all these different lines of getting stuff patch in it's just a very neat thing to to play around with especially if you have those speakers all right and of course again we have the option if we go back to edit ultra net to change where in the signal chain or the tap as well alright now we have the famous card out page alright this is a very popular page to be using here on the x32 because a lot of people by the x32 fourths card functions all right so this menu will change based on which card you have installed if you're like me and you have the stock x USB card this is what it will look like it will also look like this if you're using a Madi card or stuff like that okay we have the option to change exactly what is being sent out the 32 channels we can send all the local inputs digital snake inputs and logout alternate ounce auxin and aux outs okay you can see all of those different selections here and then we have two identical pages for both AES 50a and AES 50b connections we can change what we add patch into the 32 digital outputs and also the last two blocks will change what we have patched into the digital stage box location alternate outputs the AES 50 B page has the same exact layout but it's obviously for the secondary AES 50 B port last but not least we have the XLR out page which will change the analog output connections to anything from anywhere in the x32 univer including outs 1 through 16 P 16-ounce card returns and stuff like that alright I hope I can answer all your questions about routing outputs if not please do not hesitate to leave a comment if you are looking

"dQBHVPJD_RU": "good morning we're ready for our math lesson which is less than 99 this is the lesson for Monday it is called reducing mix numbers I first like you to take out your green sheet to do your mental math if you would do so be sure that you do how many Ounces are in a pint and how many pints are in a quart how many Ounces are in a quart and then do ABCD and then pause the video and come back for the answers okay let's do the answers to mental math how many Ounces are in a pint there are 16 ounces in a pint there how many pints are in a quart there are two pints in a quart and how many Ounces are in a quart there is 32 a is 218 B is 349 and C reduces for twelve to one three six twelve to one half and eight twelve to two thirds and then of course D the answer is seven I hope you did well let's now look at our lesson together this really is an easy lesson you're going to enjoy of reducing these mixed numbers we reduce a mixed number by reducing its fraction the mixed number four and two fours is not in its simplest form because the fraction can be reduced when we reduce the fraction the whole number is not changed now let's look at the examples for and two-fourths means four plus two fourths so the two force reduces to 1/2 and so 2 or excuse me four and 2/4 in well equal 4 and 1/2 so you see that our mixed number for did not change but we reduce the fraction it still means the same they are equal now let's turn to the top a page 378 and we're gonna look at our first example okay here we go we are going to reduce 3 & 4 6 we reduce a mixed number by reducing its fraction so since the fraction 4 6 reduces to 2/3 I think you can see that if you divided 2 into that fraction you would get 2/3 the mixed number 3 & 4 6 reduces to 3 and 2/3 notice that the whole number did not change fraction answers which can be reduced should be be alert for fraction answers which can be reduced so let's look at example 2 on this we have 4 + 5 6 - 1 + 1 6 what is our solution we subtract 4 minus 1 is 3 so we get 3 5 6 - 1 6 gives us 4 6 so our answer is 3 + 4 6 but we notice that 4 6 can be reduced so let's look at that three and four six can reduce to 3 and 2/3 again if I had four six and undivided that down I could take 2 into both 4 & 6 which would give me 3 and 2/3 or simply reducing just like we did a couple chapters before well let's have practice now I would like you to try the practice session pause your video do the practice set and then come back and I'll do the answers now let's look at the answers a one and two eighths if I reduce to eighths I can take two into there and I'm going to get one-fourth so my answer cut becomes 1 and 1/4 B I have two and six ninths we see the common number is 3 so 3 goes into 6 two times and into 9 3 so we have 2 and 2/3 C is very easy two and five tenths we know five goes into both so we have two on one half now let's look at D 3 and 2/4 we've seen that before we know that 2 goes into 2 and goes into 4 so we have 3 and 1/2 e 3 & 4 sixth we know that 2 goes into there so we have 3 and 2/3 and F 4 and 3 12 we know 3 goes into 3 once and it goes into 12 4 times so we have 4 and 1/4 here we're going to add or subtract as indicated reducing answers so let's get ready for this G we have one on 1/4 plus 1 and 1/4 so 1 plus 1 is 2 & 2 4 equals 1/2 H 4 plus 2 is 6 110 plus three-tenths we know as 4/10 and that reduces to 2/5 and i 6-1 we know is 5 9 tenths and 1 tenths is 10 tens or it's a - excuse me 9 - 9/10 - 110 we know is 8/10 and that that will reduce to 4/5 I hope you got that one let's look at J 3 and 1/8 plus 5/8 we know that will be three and we know that will be 6/8 which can reduce to 3/4 NK 5 minus 1 is 4 5/8 and 1/8 so 5 minus 1 5/8 minus 1/8 gives us 4 eighths which is 1/2 NL 5 + 5 12 minus 1/12 well we know that equals 5 and 5 twelfths minus 1 is 4 12 and we know that that equals 1/3 now we're ready to do our regular assignment the problem set please do all 25 let's do number one together just to get you started Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776 he died exactly 50 years later what year did he die 1826 now if you will pause and do all of your problem set", "Kfx-I2ERQ20": "you getting more ammo in the back yeah I got another box in there oops how many you're in there yeah maybe make it even ten well a dish oh well right there there's one another in 15 no yeah we're done sperm inning good that's it you pour it back in the other container let's internist a little extra next batch I guess I'm just gonna save it all right so you got half pounds of tannerite at about how many yards are we going from 25 yards it with me shooting that with an 8k so let's see how many thousand rounds this takes to uh get done but hopefully we'll get a decent explosion out of this if I can hit it and not just hit the post and knock it over like an idiot you feel great about myself I'll just edit out all the misses you got it that time little mini muffin slammer still echoing it's at the top of animal oh no I have to check the David Chuck lifter up you can't Wow well that didn't look like that before did it and now we're done panda tannerite in a ak-47 get some I heard some debris hit back here just just a little bit why truck tore it up as he did well the rocks are a little scattered at this point and the one piece and another and the mace the main chunk is over here oh look you can get some moisture in there that we explained does not bad my first trophy of the season", "eHbc2sPZPpI": "there we go I just have to work in the dark so you guys can see okay here we go and this is rosin core solder so it doesn't need it's got its own flux built in and I really don't want to get the brass too hot because it will create marks or discoloration I really don't want that I had a piece yeah the day changed because of that and I couldn't get it clean and unfortunately it cracked so here we go we're starting to get some stuff flat you know get my spray bottle ready follow this right around you know you want to find out there you go everyone's flat all the way around this piece here picked right up so let go of these keeping my tweezers put this in my water so got a little spot there and a tiny little spot there so here's what I'm looking at see the little gap right there I don't want that so here's how I fixed that I got another little tiny gap back here probably what happened was the solder didn't spread to that so here's how I fix it I take a little chunk of solder that had left over and I flattened it pretty much paper-thin take some tweezers my tweezers are dead and I'm gonna slide it into that spot now I'll take my curved pliers here because this is a thin end I can just use these smaller snips are not sniffs but forceps I block out here and I have it kind of just angled so that the solder flows down and I'm just gonna heat that spot really quick just enough to get it to really tape it's just dropped and now I'm going to do the same thing with the other end so you need another piece of really thin wire so much I can slide in there and it just marked it probably lifting up come get in the hole well we're so close to being done thank you okay so this is gonna be the same thing I'm going to take my round I use the round one so that I can squish down that whole area without it lifting up I use the big ones and I'm clamping from the other side so that it makes it compress this whole area here because as you heat this up the rest is going to want to come up so we don't want that good thing you can do is put a little water on this end then it help draw out some of the heat so again right through our spot and I'm just watching forward to just liquify and drop the sole thing in our water so what we're left with is a flat-pack say you got these two little balls here what I'll do is I'll take my flush cutters and those guys will just wash cut off and we won't have to worry about them so much in the cleanup all right so we are down on all sides let's take and do just a little bit of dermal work here I'm gonna take my drum here and I'm going to go to the newest highest grit bit I think is 200 I think it is and I'm just barely gonna touch this to the edge to the edge here what I'm trying to do now is bevel down the edge of the brass to match the spoon this is about three here sorry I need like to work you know the little ball the spotters are so much easier whenever it's like that to just flush cut it then they get caught up in your standard alright get this off of here we're gonna take and go to I think 400 should work with our wheel here lengthen up divisor six and we're just gonna blend the spoon and the breath together we're just trying to create a nice smooth peace I don't like sharp edges nothing to snag up and this helps clean it up and make it blend together a lot better what we're left with is this we got some of the black from the Flex I might go ahead and get rid of that right now if with the buffer and [Music] and yes I can't hold my breath that long pretty consistently over two minutes all right let's go to the red just to see what we can get [Music] not too bad just a couple of little kinks in the back but hey it's handmade so we got our front we did get a little bit of discoloration there I'm not sure if I can get that out with q-tips or not maybe and be close so what I'm gonna do now is go through [Music] go over this one more time so we did get a couple I did get a little bit of solder in our little tiny holes like that one got a bunch of solder the rest of them are pretty clean and we got just this touch of solder down here in the bottom just touch the solder down here and then just a little tiny hole right up there got filled that's not too bad so although I need to do to finish this guy up is I need to put my homework I need to put the date so September I think it might be September well put the month and year on here and I still have to put a hole up here for the jump ring and we'll have a finished pendant I'll take and I'll put this in the tumbler after I put it in the ultrasonic so I can get all that little gunk and stuff out of there and we'll have our finished pendant so that only took I think two and a half hours but there are a lot of fun and I had fun making it so I hope you guys all have a great day remember to subscribe right here and there's another video right here that you can check out also whenever you go to our Channel you can go through all of our pages this video will be in a series because it's so long I'm gonna try and keep the videos down to 15 minutes now so there'll be part one and so on but thanks for joining me have fun you", "8zVfLHycskA": "hello everyone Jeremy here from flatware creations I just wanted to give you guys kind of what's on my bench for the next couple of days so I'm gonna start wrapping some stones I've been trying to get back to these for months now let's see if I can do this without the light off so have a nice piece of dichroic glass I'll be rapping with this pickle fork and then I have this it's gonna be unique spoon now we put in the forget what that one's called I'll remember here in a second and they may have just really nice it's hard I'm looking through the camera trying to do all of this nice and yellow with a little bit of blue in there and the spoon is a sugar spoon it's really fancy I'm actually gonna curl up the spoon so it wraps around it a little better and you'll be able to get those those colors out of it why are you wearing it not cooperating and then this one here's a fossil there we go the knife is from 1908 I think and then I forget what this fossil is called but it it fits just right so I'm gonna take the the bead hole out of it where's my finger and round it off and then I have another herkimer diamond' I'll be working on this Fork is absolutely amazing this is really really cool but I'm gonna wrap their diamond with these tongs tines it'll ramp up I'm gonna try and keep the flowers up here and then make this the mounting point for that my mounting my jump ring will go here you'll get the nice flowers and then you have the Herkimer wrapped I might actually take out this middle time so you really get to see the diamond and then this little guy has a lot of flash to them I'm using a small four pronged Fork it's really thin and then this beautiful teardrop labradorite just really amazing blue on it so I'll get that one figured out and then we have a semicolon event a mental-health event coming up in January so I'll be making a bunch of different semicolon items this week also some more pendants like this will turn some of them into keychains I have an idea for a bangle bracelet it has a spoon a spoon bracelet the entire spoon with this mi colon in it and then I might play around find something else to turn into semicolon oh I forgot about this guy so this guy's sterling silver and he's gave my favorite one boom look at that so those black lines I'm gonna take and run the fork times up those lines so what you're gonna get is that nice shiny blue right between everything so you don't really lose it let's go really pretty it's coming up like this a better angle so fits in fits right in with that it's that fork it's just amazing but that's some of the stuff on my bench for this week I'll try and get it all but as much of these done as possible and I'll try to get a few of them on video I know I'm gonna have a hard time with this one so I'll probably do that one on a video I'm definitely doing the Herkimer and this guy why do this guy just because I think it's gonna be a challenge to really get it to sit right and just really shine so we'll call it four of these we'll put up on YouTube and then if you decide to purchase one then you'll also be able to go to youtube and show how it was made and see how long it took and that kind of stuff you get a little bit more backstory behind it and all of these will be signed and dated month and year so it should be a lot of fun all right I'll help you guys all have a good day check out our flatware

"lBc2SXiEtd8": "hi thanks for checking out next-level carpentry you know it might be a surprise to some viewers that that not everything carpenters are required to do fall under the category of living the dream of being a carpenter shingling roofs insulating and caulking control joints in concrete all fall into that category but it's work that still needs to be done if you have a system that provides excellent results every time well it takes away some of the pain and misery out of doing an unpleasant job so today I just want to do a quick video and I always say quick and you know it happens but I want to do a quick video about the system I use or the steps I use for getting professional results in sealing up control joints and expansion joints in concrete every time and this is like a lot of projects having the right tools and the right technique are key to successful results the best sealant I've found for sealing these control joints is a urethane caulk but make a note it's not the self leveling kind that stuff has a time and a place and a purpose but for the most part it's difficult to work with and I don't see consistent results with it so I use a urethane caulk but it's it can be used vertical or horizontal it's not self leveling and I just tool it into place to get great results so this is the typical gun that's used for this sort of stuff I like this style it has a smooth plunger on here not a ratcheting little cheap stamped metal handle it's worth the extra money to buy a good gun and then I use a chunko demonic fast cure but sicka makes one and np1 makes a good urethane but I've always used the trimco demonic so that's to say a good gun and a good product are the first and most important things to have for this sort of work because of the volume of this sort of caulking I do I don't use this standard caulk gun but rather use this this bazooka style it's made by the same manufacturer it's got the same mechanism for advancing the plunger and this is called a sausage gun and the reason is that instead of rigid tubes with a fixed nozzle on every tube this gun takes these sausages and it's literally a sausage with a thin foil coating little crimped ends and they slip down into this tube I guess I'll show how that works now this is what a sausage looks like when it's spent I was doing some caulking yesterday it's all crisps mashed down to nothing but I just released the retract the plunger and drop in the sausage tube slides right down in that tube and then I advanced it so that little end sticks out and the best way to get rid of that little crimped end is a pair of regular side cutters hope this focuses just clips that off and I'll mention it now and I'll mention a few times in the video this Yorick urethane it's like ooh black man once it gets on something it gets on everything so managing where the wet urethane is you've got to pay attention to it so they don't make a mess out everything but these sausage guns come with these plastic tips they come like this it's just a solid tip and then it can be snipped off to whatever size joint you're working on I've got a whole range here and believe it or not there's times when I've used this monster tip to lay down a ridiculous B to the sealant and that's not an ideal application but kind of a Hail Mary to stabilize a situation but for the most part I'll cut about this size that's Oh about a 5/8 half-inch 5/8 inch hole works really well and that's what I'm going to be using today so this little foil part twists out of here this is where I manage that wet it's just sticky when those strands get stuck on stuff they just don't go away slip the tip down in this retainer ring just put that over the end of the foil tighten it down and then the advancing plunger just pushes the urethane out of that foil tube and on out this tip it's a great setup there's not a lot else that's necessary for this kneepads aren't essential but they sure help preserve the pants and the knees I've got those old beat-up that old beat-up hair then masking tape you'll see how that gets used I use it in different widths but I always get a good quality tape this 3m stuff is good and holds up for this process 409 is essential for doing this job and you'll see how that works and last but not least is fine silica sand that's the key to getting excellent results every time and having them stay excellent this is a superfine grade it's really nice you can use stuff that's a little more course but silica sand is nice it's better than place and because it has a kit consistent texture and appearance place and tends to have pebbles and rocks in it depending on the job I'll put the silica sand at different dispensers this is just like an old ketchup thing that allows me to sprinkle it I keep an old paintbrush around for brushing the sand around if necessary and then on bigger longer joints where I've accessed I'll use this bigger container for the same purpose but just applies the sand more quickly so that's the overview and background the arsenal of things needed to do a good job on this so I'm gonna head outside and show you how the process works well let's go I did a little pre cleaning on these control joints with a thin diamond wheel and the side grinder to clean up rough spots and make a uniform gap between the driveway slab and the garage slab after cleaning up the control joint with the diamond wheel the next step is to blow up the joint when these loose dust pebbles rocks leaves bugs and whatever from the joint I use a leaf blower here but this compressed air is available it's better well not only is it this the most enjoyable work but it's starting to get cool and breezy but I'm going to keep going just to show that this could be done in somewhat less than ideal conditions as long as it's not wet here the masking tape will stick and I could proceed it's a little on the cool side but I've never had any issues other than a slower curing time by applying this yesterday I was doing a bunch and it was 37 degrees everything's fine anyway so the first step after this is ground smooth to my satisfaction and all the dust is blown out and it's dry I apply the masking tape and I hope should this shows in the video these two surfaces are somewhat unlevel and that's fine that helps water drain off and not pool here but I want to show how I treat an area like this and then down at the other end of the door these levels are more even but I'm using the same method to deal with it and I want the joint to start somewhat slightly down it'll be a concave joint in there so I'll apply the masking tape just slightly below the crown of these tools edges as you'll see the edges of the masking tape determine the edges of the Sinister I'm using finger pressure to seal down the edge of that tape that's important this is hard to do with the camera rolling this upper side and I like that that'll make the joint wide enough to have enough volume to stretch but not so wide that it's smeared up here on the finished driveway surface and this handheld panning shot you can see a little more closely what's going on here finished joint wolf be slightly concave about like the tip of my thumb here and the edges will be feathered out down nice and smooth so they don't catch and peel out and I'll speed up this video a little bit because it's boring but I hope you get the idea that running this masking tape is surprisingly quick and efficient at cross or T intersections I use a special technique with the tape to get nice crisp corners I tear the tape so it's got a kind of an angle on there and I can start that angle right down in the joint like that I've already done this other direction but I tear the piece of tape with an angle going the other way and match up the corners of the tape so when I peel this tape back they'll be a nice start corner I can do this side to here and this will be a little better example just tear the tape so it has a one end edge longer than the other stick it down and put that sharp end to tape right where I want the corner to be and I use the opposite angle on the other side line up the two corners some basically mitering masking tape if you can believe that with the masking tape down that's the end of the prep work it's time to apply the urethane caulk out of this gun I work right to left generally just that's just the way I am I'm right-handed and I do as much of a section as I can with whether allowing the stuff is super sticky if wind is blowing dirt and leaves around it'll stick to that caulk immediately so I'll do a short section if it's a beautiful day nice and calm I can do a longer section but the main thing is I try to apply the caulk so that the joint is full and has that little concave surface to it that's really close to the finished joint I want I don't want to starve it for caulk and I don't want too much because then it's harder to tool it and I guess the main thing I'm thinking about when I'm applying the caulk is to let the caulk work its way down into that joint so I I let the bead of caulk build a head of the tip as it goes so that I know it's getting down into that crack and there's all sorts of crack types with backer rod and all sorts of things that need to be taken care of but those are kind of another subject I just want to show how to get a nice perfectly tooled finished joint and not cover the extremes of what's possible with this system and I'll just do a short section here going through all the steps so you can see how it works beginning with filling the joint with caulk got a roll of paper towels handy here which I did not mention in the supplies but they're absolutely essential for this I'm gonna push out the little skinned over end of caulk from work I was doing yesterday and then I started on the joint you can see the  come out of the tube and get ahead of the tip and I just pushed that along so you can see how it folds or rolls down into that joint as it goes I'm using the rounded surface of this tip that's cut on an angle to form that concave surface on the bead it's just a little more than is necessary but as I told it it works a little more down into that joint and this part of the process you kind of get the hang of as you do a little bit so that you don't have extra fussing to do when tooling the joint the closer this is to the finish bead the less trouble it is later on but that's looking pretty good right there if you ask me this is where the magic comes in because although that's not a bad looking joint it's not what I want to end up with instructions say apply to a clean dry frost free surface tool to desired finish dry tooling recommended do not thin if there is anything controversial about this video and this method it's going to be that dry tooling recommended I use the 409 which is a mild soapy liquid for wet tooling and you'll see how and why I've had people comment that using that will put bubbles in them surface I've done thousands of feet of this and never had a single bubble to worry about other trimco urethane products say right on the container that a mild soapy solution is useful for tooling the product and I've never experienced any negative results of the cured product using this method if you've had conflicting experience and don't like this idea well just don't use it and if I try to tool this dried tool or whatever in some cases where the edges are perfectly smooth I'd get a good finish speed but a fingertip is about the only way to be able to get a finished nice finish being in all situations but as soon as you touch this stuff it's just sticky as all get-out you can't get a good bead in here that's reliable or consistent so that's where the magic of 409 or a soapy spray comes in just a quick spritz of that bead and a fingertip and this stuff just tools out like magic and the goal of this tooling is to feather that caulk down to where it's just the thickness of the masking tape where it meets the masking tape I don't want to step there another cool thing about this is if I need to add more caulk which I don't really need to here but I want to show you I can just go right over that 409 with another spritz and just work that additional caulk in like I said in this in this situation I didn't need to do that but if you end up with a spot that's a little starved for urethane you can add some more and conversely if you get too much you can just scoop this stuff out and put it in somewhere else and just work back and forth and tell that joint is nice and full with a little concave surface and that's just as smooth as can be once I'm happy with the way that joint is filled and tooled I pull off the masking tape and make a note I pull the masking tape across the bead so that this little if there's any extra sealant there it folds it over onto that tool joint so you get this little flash edge on there but again it's no big deal because a little spritz of 409 allows that little bit to fold over into the bead and come up with a perfect edge no slop no smear onto the concrete I pull this other piece of tape across the joint this way for the same reason and the better of a job you do tooling the joint the less of this extra flare that you get and again practice makes that go a little more smoothly and that right there is what I'm looking for there's no uneven this there's no dip there's no bumps there's no smears it's perfect a little bit of 409 on the surface that doesn't hurt anything and now I can sprinkle in some of that fine silica sand into the joint just trying to overdo it it doesn't matter the only part of that sand that remains is what actually sticks to the caulk the rest of this will just blow away when it dries and that caulk does are that sand does two things it keeps dirt and bugs out of there it keeps it from sticking to a shoe if somebody happens to step on this before it's cured and it also gives the surface of the caulk a rough texture a little bit like smoothly finished concrete I can use this soft dry brush to take off some of that excess sand so you can see what it looks like underneath there keep in mind that that caulk is incredibly soft right now and even pushing too hard with a brush can change the surface of the clock I'm gonna go ahead and caulk and sand the rest of these joints here today and probably by the time I get done editing the video that sand will be dry enough to blow it away but I hope you agree that that's a pretty sweet looking sealed control joint I'm just going to let the camera run while I tool and say the rest of this joint to give you an idea of the speed of this process once you get a system down and kind of get used to the steps the sausage tube contains the same volume as two of the standard size caulking tube but there's far less waste by-product [Music] well it should give you a pretty good idea how this process works of course I don't have a cameraman here I'm trying to line up for the camera so that kind of slows me down and then I'm doing extra starting and stopping for the video when I'm just doing a section like this I can just do this whole length put the in to lit peel up the tape put in the sand like that so it looks a lot slower than it is when you get up to speed on it a section like this probably take 20 minutes less than a half an hour to do it and get a really nice job I took pictures a few years back of how not to do a control joint and I can stick those in here in the video you can see that it's all uneven it's sloppy it's not smooth it fills up with dirt and bottom line is it doesn't seal up the joint very well the advantage of using this method with this product instead of a self-leveling is this driveway has a slope if I tried to do this joint here with self leveling it I'll just run down to that end and I'd have a mess on my hands using the masking tape can finds the edges it's very easy to get an uneven bead and if you don't have masking tape there anytime you touch it it just makes it worse so I really like this whole setup and I hope you find it helpful too the cold weather is making my camera battery fade there so I'm just gonna wrap this up well in the time it took the battery to recharge so I could shoot this this all dried up I got the sand blown off and so the bead is pretty much complete and for the record in the time the battery was charging I was able to do this control joint here this is a 10 foot door I was able to mask it it tool it and sand it all in that 10 minute period of time so it goes pretty quick once you're set up and you're not trying to do it in front of a camera so that's it for this video if you like what you saw I'd appreciate you consider subscribing if you haven't already and while you're at it poke that thumbs up button let YouTube know you like what you see going on here I've got some cold wet weather moving in so I'm glad to have this project taken care of I'm gonna go get this video edited and uploaded so you can check it out and as always until next time thanks for watching [Music]", "cUh-c4H3gg8": "-Cheesecake is a classic dessert. While it's delicious plain, cheesecake is\na culinary bland canvass that can be easily dressed up with a variety of stir-ins and\ntoppers. This unique recipe has a crunchy nut crust\nand a traditional cream cheese filling. Your family is sure to love it. First, let's preheat the oven to 350 degrees,\nthen make the crust. Pour 1 and three-quarter cups of crushed graham\ncrackers into a medium bowl. You can buy them like this or make your own\nin a food processor. Crushed cookies also make delicious crusts. You can substitute crushed ginger snaps, vanilla\nwafers, or chocolate sandwich cookies. Next, add a quarter cup of finely chopped\nalmonds to the bowel. You can also use finely chopped pecans, walnuts,\nor macadamia nuts instead. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. And if you like, go ahead and add half a teaspoon\nof ground cinnamon. Other spices that would make a tasty crust\nvariation are all spice, ginger, apple pie spice, or pumpkin pie spice. Stir the crust ingredients then pour in half\na cup of melted butter and mix well. If you're making a cookie crust variation,\nyou may need less melted butter, so add it gradually. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and\nabout 1-1/2 inches up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan Because we're going to bake\nthe cheesecake in a waterbath, let's place the springform pan on a double layer of large\nheavy duty aluminum foil. Bring the edges of the foil up and mold it\naround the sides of the pan to form a watertight seal. The waterbath baking method is recommended\nsince it yields a creamier texture without the top cracking. Now, let's make the filling. Crack 3 eggs into a small bowl. Beat them lightly and set them aside. Add two 8-ounce packages of softened cream\ncheese to a large mixing bowl and add one 8-ounce container of sour cream. Add 1 cup of granulated sugar. Now, add 2 tablespoons of flour and 1 teaspoon\nof vanilla extract. Use an electric mixer to beat the filling\nand to look smooth. Keep scraping down the sides of the bowl and\nthen mix again until it's fully blended  then add the eggs. Gently stir the eggs into the beaten cream\ncheese to prevent aerating the eggs and batter. This prevents the cheesecake from puffing\nup in the oven and falling in the center upon cooling. While we'll make a classic cheesecake here,\nat this point, you can gently stir in an added ingredient to make a specialty cheesecake. Try a cup of chocolate pieces or a cup of\nfresh berries. Pour the filling into the prepared springform\npan. Now, it's time to bake. Place the springform pan into a shallow roasting\npan and place the pan into the oven. Then pour enough hot water into the roasting\npan to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake it for 1 hour. You'll know the cheesecake is done when the\ncheesecake edges jiggles slightly then turn the oven off and allow the cheesecake to sit\nin the oven for 1 hour to allow it to set then remove the springform pan from the waterbath. Place it on a wire rack. Allow it to cool for 15 minutes. Use a small knife to loosen the crust from\nthe sides of the pan and cool the cheesecake for another 30 minutes. Remove the sides and allow the cheesecake\nto cool completely on the rack. Cover the cheesecake and chill it for at least\n4 hours before serving. Cheesecakes and dessert sauces are a match\nmade in heaven. So, it's worth planning to make a sauce too. There's a delicious recipe for homemade fudge\nsauce at bhg.com. Yum!", "0ERh-nj5jjw": "Hey everybody, it's Charlotte. Today on\nMaker's Moments, we will be teaching you how to find out how much candle wax you need. Calculating the amount of wax that you will need depends on how many candles you are planning to make, as well as the total ounce fill for each container. First, you'll want to find out the total ounce fill for the vessel or container you plan to use. Many candle container companies will give you the ounce fill. For example, you can find the ounce fill for all the vessels from The Wooden Wick Co. under the description on each product page. Next, you will want to subtract an\nounce from that container's fill to account for your candles fill line. For\nsafety purposes you never want to fill a candle container to its full capacity.\nAlways allow for a minimum of approximately a quarter inch around the\ndiameter of your candle to be free of wax. To do this, you can subtract one ounce of wax from your container fill. For example, if my container fill is 8 ounces, I'd only be using 7 ounces of wax to fill the container. Next, you'll want to add up the total amount of your ounce fill by the amount of candles that you would like to make. Here, I'm making six candles, so I would want to multiply 7 ounces by 6 candles - I'll need a total of 42 ounces of wax. Most waxes out there will be sold in pounds. You will want to calculate the ounce conversion for your chosen wax. For example, virgin coconut soy from The Woden Wick Co. is sold in five pound slabs. This is equal to roughly 80 ounces of\nliquid wax, so I would need only one slab of wax and have some leftover for the\nspecific candle project. Ready to put your newfound knowledge into practice? How do you calculate the amount of wax you will need? Let us know in the\ncomments below. Don't forget to subscribe to our channel to stay in the know on all the latest maker's tips and tricks. See you next time on Maker's Moments.\nHappy making!", "oX4YTPxNXp0": "hello everyone this is Jeremy from flatware creations I haven't done what's in my tumbler for a while because I haven't been running it a whole lot but this is half of an order for bud basis so I got the the spoons in the tumbler now and all these guys will sit up like this on top of the spoon so I think there's fifty something here and then as I was cutting them I was also making some birdhouse bodies some bells and then these will probably end up being like toothpick holders or something and then there was a random ring that was in there so these balls to come out pretty cool but I'm excited I hope everyone has a great day and make sure you subscribe", "mBZKAjMa454": "hi it's Jan Dee Audrey its desert day in a one-minute kitchen chocolate fluff is the right stuff for a fabulous dessert here's what you'll need a 14 ounce package of Oreos some milk and whipping cream sugar salt and eggs 1 packet of gelatin and some vanilla add the gelatin and a cup of milk to a bowl stir and set aside separate 2 eggs you'll just need the yolks then crush the Oreos into fine crumbs and you can do that by putting them in a plastic bag and pounding them with a rolling pin or you can use a mini prep or food processor then separate into two bowls add 2 tablespoons of melted butter to one bowl and mix that's the bottom layer you can use any cake pan like a deep-dish tart pan for easy lift out or you could make individual servings add the butter and crumb mixture to the pan and press down firmly for the filling prepare a double boiler at the milk and gelatin sugar egg yolks salt and vanilla whisk to combine and cook for about 8 minutes or until slightly thickened while it's cooling whip the heavy cream and then pour the cooled filling into the whipped cream blending until smooth now pour the mixture over the cookie base and sprinkle with the rest of the crumbs refrigerate overnight and then slice and enjoy chocolate fluff is just good stuff I've fun in the kitchen one minute at a time one minute kitchen proudly presented by these sponsors [Music]", "NAiXRQWj_T0": "hey guys welcome back to the channel today we're gonna give you a glimpse inside how to make another fence I know we've got one on this channel before however this one so simple three stockade panels pre-made one has been cut in half to make those two gates let's see how we did it oh and by the way I've got new t-shirts guys you can always get me original Matt a glimpse inside org but we've got new ones right here Keep Calm and make on it's a little email signature I give out through all my emails if you and I have been in contact you'll note I'm talking about those shirts are available in limited supply check the link below and let's get this project underway hey guys welcome back my name is Chris and today on a glimpse inside we are gonna make a new fence and gate right behind me there's something that has to get torn down now I know I have a fencing gate on this channel before but that was a very big project a very daunting gate a lot of people say oh I wish I had the time the patient is the skill to do something like that this is going to be made from three fence panels one of those is gonna be ripped right down the middle and we're gonna make a gate out of that by reinforcing the back so much simpler so much easier we're gonna give you a glimpse on how we do this today so guys join us today and also no flip-flops shoes today hopefully you guys like that let's go all right let's get this underway after a quick trip to the big box store I picked up four two by fours to landscape timbers three stockade panels and a few extra pickets and also four four by fours to replace the fence posts though there's a few ways you can go about disassembling an old fence you can use a drill or a screw gun to unscrew all the screws or you can use in this case I use the mini sledge and that seemed to work just fine as well with the fence post out of the way now it's time to remove these four by fours and I looking for me the previous homeowner didn't use any cement so you just wiggle these back and forth a little bit and they come right out well until the last one I tried I broke it off turns out it handsome too in it 20 minutes later got it out now I want to dig four new holes to install these posts what I'm doing is I'm taking my weed eater here and I'm kind of tilling up the ground I'm gonna rake it flush to give me a good starting off point I take a measurement of the span and it's 23 feet two inches that's perfect as you see me here I'm using an 8 foot 2x4 to kind of give me a reference somewhere it did my post but the 23 feet is great because it affords me 2 by 3 pre-made stockade panels and I'm actually able to rip one in half or a little bit less than half to go ahead and make those two doors as I'm thinking these post holes I'm taking very careful measurements here that each one is 30 inches in depth now I'll explain why here just in a second so check this out [Music] alright guys so in my previous video somebody called me a because I didn't put any foam or concrete in these posts so we're gonna try this okay I've never done it before here's hoping it works and maybe this time I won't be a  so this mixture comes in a two-part bag you simply roll up one side it breaks the seal in the middle you then squeeze both sections together for 15 seconds you can start to feel the bag become very hot actually as this happens so half the contents go in one closed half the contents going the other and within about one minute I'm gonna bring in here you can see this foam starts to rise up so while this stuff is sitting I got three minutes you can make small micro just lather rinse repeat we're gonna break the seal in the middle we're gonna blend the two parts together and this stuff does get hot they say you can't leave it uncut or the bag might explode maybe that should be another YouTube video I don't know anyway I'm gonna go and let the foam come halfway up on this one and then set the plumb making sure they're all level after about thirty minutes I'll go ahead and trim off the excess I'm just using a serrated paring knife here and I'm gonna go ahead and trim it down to the level in which the ground is gonna be nothing too fancy here just cover it up with some dirt when you're all finished just like I did there now it's time to fill in the post holes that were originally there clean up a little bit make it a little bit more tidy before we install the fence panels alright time to install the first panel this is a very simple process I'm gonna go ahead and install these three inch screws right through to the fence post this isn't going to be the final method of installation I'm actually going to use the five inch lag bolts once one side is installed I'll make some micro adjustments to level it up run around to the other side and install those screws as well here are the five inch lag bolts I was speaking of and I'm going to do three per post [Music] I repeat the same process on the other side installing the fence panel as well just the same way of course I tried to do a one-day build and it starts to rain well you got to love this fickle floral weather not a big deal though we're gonna get back to it just in a second gonna grab some lunch and we'll get back to building all right the rains cleared up and now I'm gonna go ahead and rip the stockade panel not quite in half I'm cutting these pieces to give me the exact measurements I need for the space that I have again it's about seven feet or so so I'm basically not gonna use one foot of the stockade panel to make these gates now at this point I'm gonna bring my miter saw out here you can do this whole project with a speed square a circuit of assault of a drill however it's been raining on and off all day and I'm trying to get this done just a little bit faster so I'm using the help of this miter saw to cut these landscape timbers and a few two by fours in the future now these landscape timbers are cut to the length of the span between the two fence panels I'm gonna go ahead and dig a trench to set them in kind of making a makeshift threshold as you will I'm gonna need these landscape timbers to actually be a part of the locking mechanism that's gonna be in one of the gates you can see I installed it leveled it pack some dirt in there and now we're good to go so add some ducks fly overhead I'm gonna take some measurements to make the essentially the Boxton frame for the gate these two by fours are all cut to length I'm gonna clamp them down install them of inch and 1/4 screws but the gate isn't quite finished there we need a little bit more strength than it were a little more lateral strength if you will so I'm gonna take another 2x4 and I'm gonna lay it diagonally across the panel make a few marks and then take my circular saw set it to the depth of the two back three right here and make a few cuts and then knock this piece out with a hammer just like that pull the nails out with some channel locks and now we're good to go now go ahead and make these cuts right here on the miter saw as well and now it's time to install it all right with the piece cut the link now it's time to install this diagonal support I'm gonna go ahead and toenail or toe screw this piece in I'm not sure what you call this technique but I'm doing it anyway I'm gonna flip it over install a straightedge and put two screws per picket all the way across the diagonal piece and I'm gonna do the same process on the other gate this gives the piece much needed strength and it worked out pretty well alright now to install the hardware here's what I'm doing I'm taking some scrap pieces of I'm installing them in to tipperary into this landscape timber I rest the gate on those pieces one they raise the gate up to give me the clearance I need to it's kind of like a second hand for me to install these hinges well I guess I didn't film that last part but as you can see here I had to add a little piece of 2x4 to accommodate the screw for the hinge and then I repeat the same process on the other side sometimes when you're working by yourself you've got to think outside the box and use techniques that work for you this is how I simply did it maybe you can find a better way I don't know I like how it work though this left gate is gonna be the one that's gonna be locked in place into the landscape timber so I put a backer board on the back of that gate now I'm using some blue tape to help me install the hardware that's gonna lock this gate together once the lock is installed I don't like the look of the bottom so I'm going to clean it up by cutting some of these pickets to the length of each of the gates and install them with some screws on the very bottom I simply use a squeeze clamp on one end level it with the other repeat the same process on the other side gives it a nice clean look alright guys let's talk about a couple things one being the fact that this fence panel and this fence panel are not the same height and that's because the ground itself is graded down away from the house and honestly I could have written the ground back up I could have graded it back up but I don't have much time to do these projects I got a wife three children full-time job I do this on the side and this is about what I can do in one day and I think it turned out pretty great so I'm gonna leave it at that but there is one more step we're gonna do I'm not gonna do it today it's about to rain again I wanted to get all this done in one day but I got one more afternoon and you're gonna see what I do right now well I try to give this in one day I couldn't quite manage due to the rain do they have in watch the kids for a little bit but I'm gonna spend about 30 minutes here getting the rest of it finished I got to put a locking mechanism down on this gate and then we'll tie the whole thing together so let's do that now first step in installing this locking mechanism is to mark where I need to drill the hole here's the hardware I'm using from the home Center as you can see it's a series of pipes kind of put together I did this on my last fence project and I liked it so much that I figured why not repeat it here so here's the hole we need we're gonna take a one and a quarter inch Forstner bit we're gonna hammer in this actual this I guess we call it collar if you will sometimes we sure I just found it in the plumbing supply area and we're gonna build this section up we're gonna take this elbow we're gonna screw it into this long two foot by three-quarter inch pipe and then it screw in a handle just like this now it's time to install the bracket but first I realize the backer board is it quite thick enough so I make an adjustment and I attach another piece of picked it to the backer with some 3/4 inch screws now here's a look at the C bracket I'm using you can find these in the electrical section of your home Center I'm using some inch and 1/4 panhead screws and actual nuts as washers as spacers if you will to give me some more room to have this thing move up and down free and clear so to keep this locking mechanism from falling down while we're opening the gate I'm gonna screw one more of these violets right Susan leaving about an inch out so that has someone arrests as you can see works pretty well quick design choice I didn't like those old pickets being on the bottom I wanted something a little bit more substantial so I took some 1 by 4 material and attached it along the bottom of the Gators well now it's time to install the handle and then one of these interlocking mechanisms on the other side for a little added security you know so I did say in the beginning that I bought some extra tickets and the reason I did that was you never know when you're gonna need them in this case since I moved the fence back about 3 feet it exposed some of the older fence which is not the most attractive so I'm using that to kind of cover it up to give the appearance of the new fence all the way around and here it is not too bad for this budget-friendly one-day build I'm really happy with how it turned out hey guys thanks for joining us for this project all the way to the end we definitely appreciate your viewership I want to tell you a little bit about this though this project was done not a single moment we spent in the shop I was out here the entire time with a circular saw a miter saw and some drills and we got this thing done in a day maybe a day and a half so I just wanted to put this on the channel I know it seems like a repeat but a completely different build yet very much the same I hope you got some knowledge from this I hope you got some education from this and hopefully it inspires you to get out there and do some weekend projects on your own guys thanks again for watching we definitely invite you to subscribe over here I got a few more videos over here you can watch and also don't forget new shirts down below Keep

here with another kitchen conundrum for you now today we're going back to the basics with measuring you need to learn how to measure correctly to have success when you are making recipes so today i'm going to show you how to do that starting off two different types of measuring cups we have a wet measuring cup and we have a dry measuring cup here now when you're using a dry measuring cup this is for things like flour and sugar and brown sugar you can also measure things like mayonnaise and sour cream in a dry measure anything that you can actually level off that is what you're going to use this for now for something that you would use a wet measure for would be anything that will level itself off so that you can see it with those lines so liquids they would go into this measuring cup here I'm going to start with dry measuring now flour main ingredient in baking here what you need to know is that you shouldn't dip your cup right into the canister itself because what that does is it packs flour into the cup so take a scoop or spoon and gently mix the flour lightening it incorporating a little bit of air because as this canister of flour sits on your shelf it actually compacts itself it settles on itself so give it a little bit of a fluff here and scoop it into your cup sprinkling it in using that offset spatula anything with a straight side you want to give the cup a little bit of a tap settling in any air pockets that might be in this cup of flour and a good swipe leveling it off and that is a perfect 1/2 cup of flour now if a recipe calls for sifted flour what that means is that you need to sift the flour first and then measure from this bowl measure this mixture here what that means is you're getting a lighter cup of flour something that isn't so heavy now something like sugar sugar is already dense so there's no need to stir it up and you don't need to scoop into the cup you can simply dip your cup into the canister itself and give it a good swipe and the weights would be completely consistent here this is a perfect 1/2 cup sugar now brown sugar we get a lot of questions here in the test kitchens how do I keep my sugar from getting too hard keep it in a well sealed container one of these airtight containers is really great take a piece of bread some people like to use a piece of apple and store it in with your brown sugar and it will help to keep the sugar nice and soft take your measuring cup dip it into the brown sugar and pack the sugar into the cup most recipes call for packed brown sugar now you know you've done this right if you tap it out into a bowl and the sugar holds its shape if it crumbles that means that you haven't packed it firmly enough and that you should start over so now for liquid measurements use a spouted glass measuring cup here and when you're measuring things like honey or molasses anything that's sticky and viscous sometimes corn syrup give your glass a spray with some nonstick cooking spray and what that does is it will easily slide out on you so I'm using honey today a half cup measure you want to check your measurement and you actually should bend down and check that it registers a half a cup so that it's nice and level and a half cup so this is good to go and that's how you measure a liquid ingredient so now to measure by weight what you need is a digital scale for this and certain recipes will call for ingredients by weight chocolate for example or fruit whenever you're baking so take the bowl that you're going to measure in to place it on the scale and you need to zero out or tear out the weight of the bowl itself so that you don't count that in the measurement so all you have to do is press the button again it should register zero and now you're ready to measure the weight of whatever ingredient you have so there you have it a few simple tricks and tips and measuring ingredients the right way and that will set you up for success in the kitchen if you have any kitchen conundrums write in the comments section below or reach out to us using the hashtag kitchen conundrum and we will solve whatever problems you may have you", "VtZTaj7e6_g": "okay there I'm Tyler and welcome back to the channel got a really quick one for you today DIY project only costs a couple bucks and makes a gigantic difference in a room and that is whitewashing brick or a brick fireplace like you see behind me right here whitewashing brick is a very simple process and only takes a couple of tools and items that you can see right here a brush to clean your brick off some paint obviously mixing cup stick a couple of chip brushes or a paintbrush that you're not too attached to some rags to clean things off when you're done to wipe down the brick and a couple of painter items to masks things down is a good idea okay onto mixing our paint this is my finishing card I got all of my stir sticks my measuring cups the spray stuff that I typically use right here but today we're just going to be using the surface to mix up the paint the paint we're going to be using is a product by Bayer it is an ultra white high-gloss this is what we have done all of the trim in the house with up to this point and since we're going to be knocking it down with water 50% water the gloss is going to be knocked down big time especially when we put it on this brick I got one of these mixing cups right here which allows to measure out 50/50 really well this is a 28 ounce cup and I'm gonna mix up 20 ounces of this paint so we'll do 10 ounces of water in 10 ounces of paint go ahead and add your water I am going to be using some bottled water here because we know it's nice and clean and there's gonna be no chunkies in it or anything like that so we got 10 ounces of water let's go ahead and add that 10 ounces of paint if you don't have one of these Sherline pour spout thingamajigs get one they're really awesome a little bit of a pain to clean out when you're done but it sure saves a gigantic mess when you're first setting things up here so again we're going for 20 ounces and it looks like we're right about there you do want to make sure you mix this early so all the particulates of the paint are suspended in the water before we start playing any of our water down paint take your little broom and make sure you sweep everything down getting off all the dirt dust cobwebs any loose mortar that might be on there very careful with this stuff it's like a bad dream waiting to happen if you drop it you do want to make sure as you work through your project you stir it every once in a while to make sure all those particulates remain suspended you can see what I got whitewashed over here and it's looking good so what you want to do is go ahead and take a dabble on your brush be careful this stuff runs everywhere so you don't want to grab a huge soak and wet brush bowl and then just dab it up into the tight areas and brush it into the brick you want to pay attention to the mortar because it is deeper than the brick and some bricks are a little more porous than others and will suck up a little bit more material and just got to pay attention to that and kind of think of this as a little bit like stain if you let it sit on there it's going to soak more of it in and be a little bit whiter or whatever color you're going to be painting your brick so just be conscious of how far ahead of yourself you were so that you don't have different zones of color so I like to do maybe four to six bricks and then grab my rag and wipe everything off and you will drip down just make sure you go catch those especially at the bottom like in our case we have a heart here that we're going to be staining just so again you don't have bad zones down there so once you've got a own paint it up go ahead and grab your rag and we're just going to kind of rub over the top of it making sure to get into that mortar and drawing everything out you can dab as well that will give you a little bit different look if that's what you're [Music] well that is a wrap I hope this video helps some of you out as so many paths YouTube videos have helped me out very simple

apartment\u00a0\nyou can't hang your tv on your wall that's why\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna transform these materials\u00a0\ninto this and i'll show you how i did it wow welcome to my channel i'm george\u00a0\njohnson jack of all trades\u00a0\u00a0 master of none and as you'll see i'm truly\u00a0\nnot a master carpenter but you don't have\u00a0\u00a0 to be a master carpenter to make an awesome tv\u00a0\nstand like this subscribe for more awesomeness\u00a0\u00a0 and if you want to help others find this\u00a0\nvideo be sure and give it a thumbs up\u00a0\u00a0 in this video i'll go from the concept to\u00a0\nthis complete stand using cheap wood and\u00a0\u00a0 some basic power tools that i think we all have\u00a0\naccess to so first thing is to form a concept\u00a0\u00a0 take stock of what you have and think about what\u00a0\nyou need i had this tv and a bracket so i decided\u00a0\u00a0 to build a mini standalone wall to mount it on i\u00a0\ndesigned it taking into account the woodworking\u00a0\u00a0 tools i have but the most important thing that\u00a0\nyou have is your skills this tv stand can be\u00a0\u00a0 built with some pretty simple steps simple cuts\u00a0\ndrilling screwing and gluing so drawing the plan\u00a0\u00a0 is actually the second step but the plan is going\u00a0\nto evolve as the concept evolves this sketch is\u00a0\u00a0 drawn to scale to make sure proportions look good\u00a0\non paper this is pretty close to what i ended up\u00a0\u00a0 building it shows the framing studs that i used\u00a0\nand the birch ply that i used and the dimensions i\u00a0\u00a0 used on the uprights came from the width of the\u00a0\nbirch ply and the width of the tv bracket not\u00a0\u00a0 shown on my plan is the location of the upright\u00a0\nbraces or the cross pieces inside the frame\u00a0\u00a0 so when you look at the height of this upright\u00a0\nyou only need to make it tall enough that your tv\u00a0\u00a0 bracket will mount as high as you want i made mine\u00a0\ntaller so i would have a place to put the shelf\u00a0\u00a0 so that most of the wi-fi router would be hidden\u00a0\nbelow the top of the tv and just the antenna would\u00a0\u00a0 stick up so that i get a signal throughout this\u00a0\napartment i actually have a pretty good signal\u00a0\u00a0 everywhere in the apartment all the materials\u00a0\nneeded are shown in my intro shot and listed in\u00a0\u00a0 the description if you buy from amazon you can use\u00a0\nmy links in the description to support the channel use your plans to estimate how much wood to\u00a0\nbuy i highly suggest you buy the leveling feet okay now start the next step\u00a0\u00a0 especially with cheap wood but regardless it's\u00a0\ngoing to be practically impossible to get all\u00a0\u00a0 these legs level and you're going to end up with\u00a0\na rocking horse instead of a tv stand in step 4 i\u00a0\u00a0 include measure and cut use your plans and make\u00a0\na cut sheet a list of all the pieces you need\u00a0\u00a0 and cut as many of them at once as you can my\u00a0\nplan didn't show the details of the cross pieces\u00a0\u00a0 but fair warning don't make the mistake i made i\u00a0\ncut all four to be inset which ended up causing\u00a0\u00a0 my frame to be twisted the right way would be to\u00a0\nbuild it with a top and bottom plate going to the\u00a0\u00a0 edges of the uprights if you're not sure what that\u00a0\nmeans check the link in the description step 5\u00a0\u00a0 is shape and smooth you decide what kind of\u00a0\nradiuses and angles and where you want to put them i used the radius and angles from my speakers\u00a0\u00a0 to make the templates to shape the\u00a0\nlegs and i like the way they came out\u00a0\u00a0 then decide how much elbow grease you want\u00a0\nto put into sanding these cheap pine studs step 6 is pre-assemble three and\u00a0\na half 63 and a half so it's good so yeah i'm going to pre-drill all of them\u00a0\nbecause if you just drive these screws\u00a0\u00a0 right through you're gonna end up splitting these coarse grit as i mentioned cheap wood will have twists\u00a0\nthat can show up in your final piece\u00a0\u00a0 leave a comment below if you want a video on how i\u00a0\nfixed it the only complicated cut you need to make\u00a0\u00a0 if you follow my plan is the cross halving mark\u00a0\nthe center mark the center mark here mark here\u00a0\u00a0 okay mark here i tried it without learning about\u00a0\nit because of course i'm overconfident and of\u00a0\u00a0 course i screwed it up again if you want\u00a0\na video on how i fixed it leave a comment\u00a0\u00a0 below the last couple of cuts that i'm going to\u00a0\nmake i'm just going to take the old top piece\u00a0\u00a0 from here and i'm going to trim that down and\u00a0\ni'm going to put it on the inside to back up\u00a0\u00a0 the the lateral support from the\u00a0\nbottom so that'll go right here\u00a0\u00a0 and i'm gonna make a cut along here and then you\u00a0\nknow mimic this distance up here so i'll have two\u00a0\u00a0 pieces to use as supports to hold the upright use\u00a0\nwater to raise the grain prior to staining step 7\u00a0\u00a0 disassemble for stain disassemble just enough\u00a0\nso you can stain before you use wood glue if you\u00a0\u00a0 get any glue on your raw wood it won't absorb\u00a0\nthe stain so make sure none of those surfaces\u00a0\u00a0 will be visible okay i'm going to use a 180 grit\u00a0\nsandpaper and go with the grain with the green water-based wood stain i'm going to stir all right pretty cool i like\u00a0\nthe way it came out step 8\u00a0\u00a0 is reassemble still be careful\u00a0\nnot to get glue everywhere i didn't use screws where\u00a0\nthey would show from the front so i had to hold the ply down until the glue dried another option is to use good looking screws all right i'm not happy i screwed this up i\u00a0\nslammed this down in here and i [i] chipped\u00a0\u00a0 this up uh all right well [ __ ] the\u00a0\ndamage is done i'm not redoing all this so boom that's it i started another\u00a0\ncoat of stain while the glue was still\u00a0\u00a0 wet the stain turned the glue black and\u00a0\nmade it blend right in when it dried is that drip driving you mad step\u00a0\n9 is the clear coat it clearly says\u00a0\u00a0 on the instructions don't shake it we don't want\u00a0\nto introduce air bubbles in there and it says it's\u00a0\u00a0 going to be milky white but it's going to dry\u00a0\nto a clear finish it also says wait two hours\u00a0\u00a0 for it to dry and then sand it with a 220 grit\u00a0\nsandpaper in order to ensure an even finish\u00a0\u00a0 okay so instead of that i'm going to do\u00a0\nlike i did with the black stain i'm going to\u00a0\u00a0 coat it once and i'm going to use the rag\u00a0\nto wipe it off the stain i used would rub\u00a0\u00a0 off with a wet cloth when it was unprotected\u00a0\nthat's why you need to put the clear coat on some 2x4 scraps underneath it's off the\u00a0\ncardboard won't stick to the cardboard now\u00a0\u00a0 and just let this dry overnight so while i didn't\u00a0\nfollow the recommended procedure i definitely\u00a0\u00a0 like the way it came out so you know it's got a\u00a0\nit's got a nice shine it's uh this is nice and\u00a0\u00a0 smooth maybe i got a little piece of dust in that\u00a0\nright there but that's pretty nice i like this\u00a0\u00a0 step 10 is mount your equipment make sure the bolts that hold your\u00a0\nbrackets on are going into the solid\u00a0\u00a0 wood structure that you built into the stand\u00a0\nfor that purpose i need to get an hdmi cable\u00a0\u00a0 power cable or whatever maybe\u00a0\ntwo three cables through here i'm going to mark this i just need to kind of square it off bring it down i'm just cleaning something up to make it\u00a0\nlook nice something that nobody will ever see but seriously i mean nobody's ever gonna see this\u00a0\nthat one's done and it's fine to do this bad boy mark and pre-drill for the wall mount bracket snug the bolts up and double check the bracket is\u00a0\nlevel i adjusted mine and put four more bolts in\u00a0\u00a0 mount the power strip inside the frame the wood frame of this design\u00a0\nmakes it easy to hide your wires\u00a0\u00a0 notice i use a total of eight\u00a0\nbolts better to be safe than sorry make sure they're all tight\u00a0\nattach the tv side bracket\u00a0\u00a0 mount the tv by hooking the tv\u00a0\nbracket over the wall bracket yeah that's freaking cool man i love it the tv\u00a0\nbracket should have some kind of locking device\u00a0\u00a0 mine had a couple of set screws adjust the angle and tighten the thumb screws my seating position is going to be eye level\u00a0\nwill be just a little bit lower than this\u00a0\u00a0 so you know either level or tilt it down a bit yes here's what it looks\u00a0\nlike from below the soundbar even from the side the\u00a0\nwires are pretty well hidden notice the shelf and wi-fi router and\u00a0\nthere you have it i only spent 103\u00a0\u00a0 using some materials i had on hand even if you\u00a0\nhave to buy all the materials on my list you'll\u00a0\u00a0 do this for under 250 and you'll end up with a\u00a0\npretty good looking tv stand that's sturdy enough\u00a0\u00a0 to hold this 53 pound tv this 40 pound sound bar\u00a0\nokay now

muscles leaky pie crusts and flavorless breads then it's time for baking measures 101 let me introduce you to my first secret ingredient the kitchen scale I have two types here a regular scale and the tea scale if you are new to weighing your ingredients start with a regular scale it works for all measurements that are not completely tiny basically it's a replacement for measuring cups and the tea scale is a replacement for measuring spoons there is no math involved with scales they all have a tear or zero button so you can set any Bowl on top zero it out and add your ingredients most scales let you choose the measurement unit so if your recipes and grams set it to grams and if it announces set it to answers the reason small quantities like salt are usually given in grams is to avoid hard to read fractions 1 gram is easier to read and write then 0.035 of an ounce of course you can weigh all your ingredients but the one that needs when the most is flour in the u.s. most people use dry measuring cups for flour let's see how well that works here is one cup of flour it weighs 164 grams and here is another cup of flour and it weighs 138 grams flour is a powder so it's compressible here is how the first cup was measured don't laugh I used to measure that way at some point that's the wrong way kids and here is how the second cup was measured I moved the flour into the container fluffed it up scooped it gently and leveled that's the right way let's do it again the right way to see how well that works 149 grams last time I got 138 grams so even the right way is not that a cure how much flour you get when measuring with cups can vary by as much as 20% depending on the container the cup how much you stir and the humidity conditions but what if your grandma didn't write you her chocolate chip cookie recipe in ounces or what if your favorite magazine is stuck in the dark ages using cups in cases like that assume that one cup of all-purpose flour equals 5 ounces 142 grams and those chocolate chip cookies will come out perfect every time now let's talk about flavor problems when the big goods are lacking in flavor people usually blame it on the quality of butter flour or eggs but the real culprit is usually the wrong amount of salt if your baking recipe does not specify the salt type they mean table salt the difference between salt types can be huge for example 1/2 teaspoon of table salt equals one teaspoon of diamond crystal kosher salt the difference between the measuring spoons can also be huge this is always 1 teaspoon in the US and this is also sold as one teaspoon let's see how similar they are I know I spelled a bit but we're not even close here so make sure to buy deep round teaspoons or get yourself a tea scale one teaspoon of table salt weighs 5.7 grams liquids can be weighed but can also be measured by volume since they are not compressible set a liquid measuring cup on a level surface and make sure the bottom of the meniscus is at the line to which you are measuring also make sure your eyes are level with that line oh it will be hard to judge the amount for more accurately measured advice don't forget to subscribe to Helens kitchen channel and if you're ever in the Boston area maybe I'll see you in one of my classes", "2FZgUC0F6XY": "when I was learning about shotguns I remember that gauge and all the different payloads was a little bit difficult for me to wrap my head around and so in this video we're gonna go over what each of those are I'm Chris Chang History Channel's Top Shot season four champion and professional marksman for Bass Pro Shops here we've got two different shotguns one's a 12-gauge and one's a 20 gauge and they're both Mossberg shotguns but how do we know which gauge is which at first glance they kind of look identical the way you tell is by looking at the stamping on the barrel it'll mention 20 gauge 12 gauge or there are other gauges available but 12 and 20 gauge are the common beginner gauges so now that we know how to determine your shotguns gauge let's take a look at what the ammo looks like here we have a 12 gauge round in the middle we have a 20 gauge round and on the end here we have actually another round which is a 410 round now the 410 round it's really small as you can see and typically it's more of an advanced round so I'm gonna set this aside and we're just going to talk about the 12 and 20 gauge round now the way this works I'm going to really simplify this for you is that be smaller the gauge number the larger the round so here is a 12 gauge round which is larger than the 20 gauge round another thing to take into consideration is your shotgun shell length two and three-quarter inch or three inch shells are common but they can go as large as three and a half inches as well this will also be noted on the side of your shotgun barrel so make sure that your shotgun shell length matches whatever stamped on your barrel now to talk about payloads we've got three common payloads right in front of us here we have birdshot buckshot and slugs now with birdshot as you can see here it's these smaller bb's which are common in competition in hunting and also in trap skeet and sporting clays in the middle here we have buckshot which were these larger bb's common in home defense and hunting and then finally we have slugs which are these huge chunks of metal basically really similar to a bullet let's talk now about the composition of a shotgun shell and what's happening here now when the shell is inside of a shotgun on the end here we have a primer in the center of the shell here now when you pull the trigger a firing pin gets released and hits that primer now what happens the primer ignites there's a small little spark that goes off inside we now then have gunpowder in this part of the shell there is a plastic wad that is holding the payload and the payload is all the way in the end of the front of the shell so let's take a closer look at the inside of a shell now that you know what's going on I've got a shell that I've already cut open so I'm going to lift off the outside part there and see a bunch of that shot come out here's a bunch of that shot and alright throw it over the left shoulder for good luck here is that what I was talking about all right made out of plastic and then finally we've got the powder all in there as well alright so now that you have an understanding of gauge and the different payloads birdshot buckshot and slugs if you're looking for a place to shoot check out where to shoot dorg to find a range near you and finally always remember that firearm safety depends on you", "9UVgO8zS474": "So right here we've listed two\nquantities or two fluid volumes right over here in terms\nof gallons, 1 gallon and 2 gallons. And what I want to\ndo in this video is try to convert this quantity\nof fluid, this volume of fluid, I want to convert it into\nthese other units within the US customary system. So I encourage you\nto pause the video and first try to\ndo the 1 gallon. Try to convert it into quarts,\npints, cups, and fluid ounces. Well, 1 gallon is\nequal to 4 quarts. So we can just multiply by 4. 1 quart is equal to 2 pints,\nso we can multiply this by 2. So 4 quarts, each\nof them are 2 pints. 4 times 2 gets us to 8 pints. Each pint is equal to 2\ncups, so we have 8 pints. Each of them are\nequal to 2 cups. We're going to have 16 cups. And then finally, if we're\nconverting from a cup to a fluid ounce, each\ncup is 8 fluid ounces. So if we have 16 cups, it's\ngoing to be 16 times 8. 8 times 8 is 64, and it's\ngoing to be twice that. That's going to be\n128 fluid ounces. Now, let's do the same\nthing with 2 gallons. Try to convert that into quarts,\npints, cups, and fluid ounces. And I encourage you\nto pause the video and try it on your own first. Well, same idea. 1 gallon is equivalent\nto 4 quarts. So 2 gallons are going to be\n2 times 4 quarts, or 8 quarts. quart is 2 pints. So if we want to go\nfrom quarts to pints, we'd want to multiply by 2. So this is going to be 16 pints. And then each pint is 2 cups. So multiplying 16 of them, then\nthat's going to be 32 cups. And then finally,\neach cup is 8 ounces. 32 times 8 is going to be? Let's see, it's going to be 256. And notice something here. When we went from 1\ngallon to 2 gallons, we essentially increased the\nquantity of gallons by 2, or we multiplied by 2. And you see that\nacross the board here as it's going from\n4 quarts to 8 quarts. This is going from\n8 pints to 16 pints. This is going from\n16 cups to 32 cups, going from 128\nfluid ounces to 256. When you increase the volume\nin gallons by a factor of 2, you're, of course, going\nto increase the volume in any unit you measure\nit in by a factor of 2.", "b1GlxS5f9WI": "hi guys this is John from Waltons TV and this is meet Geist ik's summer sausage is a semi dried sausage that's typically stuffed into a large diameter casing like a fibrous casing most summer sausage has a low pH which gives it that familiar tangy type flavor pH varies Ken value but somewhere between four point five to five point two this also helps aid in some shelf stability besides pH water activity can also help determine whether a product is truly shelf stable or not which means in summer sausage we need to bind water in the meat snacks and make it unavailable for microbial growth water activity is not something that can be measured by a home processor but we will still set up our process and thermal processing to attempt to achieve a lower water activity summer sausage can be made using a variety of meats and anything like wild game venison beef pork poultry combination doesn't matter we just want to make sure that we're somewhere around 20 percent fat sometimes that fat can go up to 30 or 40 percent but we like to shoot for somewhere around 20 percent to keep it at least somewhat healthy fat is where most of your flavor comes from so changing your lean to fat ratio will change the overall taste and the mouthfeel of your product so I'm going to be using a beef and pork mix about 5050 I've already cut everything up we're all ready to go you can use 20 pounds of wild game and 5 pounds of pork fat or whatever make sure you want just make sure again that your fat ratio is somewhere around 20 percent or greater otherwise you're going to have a dry and not quite as tasteful product we're going to use X calibers harbor or habanero barbecue summer sausage seasoning we're gonna add an ounce of sure cure we're gonna add some carrot fiber we're gonna put in 2 pounds of high temp cheese 4 pints of water and we're also gonna use encapsulated citric acid to give it that tang that's what changes the pH aside from the seasonings and additives we're also going to need a grinder a mixer a stuffer a meatlug to hold the meat fibers casings to stuff them in hog rings and hog ring pliers to close up the meat and all these items and more are available waltons ENCOM this is also when we're going to prepare our casings they need to soak in hot water for about thirty minutes to let them soften up so that when we stuff them there'll be some give to them one other note this is all fresh out of the freezer I did put the grinder head the plate and knife and the auger in the freezer and let it sit in there for a couple hours just to get them as cold as possible because we want to keep heat down throughout the grinding process that's going to improve the quality of our me I'm gonna grind this meat twice the first grind I'm gonna do is a 3/8 or 10 millimeter grinder plate and the second grind is going to be a 1/8 or 3 millimeter grinder plate a sharp grinder knife and plate are key to help you create a better summer sausage by helping you retain better particle definition color and it's going to help prevent any smearing of the meat so the meats also very cold that's helping this grind nice and easily you can see great particle definition in this I did that by putting it in our blast freezer you probably don't have a blast freezer at home so if you just put it in your regular freezer for about 45 minutes to an hour somewhere around there you can get the same effect as I did so I'm done with the first grind now I'm just going to switch out the plate from the 10 millimeter to the 3 millimeter so we can get our second grind a meat mixer is your best option for meat mixing when making summer sausage we need to not only thoroughly mix in the seasoning spices and whatever other additives we used but we also need to achieve good protein extraction protein extraction is visibly noticeable when the meat starts to get real sticky or tacky is another word for it what this does is allows the proteins in the meat to bind with the water and fat giving your sausage a better consistency and mouthfeel when eating plus it helps it from getting dry and crumbly hand mixing is possible but it's difficult to achieve the same result as using an actual meat mixer for the mixing time we need to mix for a total of about eight minutes there's a lot of factors that I can enter into this though so that 8 minutes may or may not be true for what you're doing during the mixing process we want to use a reverse motion for every minute that we go forward the other things we want to do is add our encapsulated citric acid and cheese if you're using any last this is important because the cheese could start to break down and you don't want to break the capsule on the citric acid or it's gonna start working in the meat too early so just add those in the last 45 to 60 seconds somewhere right around there two quarts of water works really well if you're using wild game that has a lower fat content it's going to make the product a little bit soupier and a lot easier to stuff now that Sioux penis will come out during the cooking process it'll still firm up fine or just stuff a lot easier however if you're using pork or the proper you know 20 percent or slightly above fat ratio 2 pints of water is totally fine so wild game with low fat content use 2 quarts pork or higher fat content 2 pints should be fine we're all done mixing we got good protein extraction now as long as our casings have been soaking for at least 30 minutes we're ready to stuff avoid creating air pockets when you load your sausage stuffer and begin stuffing until the casings are full with a smooth exterior remember to leave a little bit extra on the end of the fibrous casing so that you can twist and clip them tightly closed with a pair of hog ring pliers since we use encapsulated citric acid on ours we were able to go right to the smokehouse if you didn't use encapsulated citric acid or some other type of care accelerator you need to hold your product overnight before smoking to let the cure work in the meat now when you do go to the smokehouse you can either hang them on smoke sticks or lay them on racks in your oven or smokehouse just be sure to leave a slight gap between your summer sausages to allow the air to fully circulate around you can also place a small pan of water in the bottom of the smokehouse during the entire cooking cycle this is going to help you increase humidity and prevent stall outs a simple cooking schedule you can follow is 125 degrees for an hour don't really need smoke at this point then 140 degrees with an hour and you shouldn't introduce smoke then 155 degrees for two hours and then bump your smokehouse or oven up to 175 until the internal temperature of your meat is 160 if you're a smokehouse or a dry or dehydrated or whatever can't do temperatures as low as 125 just start as low as possible and slow we increase the temperature over time what we're trying to do here is prevent the outside of the summer sausage from cooking too quickly and then it's not going to want to pass heat along to the center so you'll end up with a real dry hard product on the outside and a raw product in the middle now to help set the casing to the meat and to prevent wrinkling we need to shower the summer sausage when we're done cooking or put them in an ice water bath should only take about 10 to 15 minutes to get the temperature to drop down this also is going to stop the cooking process then set them out for about an hour room temperature before moving them to the refrigerator or to the freezer after we're totally done with the cooking process then you can package it in vacuum pouches for longer-lasting and throw them in the freezer for you at that point now I made two different ones here I made one with cheese and one without both of them are excellent the habanero barbecue summer sausage is a phenomenal seasoning I love it is my favorite summer sausage up whenever we do any summer sausage that's always what I want but with the cheese it definitely does add something in my opinion as always make sure you subscribe to Waltons TV and remember to tap the bell next to the subscribe button to get notified about all new videos

This just looks too damn good. mmmm....mmmmm That's good, I'm gonna spin this burger around when I shoot so you don't see that giant bite I just took out of it. Oh, well. All right. Let's let's start that over. Hey guys, Tim with Kitchen & Craft and today we're discussing the secret on how to make a better Beyond Burger. You know those plant-based meat patties that you find all over the place nowadays. By the way, this video is a collaboration with Marlon Doll. His channel focuses on healthy, tasty and affordable meals. So take a look at his version of the ultimate Beyond Burger when you're done watching my video. I'll leave a link toward the end for you. Marlon, and I would love to hear what burger you prefer. So leave a comment on either channel and let us know which is your favorite Beyond Burger. All right back to the discussion. This is my first time using this type of product and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed. They've done a great job imitating the look and the texture of beef but I gotta say it doesn't necessarily kill it on flavor for me. I mean. you can't just cook one of these burgers off, slap it between two buns, squirt some ketchup on it and call it a day. It's just not going to do it. So my secret is to pair it with high quality, highly flavorful, delicious ingredients. It doesn't sound like a huge secret, but there's plenty of people that'll go for a plain-jane burger and be sorely disappointed. with flavor aside, I think the biggest story here is the sustainability of beyond burger products in relation to beef. But that's a discussion for another day and quite frankly a different Channel All right back to the burger. Beyond Meat has done 90% of the work for us when it comes to the patty. They've made the burger and they pre-formed it. All we got to do is cook it so most of this video is gonna be about all of the other things that I'm pairing with it. I'm gonna knock out some delicious, super soft hamburger buns. We're gonna make some quick homemade ranch dressing I'll shred some lettuce and slice some red onion and let's not forget his spicy cucumber pickles. The recipe of which I will leave in the upper right-hand side of this video. This particular burger might not be vegan or vegetarian, but it certainly can be with some quick substitutions. It's my version of a better Beyond Burger and it's damn delicious so I hope you like it. It's time to check out my recipe so let's go. Hey guys, welcome to my video on the secret to making a better Beyond Burger. Hint...it's all about the fixin's. Alright, we're gonna kick things off by adding some warm water to a mixing bowl. The water should be about a 100\u00b0F. Add a little bit of sugar, stir that around to dissolve it and then go in with your yeast. Let that bloom for about five minutes, then add the remaining sugar, your kosher salt, all of the unsalted butter, which should be at room temp, one egg, then all of your flour. If you have a stand mixer go ahead and attach your bowl with the dough hook. If you don't no worries at all. This is really easy to mix by hand. I just happen to have a stand mixer So, you know, it'd be silly for me not to use it. If you're using a KitchenAid mixer turn it to setting number two. I find this is the best setting when kneading dough . At first, this dough's gonna look kind of dry and then it's gonna start to get shaggy and eventually everything is just gonna come together and you'll have a beautiful dough. But if for some reason the dough is too wet or dry, you can add some flour or water a little bit at a time until it comes together to the right consistency. So after about 10 minutes of kneading your dough should look exactly like this. It should be silky smooth in texture, have pulled away from the sides of the bowl, but the dough should still sort of be sticking to the bottom of the bowl. Now it's time to generously flour your work surface and turn the dough out on to it. Continue kneading for a few minutes by pulling the edges of the dough and folding them in toward the center. Then, flip the dough over and start rolling It counterclockwise or clockwise Doesn't really matter, but roll it with your hands to form a dough ball. Place your dough ball in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic film or a wet towel and let it double in size. It should take about an hour. Alright, once again, turn your dough out onto a floured work surface and cut it into eight pieces. They should weigh approximately 80 grams each. This weight works perfectly for the Beyond burger patty sizes. If you want larger buns, cut the dough into six pieces that weigh about a hundred grams each and they'll be a much more appropriate for half-pound burger sizes. Place your dough balls on a parchment lined sheet pan and arrange them using the 2-1-2 to layout. Then press each bun down a little bit. That'll keep them from puffing up too much on their second rise. Hit each piece of dough with a little bit of cooking spray or brush them with oil. This is gonna keep them from sticking to the plastic that you need to cover the dough with so it doesn't dry out during its second rise. Okay, after an hour or so your buns should have doubled in size. The final step before baking is to brush each bun with some egg wash. Be delicate here. You don't want to press too hard or you'll deflate the dough and then you just have to start all over again. Or you could just admit defeat and go to the store and buy some potato rolls. After 15 minutes in a 400\u00b0F oven, this is what your buns will look like. Not too shabby eh? Place them on a baking rack and then cover them with a towel. Let the buns rest for about 15-20 minutes so they can cool off and soften up a bit. Now, on to some good old ranch dressing. Add your sour cream, your mayonnaise, your dried herbs and spices, some salt and pepper and a little bit of buttermilk, then stir until everything's combined. As an optional ingredient you can add some lemon zest or a little bit of lemon juice. That'll give the dressing a brighter note. But again, totally optional. Go ahead and place that ranch in a container and store it in the fridge until your burgers are ready. We are moving on with our topping prep by shredding some lettuce, slicing some red onion and grabbing some of those super delicious spicy cucumber pickles that you can make with a recipe that I will leave in the upper right-hand side of this video. And I almost forgot the American cheese. Not so elegant with a serrated knife am I? Anyways, when your buns cool off, cut one in half, butter it up and toast it off on a preheated griddle. Now ladies and gents, it's time for the main event. Grab your Beyond Meat patties, season one side up with some salt and pepper, brush it with some oil and slap it on the griddle. Make sure your patty has good contact with the griddle. That'll help with browning and improve the flavor. When you're ready to flip, season the patty with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then add a drizzle of oil and proceed. After about three minutes of cooking on each side, it's time to add your cheese. I'm going for a quick melt here so I need some steam and a bowl to help me with that. Now that the buns and the rancher made, the toppings are sliced, the patties cooked and the cheese is melted, it's time to build this burger. I really hope you enjoyed the video.

resistance just one coat will give you a beautiful clear glass like finish in vertex light is available in a range of different sizes the one gallon kit is ideal for coating bars and tabletops while the half gallon kit exclusive to large projects but for smaller projects such as placemats photo frames and clocks a smaller kit will be sufficient to calculate the amount of resin you need measure your project dimensions and use ET is online flood Coast calculator it's always best to mix a little more in very excite than you need you'll need a painters drop sheet of protective eyewear graduated measuring mixing cup stirred 6 with a flat end a disposable brush a handheld barbecue lighter and in biotechs lights for larger projects you can use a chef's butane torch instead make sure you use cups with smooth flat walls and a flat bottom this will aid with proper mixing avoid wax-coated cups as the wax can peel away and contaminate the resins apply not absorbent tape or a generous coat of paste wax to the back edges of the projects once the ribbon has cured you can remove the tape along with any drips and it will leave a clean edge behind protect your workspace with a drop sheet or several layers of newspaper elevate the item approximately 2 inches above the work area making sure it's level this will allow the resin to self level and any excess to flow over the edges of the project and vertex light works best when the room temperature is between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit if the bottles are present feel cool to the touch warm them up in warm tap water for 5 to 10 minutes if you mix the resin when it's cold it will result in a cloudy finish filled with microscopic bubbles now put on your gloves and protective eyewear and measure out one part of resin and one part of hardener it's important that you measure each part exactly even if you need the whole kit for your project here you can see that there is slightly more resin list than hardness mix the resin and hardener together four to four minutes making sure you scrape down the walls and bottom of the container to free any unmixed resin that's fair occasionally scrape off perfect now transfer the resin into the second container and stir for another full minute with a clean stir stick pour the resin evenly over your project and carefully work it out to the edges with the long side of a stir stick or a business card use a disposable brush to smooth out the drifts along the side edges you will need to repeat this until the coating is firm enough that it no longer drips and biotech life and self level provided you have applied enough resin to the surface bubbles will rise to the surface of the coating and about 15 minutes after pouring you can pop these by gently exhaling on them or by passing a flame over the surface use a gentle sweeping motion until a bubbles are gone you can do this again if needed while the resin is still liquid allow the resin to cure in a warm dust free place where it won't be disturbed here I've elevated a piece of cardboard over the project and then draped it with a drop sheet to keep dust away from the curing resin it will take 8 hours to reach soft cure and approximately 72 hours to reach hard cure with just one coat application and biotechs light will give you a beautiful glass like finish [Music]", "TjwCXJqeYrI": "Oh beak today okay hello everybody welcome back to my channel so as I promised in my hair science video today I am bringing you the ultimate down-low on the apple cider vinegar herons I have tried this in three different ways until I found the perfect way to do it I am so thrilled to be able to say that I have a sponsor for this video it gives me absolute pleasure to share with you these fantastic design yo prints a couple of years ago I saw a framed print of this lion in a vlog on YouTube I don't know what it was about this image but I felt so moved by it and I looked for it everywhere online but I couldn't find it so I was so happy to find it in the design yo shop like two years later there's just something about this lion his facial expression and the movement of his Mane that feels so incredibly humble so I'm so pleased to now have this image in my home if you'd like to get 20 pipe 20 pipe if you'd like to get 25% off your prints you can use the code Isabella DeMarco but make sure you're quick because this code is only valid for three days and expires on the 31st of October unfortunately not to worry though some of these prints are really quite affordable just on their own you don't have to buy a frame if you just want to use it as a poster does any oh do thousands of prints they do animals cities nature artwork they do the classics they've got a bit of Marilyn Monroe and they do a lot of abstract art so there's definitely something for everyone and in many different sizes and frames to choose from it was so hard to choose but I adore mountains and pine tree forests so I just like to surround myself by images that I find inspiring and compelling I also chose this image of a whale whenever I am stressing or anxious I always find comfort in the thought that somewhere in a vast body of water there's just a whale chillin floating peacefully it just makes me feel so calm you can really make any space look so sophisticated and put together with prints these as well as injecting a little bit of your personal style into a room it's also a very tasteful gift idea so I actually got one for my mum so she picked out these cute black lips with a gold frame a huge thank you to decennial for sponsoring this video it's so wonderful that creators can be supported for what we do and I don't need to tell you guys this but of course I will only work with brands that I believe are worth sharing so I hope that you will enjoy does any Oh back to the ish so in my last video we discussed hair pH and water type and I concluded that my hair pH balance is out of whack and yours might be as well so apple cider vinegar also known as a CV is known for having so many health benefits and it's been used for various natural health remedies since ancient Greece this brown murky stuff is known as the mother this is where all the good stuff is and though I found many blogs saying that it's packed with vitamins and minerals I will say that there were a few articles disproving this due to the fermentation process it doesn't actually keep all of its vitamins such as vitamin C however it does contain natural protein enzymes healthy bacteria and acetic acid so make sure to shake this up before use and if you're AC V is clear it means it's been filtered and may not have as much nutrients so look for raw unfiltered unpasteurized pasteurized ACV now I am NOT a doctor I am NOT a hair specialist so the information that I'm sharing with you today is all self researched based off of the data collected from 13 articles to specialist studies and my own firsthand experimentation I've spent many many extra hours trying to make sure that this information is as legitimate as possible so if that's something you appreciate please thumbs up the video and as usual all the sources are linked below now pay attention to this because this is backed by science so due to the low pH level of around 3 in apple cider vinegar it can be used to help close the hair cuticle by lowering the pH in our hair you may remember in my last video I explained that healthy hair is slightly more acidic with a pH of around 4.5 to 5.5 well the International Journal of trichology released a study on the effects of pH in our hair products they say that alkaline pH may increase the negative electrical charge of the hair fiber surface they go on to say it's a reality and not a myth that lower pH of shampoos may cause less frizzing for generating less negative static electricity on the fiber surface when I read this study everything just made sense high alkaline products and hard water types are higher on the pH scale which causes the hair cuticle to open this is what causes hair to become brittle and dry which in turn causes split ends breakage and the dreaded frizz which seems to be my main issue at the moment so by closing the hair cuticle ACV is known to help retain moisture decrease frizz add shine increased softness helps remove product and dirt buildup which is said to help you go longer between washes it unclogs the hair follicles which may help with excess shedding stimulates your scalp helps with dandruff helps soothe an itchy scalp and con treat scalp infections oh my god my eyelash there are only prime like pi Mike I can't talk today they're just Primark lashes hi Mike some people believe that it can also promote hair growth and prevents hair loss specialist at the Belgravia Center which is a UK facility for hair loss say that there is no evidence to support this however they can confirm it's clarifying ability so it's thought that it's clarifying and unclogging effect as well as its ability to stimulate the scalp is what leads people to believe that it could put your hair in a better position to grow and shed less as a cv is highly acidic it's important not to overuse it and it must be diluted with water to bring the pH up to around 4 for hair answers but the main problem that I found when researching this method was finding the right ratio of a CV to water people's ratios were all over the shop every single article I read said something completely friend this article says one-third of a cup of a CV - four cups of water this one says one teaspoon of a CV - one cup of water this one says one part to one part I mean personally I think this is not right so please don't do this so I went into my kitchen and I measured out every single ratio I could find online from this I could only determine what I thought looked like a sensible ratio to use many of the articles did mention that sometimes you've got a play around a little bit to find what works for you but according to quite a few articles I read dry hair likes less ACV and greasy hair like some more a CV so in the end I went with around five tablespoons of a CV in one cup of water this measures around one ounce of a CV to eight ounces of water so it's about a 1 to 8 ratio after this whole experiment I decided to use even less a CV for my future rinses and I'm gonna tell you why towards the end of the video so keep watching so the method after shampooing and conditioning I poured the rinse over my scalp making sure to saturate all of my hair you can use it warm but I chose to use a cold rinse because this is said to help close the cuticle and add shine generally most directions instruct using it at the end of your routine but some people say you can use the rinse in place of your shampoo or in place of your conditioner because it has both clarifying and conditioning effects but as my hair is really troubled I didn't really want to skip Eva steps so I just used it at the very end now to rinse out or not to rinse out almost every article and recipe I came across instructed to rinse out the vinegar and it seems like the only legitimate reason for this is because of the smell only a few articles suggested leaving it in and to be honest with you I actually believe leaving it in is the better way to do this rinse because water has a higher pH it just seems like I'd be defeating the purpose of the a CV to rinse out and yes it does smell quite strong even with just the small amount that I used but it's not noticeable at all when it dries and I'm gonna show you how I fix to the smell in my second attempt so after so my hair I squeezed it all out I showered off any vinegar from my body because I didn't want to smell and I just let my hair air dry with the vinegar in it on each attempt I do exactly the same thing I gently comb out my hair and do absolutely nothing else to it then leave it to air dry completely naturally and for those of you saying brushing wet hair is damaging it totally depends on how you do it for curly and wavy hair it's actually better to gently detangle with a comb while it's wet so just think about these things before you make claims like this so as you can see my hair was still frizzy still pretty much how it looks like when it air dries normally but I will say it was a little bit softer and less tangled however it just wasn't the effect that I was hoping for so for my second attempt I used exactly the same measurements but this time I used bottled water I didn't realize this when I bought it but this one actually has a pH of seven point nine which is higher than I would have ideally liked I have no idea what the pH of my shower water is but I know that it's hard water which means it's anywhere from eight point five upwards now to help with the smell some recipes recommend adding an essential oil like lavender or rosemary or peppermint was also recommended I decided to use a bit of lavender oil the recipes just say to add a few drops I accidently added about five drops but I found that this massively masked the vinegar smell again though it was pretty much the same outcome as before after air drying it it was still pretty frizzy and as you can see it's drying kind of curly I think my hair is just changing texture I don't know what's going on my hair guys anyway with this one I did notice that my hair looked quite a bit shinier and there didn't seem to be any oil residue from the lavender oil even though I used more than it was recommended it also smelled really nice so I definitely approve using essential oils for this rinse my third attempt ladies and gentlemen is where I noticed the biggest difference and this was simply from just changing to contributing factors now I used exactly the same measurements but this time I had finally bought a water filter so I used filtered water to make this rinse and I also rinsed my hair with filtered water before the apple cider vinegar rinse to make sure I had got rid of any hard water left in my hair the second factor i changed was aftercare now again after air drying it looked pretty much like the same old frizzy curly mess but this time i put my hair up in a protective style afterwards after a few hours i took my hair out and you can see the visual difference in my hair now i hadn't done this with the other attempts for the purpose of this experiment but this is actually something I would normally do daily and especially after air drying frizzy girls out there you will understand the struggle but it would never look this shiny and sleek after taking out so I definitely noticed it was working shortly after this I went to bed and instead of wearing a protective hairstyle as I usually do I tried a silk cap for the first time and this was the result okay I've just woken up after wearing my hair in a silk cap all night I didn't put it up I just twisted my hair and put it in that I haven't even touched my hair yet this is what it looks like it looks smoother man I never wake up with my hair this smooth what's going on so oh damn oh man oh man yeah there's like a few little you know waves in it where I've slept on it but overall it doesn't smell as much as it did yesterday but look how shiny it is dude look how shiny and I'm so impressed I think that was the one that like got it my hair felt sleek it was glossy it was bouncy and the individual strands actually felt stronger I was really really so surprised it was soft and it was not tangley at all it was just like a whole new head of hair so weird so it definitely seemed like the aftercare played a huge factor in the outcome and yes I do use these after chem efforts regularly and I don't notice results quite as nice as this so I know that the a CV played a huge part in its glossiness and its texture it may very well have been the filtered water that made a big difference as well also maybe just the fact that it was my third a CV rinse that week now I wouldn't actually recommend doing three a CV rinses in a week but it was just for the purpose of this experiment so here's a recap to make sure that you get the best result from an a CV rinse please note that if your hair is color treated you may want to find an alternative rinse or just use a lot less a CV it said that because the acetic acid in the rinse is a strong clarifier it could strip your hair of its color but I did find another article saying that it's not strong enough to affect your hair color so I'll leave the articles down below so you can do your own research on that one use filtered or distilled water in your rinse filtered water is going to neutralize hard water which tends to be more alkaline so this will maximize the effect the rinse has on closing the cuticle because it keeps the pH down and distilled water is actually fairly acidic already because it has no dissolved solids in it so if you can get your hands on distilled water that's probably going to be the best thing to use in your rinse use your rinse cold if you can stand it I'd always recommend to do your final rinse with cold water it is known to help close the cuticle and add shine which is just gonna maximize the benefits of the rinse getting the perfect ratio between one to four tablespoons of a CV in one to two cups of water seems to be the most agreed upon amount but to be safe the main rule is to make sure your rinse is brought up to a pH of four I could not test what the pH level of the rinse that I used was I'm going to update you in the description once I have tested that just remember that it's recommended that for dry hair you use a bit less and for greasy how you use a bit more but it's worth experimenting because everyone's hair is different how often to use the rinse I could not find any scientific or legitimate advice on how often to use it but most of the articles suggest using it anywhere from twice a week to twice a month totally depending on how your hair reacts to it although I will note that specialists from the Belgravia Center state care should be taken to avoid stripping the hair of its natural oils doing so can make the hair appear thin and brittle leading to hair breakage in some severe instances so with this in mind personally I would use this rinse about once every one to two weeks if you are going to use this as much as twice a week I'd recommend just using a smaller ratio maybe one to two tablespoons one to two teaspoons per one cup of filtered water and if you have short hair I would just divide this in half another interesting thing I found about hair pH is that the pH of your hair is actually very different to the pH of your scalp according to the International Journal of trichology study the hair shaft itself has a pH of 3.67 whilst the scalp is slightly less acidic at 5.5 which I'm guessing is why the general hair pH is said to be four point five to five point five fixing the smell you know if you've got your girlfriend or your boyfriend round you don't stink up the shower because it does smell so strong it's nice to know that you can just add essential oils and finally proper aftercare protective styles always help in decreasing frizz and as the results show it worked particularly well to really show off the benefits of this rinse so there you have it practically all of the information I could find on apple cider vinegar packed into one video hopefully this video has armed you with a few more helpful facts and just a better idea of how you can approach using it but remember that it's worth experimenting if you

lockdown and so this was a great dessert choice it's so easy to make one stick of butter that's eight tablespoons of butter in a oven safe dish we're gonna put that in the oven to melt the butter while that's melting we're gonna get a mixing bowl and add one cup of all-purpose flour or you could use self-rising flour but I'm using regular all-purpose flour and so now we want to add some sugar I've got a 1/3 cup measuring cup and I'm gonna put two scoops in so that's 2/3 a cup of sugar and if you like yours really sweet then just add a whole cup of sugar instead of 2/3 anyway we'll put that in and we're going to add one and a half teaspoons of baking powder because this is regular all-purpose flour and then also 1/8 teaspoon of salt and we're gonna go now and stir that up just really simple get those ingredients combined just like that and then to 1 cup of milk I'm going to add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and then pour it in the flour mixture simple huh very easy dessert and then stir this up get it nice and combined like that it's a nice thin batter see all right now we're gonna go ahead and open this can of blueberry pie filling blueberry pie filling it's 21 ounces let's check and see if that butter is melted yeah it looks about right so we're gonna bring that dish out and be very careful because it is just extremely hot and now it's time to pour the batter in and do it right in the middle just pour that all in scrape that out just like that very very easy and now it's time to add the blueberry pie filling and just get a spoon and distribute it out in the dish I'll speed this up it's a lot of filling no it's so good if you like blueberries so we'll get that all spread out and you don't want to stir it or anything like that just put it in and then we're gonna put it in this preheated oven 350 degrees for about 50 minutes and then it's ready just like that and that is bubbling hot so we'll let that cool off a little bit before we give it a taste mmm all right there you have it some beautiful blueberry cobbler look at that we'll just dish this up it's still pretty hot I could have waited a little longer but I wanted to give it a taste one more spoonful that looks about right hmm wonderful okay now for the taste test oh that's so good very delicious blueberry cobbler so simple to make well I hope you give this a try thanks for watching we'll see you next time bye now [Music]", "Or80UcDcmww": "hi there this state Warner from Warner boxy today I'm going to show you how to mix the epoxy crack wait what happens if you under mix epoxy it will not harden you have to mix it enough long enough to get it mixed thoroughly otherwise it will die hard it'll look the same it just will not hurt and make sure you read these directions on your epoxy make sure what ratio mix it today we will be mixing our racial one to one we're going to start off with our hardener first Darby and we're going to end equal notes and we're going to add like 20 ounces of each one today [Music] there's hardener said four so I don't mix up and put the same one name twice I've done that before did not work when you're figuring out how much epoxy to use we use three ounces per square foot of surface area that you're doing so if you're doing one square foot you do three ounces of epoxy all right this is one thing I do accurately measure I don't act as measured paints but now when you mix make sure you hold your container because it will spit out and you will have a boxy everywhere plunge it all the way to the bottom start it slow [Music] [Music] I'm the halfway done now I'm going to go a little bit slower and I'm going to mix the sides in the bottom make sure we get it all [Applause] [Music] we mix it for two minutes for good measures I'm going to do the edges one more time at slow speed all the way to the bottom that is the correct way on how to mix epoxy now if you don't have one of these mixer paddles you can get it from my link

put it into your where you can mix all your dry ingredients just have the carrots last you as soon as you mix it with the carrots it should get nice and smooth you so now for the icing you need a it's a cream cheese frosting you're gonna need 1/8 ounce of packaged cream cheese which is in the bowl 1/2 stick of butter you need it melted and powdered sugar to stiffen it now we mix don't forget to add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and do it now you're going to start adding the vanilla extract a little at a time also I have adult supervision in this now are you gonna do this is you're gonna grab all this and as you're mixing it you're going to add in your powdered sugar to stiffen so you have your cream cheese and then you get a sifter to sift on powdered sugar and then you want to mix it my powdered sugar all over my hands but it's okay taste it along the way as well let's make sure it's got sweet and then you're gonna grab a sifter as I said and put it in there look we're making carrot cake after a while you still get it mixed enough where it looks creamy don't add too much fat or sugar otherwise it's gonna be sugar central now what you're gonna do is you're going to grab a spoon and little containers and some food dye because we are gonna make the carrot for the orange are dropped yellow and a drop of red and now we're going to if you want your colors to be light you can make your colors to be light but for the green we added two drops and now for the orange we're going to darken it by adding another drop and now we our colors and if you were wondering what recipe I am following for all of this I am actually using a recipe that was used back in the day during the Depression I'll show you the book in a second and this is actually the book I was surprised when I saw as well also a little bit of frou tip so I put mine in little containers for everybody to get one um this one has raisins by the way and so I hate a mine up for forty minutes and I took mine out five minutes before they were done cuz when you take it out it's still baking so if you want it to be nice and fluffy just do that so now they're out of the oven on a cooling rack just wait for them to all cool so you can put your frosting and carrot now you can do whatever design you want but I'm just gonna like pipe something simple maybe polka dots or something random yes I covered my carrot I can redo it wait for any cake you can do a standard little circle and then you can obviously grab your frostings again and go back to it like for this one for instance so you can grab your orange just pipe it back on sanfur this one baking with me you", "UWXpimc7zsA": "hey guys nick murray here how's it going uh i'm finally back in the studio after being quarantined away for a long time and i'm

for now and those are just different synth sounds uh okay claps we got 30 of them [Music] okay so for me i hear a lot of uh nice crisp and clean claps but kind of hard hitting as well sounds really cool um let's look briefly at the effects and textures that's kind of just whatever [Music] okay that's those kind of things [Music] textures all right hats uh hat rolls now of course those aren't going to be tempo mapped to your song or your beat so uh maybe just make your own out of these guys let's listen to the closed hi-hats so i like how there's more of these uh there's 35 in this folder then we've got one called mid which has let's see 10 more and then open of course so it's 25 so a lot of uh small variations but different flavors to to try out let's see what this oh these certain doesn't say mid sorry it says midi so these are uh just uh midi files you can drag into your session so there's no sound there's no samples right there okay open so quite a few reverse ones already there's three out of the top out of the first six that are reversed so six reversed ones that's kind of interesting seeing as you can reverse any sample you want on your own okay kicks let's see if how punchy and awesome these are there's 40 of them here here we go [Music] all right nice uh cool all right lots of good stuff in there let's check out one shots so these are pretty much just one note samples from other instruments so you'd have to map those out uh as well kind of like the 808s if you want to use them melodically okay so that's that idea uh perk [Music] so again quite a random selection um for me perk is not as important of category as like the kicks 808s claps and hats and snares which we'll get to uh perk of course you can just use any any type of samples for for percussion variations all right so that's that idea perk rolls again not tempo synced so uh do what you will with those rim shots these are actually really useful that's good stuff so that'll give kind of nice accented syncopated rhythms to like your snares and claps and stuff okay let's see what these random samples are so these have tempos 116. and of course you can tempo map those or time stretch them to your tempo [Music] okay snaps [Music] so either reverb or delay on most of those that one doesn't that one doesn't number three kind of has a room reverb maybe uh so that's interesting if there it would be cool if there was like a dry and a wet folder okay snares let's check some of these out [Music] i like that one number 20. [Music] that one's cool too number 31 is really usable sounds like [Music] [Music] whoa all right so those are super cool definitely some usable stuff in there uh i kind of already want to start playing around with with that and start creating some beats here um okay vox all right this kind of stuff doesn't get me going uh it sounds quite generic stuff that's been around for years and years uh okay let's see what this bonus folder is [Music] it just says bonus drums so it's random stuff you could pop that on one big sampler instrument or you could like rename each of them and put them back in different categories over here like uh your kick snares hats whatever we got more hat midis uh which we could put in that same folder from before and then we've got with a bonus samples non-clearance let's see what these all right so again that's just kind of stuff that you use at your own risk because if you use melodic samples chances are if someone else does it's gonna sound the same um but the other stuff like the like i said 808s kicks uh i liked the rim shots the claps the snaps the snares and the hi-hats all really cool stuff so maybe in my next video i'll show you how to how to pop these into a sampler in logic and how to make a quick sampler instrument so you can play these across your keyboard um and you know choose stuff really quickly so you don't have to go through and do it on finder and drag and drop files all the time um so that'll do it be the next video and then i'll do a video where i'm making some beats out of this stuff so again that's just a quick run through of drum keys big white beats the wave 8 sample pack uh just running through what they sound like so thank you guys please hit like and subscribe and i'm glad to be back here on youtube it's been a long time and hope you're all staying safe and wearing your masks i'll see you later [Music] you", "DCFo25H5Avs": "our first drink is the paloma a grapefruit tequila drink from mexico the classic version of this drink involves tequila and grapefruit soda around one part to three parts squeeze in some lime juice and a pinch of salt then garnish with a lime the word paloma means dove in spanish and doves are notorious for making love atop rape grapefruit so i'm pretty sure that's how it gets its name if you want to make a less classic paloma you can take a grapefruit whoops you want to keep it whole because the small grapefruit packets are too sweet on their own you can tell these are farmed grapefruits the wild ones are a much deeper red color and they're not as big you can use a fork to get that juice out or a reamer which is good for reaming use a concave wire net to catch the seeds and pulp take two ounces of grapefruit juice add in two ounces of tequila squeeze in a wedge of lime put in a quarter ounce of simple syrup and club soda to taste and a pinch of salt to make simple syrup also known as watered-down sugar you take one part sugar to one part water melt it in a pot then allow it to cool to room temperature to make complicated syrup you take one part water to two parts sugar to 1 8 part water to 232 parts water to 1 16 parts water you can also make homeopathic simple syrup if you put one grain of sugar inside a swimming pool you could go with a salt rim if you don't put salt inside it and garnish with lime or a full grapefruit make sure you clean the grapefruit first in case there's dove love making residue on it and remember that paloma has the word pal in it which makes it a great cocktail to share with a friend but not with an enemy otherwise it would be called the enemaloma the whiskey sour was invented back in the days where you attracted a mate by puckering your lips pucker muscles were severely underdeveloped in those times so lemon helped many find their one true drunken love we'll start with two ounces of bourbon but pour it like you're not already drunk one ounce of lemon sour juice and half an ounce of simple syrup and then you have to decide if you want to add egg white point the egg white creates a creamy frothy texture that's rather enjoyable counterpoint i came here to drink not to have a whiskey omelette point but look how cool it looks and hear how great it tastes counterpoint i'm not interested in dying from salmonella point you're being dramatic and you haven't even had a drink yet if you decide to go with the egg white an easy way to de-occafy an egg is with a plastic bottle you just squeeze it out then let it open up and suck the yolk into the bottle elevator then we'll add in a quarter ounce of egg white and then we'll do what's known as a dry shake because there's no ice in it which is weird since all the ingredients are wet and ice is the only thing that would be dry since i don't have a shaker i'm using a mason jar which not only gets the job done with minimal glass shards it also makes this a single distilled mason cocktail now we'll throw in some ice and shake it until it's cold now pour that over a big ass ice cube you can also use a big-ass ice cube with a chunk of yellow pepper inside it and now i'll just give this a wang jangle with my super fancy drink stirring spoon for no reason since i already shook it that creamy frothy texture is pretty small so i probably should have used more egg white counterpoint you should have used no egg white now if you want to get really fancy you can take some smoke trap it inside a glass and then just leave it there because inhaling smoke is bad for you then garnish with an entire lemon if you're in a rush to find a relationship the bee's knees combines the antibacterial power of gin with the antibacterial power of honey making it the ultimate cleanse drink we're gonna take two ounces of jag juice in this case gin try to hit the glass when you pour that then we'll add three quarters of an ounce of lemon juice and a half ounce of honey syrup which is just like simple syrup except it's made with honey that's one part water to one part honey now we'll give this a shake oh wait i forgot i do have a shaker [Music] goodbye aunt winnie now if you're wondering why bartenders shake drinks and shakers for a ridiculous amount of time it's because bartenders love attention also it causes dilution which makes the booze less strong since you can't handle it straight if you have weak arm muscles but strong hip muscles you can always put the shaker in your belt and put on some techno the bee's knees is traditionally served in a coop or martini glass but i don't have and or don't like drinking out of those glasses so i made my own very good and very safe and we'll put that in the molecule slower downer to chill it then we'll garnish this with a man in the boat but do bees actually have knees yes they do they have a knee on each of their six legs they're around two trillion honeybees in the world that's 132 bees knees for every human knee on the planet so yeah there's bee's knees all right that bee's knees is the cat's pajamas and it'll get you right zazzled and so ossified it'll make any wet blanket spouting apple sauce seem hotsy totsy that's worth five clams it's better than noodle

minutes and then wipe it off okay it's pretty hard to mess this up but where it gets complicated is with all the different applicators and all the different sealers that are available so in this video I'm going to share everything you need to know about sealing grout so you can stop watching videos and stop researching and just get started already all right so first off why would you want to seal grout in the first place well basically to make it look nicer for longer if you don't seal grout anything that gets on it is going to absorb in so that could be oil from your skin that could be grease from some food that you cooked that could be bath and soap scum from taking a shower whatever splashes on that is gonna absorb into the grout because cement grout is actually porous so if you don't steal it it's gonna look bad it might even grow a mold and it might even start to stink okay so you really want to seal it's important however sealing your grout does not make it waterproof okay grout and tile is not meant to be a waterproof barrier it does shed most of the water but in a tile installation like this the waterproofing is actually behind the tile okay and if you're trying to fix a leaking shower wall by sealing the grout sorry to inform you of this but you can't just seal the grout to seal the shower you're probably gonna have to rip out the whole shower reinstall it the proper way and then maybe seal your grout then just to keep it looking better all right next up let's talk about what the best sealer to use is so there are a lot of different options available a lot of really good options a lot of options that probably aren't worth using but based on my research the best option is aqua mix sealers choice gold okay you can get this at Home Depot I believe you can get it online I'll even provide a link in the video description directly below this video it's manufactured by custom building products which is the same company that manufactures polyblend grout which is probably the type of grout that you have on your tile in the first place so this is our professional version of grout sealer it's been around for a really long time and it's what most contractors use you can also use it on natural stone and natural tile as well so if you're also sealing your stone or maybe even your granite countertops this will work okay this container right here cost me about 33 bucks okay I've had it for a long time I could probably seal this entire shower three or four times with just this container okay so it goes a pretty long way depending on how much grout you have and how thick your grout is of course okay so this is a really good option this is the one I recommend in most cases ok another option which is by the same exact company is called surface guard okay this is also a sealer that works on natural stone tile and grout okay it's made by custom building products as well it's a little bit less expensive it comes in the spray bottle if you plan on spraying it it's about $26 for this so not much less expensive than this so really the only reason I would use this if you just want the convenience spray bottle but other than that I would go with the better higher-end stuff now really you can use anything that has fluoro chemicals in it that's gonna actually penetrate into the tile and then it's going to absorb into all those pores and harden so nothing else can get inside of that okay so you want to use any kind of floral chemical sealer and there's a lot of them out there if you don't want to use this option now one thing to consider is certain sealers also have what's called enhancer with them okay they're a sealer and enhancer and usually those are used for when you're sealing like a granite countertop or maybe some terracotta tiles and you want them to have that wet look okay you want them to look wet all the time and really it's really gonna darken it and maybe even make it a little bit shiny okay these sealers aren't going to change the look of it at all maybe they will italia bit but not unnoticeably all right moving right let's talk about the different ways to apply sealer to the grout okay the first method is obviously just a spray bottle you just spray it all over the place give it get all over its gonna spray into the air it's gonna get on your body and your lungs and all that stuff and then you're just gonna go let it absorb in for a minute and then you're gonna wipe it off with a towel or paper towel or whatever you just wipe off the excess this is a really good method to use if you have natural stone that you're sealing with your grout okay you can you you can also put this in a spray bottle too comes in this container but you can put it in spray bottle and spray it the problem with that okay it's a little bit Messier it's gonna get on your paint it's gonna get on your shower fixtures it's gonna get on your bathtub it's gonna get on you you're more likely to breathe it in which is a health hazard and there's a lot of chemicals in here stuff that I definitely wouldn't want to breathe in so if you're gonna use this method I would recommend maybe taping off and keeping it from getting on other stuff and also opening a window with a fan and even using a respirator just to make sure you're not sacrificing your health just so you can have better looking grout because that's kind of stupid so that's a good option if you have a ton of space and you know you just need to do it really quick and get it done like that okay the second option is with one of these little applicators here which has a little brush on the top and you just put the sealer inside and then you can squeeze this and it'll actually shoot out and you just rub it along the grout lines with the sealer in it and it applies the sealer again you wipe off the excess so this is a really good method to use if you're sealing your floor tiles okay and you have those thicker grout lines because you can squeeze a lot of sealer out and you're not gonna waste a bunch of sealer just spraying it all over your floor tiles that's you know not even gonna absorb it okay so this is a really good option that I recommend for floor tiles then the third option that I'm actually going to use on this project is just one of these little foam brushes that I got from the paint department it's usually used for staining wood or something like that get a little plastic container put some sealer in there and then just apply it to the lines so I can apply it quickly and accurately and that's actually gonna be a little bit faster than this for this project okay because I have really small grout lines and I'm not gonna have to constantly be taking my brush if I really thick grout lines then I'd probably want to just use this because it would be a little faster okay either one of these is cheap you're gonna find it at most tile stores or I think I got these at Home Depot okay they're gonna work so there you have three methods for applying grout sealer all right so let's go ahead and get started with this demonstration I'm gonna seal this grout right here so this grout has actually already been sealed a year ago when it was originally installed and yesterday I cleaned it really well and now it's ready to seal so basically what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna dump a little bit of this sealers choice gold into this plastic container and then I can go ahead and apply it starting at the top and working down to the tile and just smooth strokes and you can tell that it's applying because it's just a little bit darker where it absorbs it okay and in some cases that might not even absorb much because they're still still in there from last year in some areas of the shower don't get don't see very much water so you're just gonna want to apply it to every single grout line on the entire job methodically now in most cases you're gonna want to do two coats so you're gonna do one wait about a half an hour and then apply a second coat of sealer to get the most protection and then you can actually test it after another half hour by putting a drop of water on it seeing if it absorbs into the grout and if it does then you're gonna want to apply more sealer if it doesn't then your grout is sealed and you're ready to go there's nothing else to do as you can see here I've actually taped off the bathtub because I just don't know what this these chemicals are gonna do to this acrylic bath tub and I don't want to risk it I don't necessarily know that it's gonna harm it but I don't want to take the risk so I'm gonna be extra here and take it off another thing you'll notice is that I have a fan in the window now I'm using that fan to draw air out of the room while I apply the sealer because the sealer does have VOCs and a bunch of other things that you should not inhale this is kind of a boring process which is probably why most contractors don't actually seal the grout when they leave they'll just install it sit and then let you know that you should probably seal the grout and not actually provide that service to themselves but the good news is with the right preparation and just a little bit of patience you can easily seal your grout yourself alright so let's talk about a few more tips and tricks floor ceiling your grout so first off when should you seal your grout and how often so basically you want to wait at least 48 hours after you grout your tile or it to cure completely make sure it's clean and then you can seal the grout ideally you wait 72 hours which is three days for those of you you don't want to do the math and then after that you're gonna want to seal it about once every year especially if you have a high use area like a shower for example okay seal it about once every year and it's pretty quick you just clean it off again really well and then seal it again another thing ought to mention is that not all grout actually needs to be sealed there's actually something called epoxy grout which is plastic based instead of cement based like most grouts are and that does not need to be sealed in fact it won't even accept a seal if you tried to okay so you can tell you have an epoxy grout if it kind of looks like plastic okay it looks real plastic e that's probably an epoxy grout you might be wondering why doesn't everybody use epoxy grout if it's so good you don't have to seal it well there are a couple of downsides number one it's a little bit more difficult to work with number two it's more expensive but number three sun will actually change the color over time okay so if you haven't a spot that gets a lot of sun shining on it it's gonna yellow over time and some people just don't want that look okay you're doing natural stone or something really the typical grout sanded grout or something like that a cement based product is actually going to look better another thing I want to mention is that you may in some cases also need to seal the tile itself so if you have a natural stone like terracotta or granite for example you're also gonna want to seal that once a year because those stones are also porous and if you don't seal them they can stain just like your grout can but with any glazed tile like porcelain or ceramic or anything like that okay you do not need to seal it in fact it won't even accept a seal if you try and my last tip okay is that if your sealer hardens on the tile before you wipe it off okay you make a mistake you forget to wipe something off and it's hardened on there you're trying to clean it off with water it's not working there's a really easy trick okay you just get your rag wet with more sealer wipe it back on there it's gonna reactivate the sealer that's stuck on your tiles and then you just wipe it off with a clean dry towel that's gonna absorb all that okay really simple so even if you mess it up there's an easy fix so this video was brought to you by handyman stardom com so what is an Eman

about a question that comes up quite a bit in the groups and that is weighing your wax trying to fill trying to figure out exactly how much wax and oil so that you can fill a container perfectly and not have leftover wax or not enough wax to go into it now this is one that I can't believe I haven't covered before it's come up in a lot of the groups that I've been in for the last couple years and the confusion comes from adding the wax and getting your oil percentage so basically let's use the basic ratio the 16 ounces we're gonna use 10% so if you're you're adding 10 percent to 16 ounces of wax you're basically doing 1.6 ounces of oil so if you're taking the 16 ounces of wax you're adding the 1.6 ounces of oil you're coming up with 17 points 6 ounces of total wax and oil together now that's not a problem if you're filling some of the 3 the 8 ounce jelly jars it's gonna fill three of those just perfect but the question comes up what happens if you wanted to fill a jar that that's exactly 16 ounces and that becomes a problem because you've got extra wax and oil that's of course not gonna go into that now you could of course just poor couple melts but a lot of people like to be exact and what ends up happening is a lot of people will get their measurements they'll weigh the 16 ounces of wax they'll get their percentage which is 10% 1 point 6 ounces and then they'll actually subtract 1 point 6 ounces of wax and then add the oil so that they come up with a grand total of 16 ounces now of course on the surface this seems just fine you're removing the wax you're adding the oil you're still coming up with 16 ounces but what happens is once you remove some of that wax you've already made calculations on that weight the 16 ounces and when you reduce that down to basically 14.4 your oil stays the same and you've essentially increased the oil percentage up to around eleven and a half percent this one gets glossed over it's real easy to just kind of gloss over and I think about this one I have definitely done this one and the reason I wanted to bring this up is because the discussion came up in the group the last week and Maria McDonald actually came back after discussing in one of the threads she actually came back with the formula to come up with the exact wax and weight ratio to basically fill a container so if you're 16-ounce or a 20 ounce or 30 ounce this is the formula to come up with exactly how much oil you will need for the wax that goes into it so we're gonna go ahead and cut right over I'm gonna get out the the chalkboard again because a lot of people like that one and just do like a quick overview and show the formula on that one all right this is a question that comes up quite a bit in the groups I've seen it around for a long time and it came up the other day and it was discussed in one thread and then it was brought back up and made very clear in another thread by Maria MacDonald so I kind of wanted to go over that with this one because one of the formulas that she posted in there was really good and I wanted to highlight exactly that so most of the time when you're doing your waxes and you're coming up with your weights let's call it 16 ounces because that's typically what everybody goes by 16 ounces of wax and if you want to get 10% oil of course you're gonna do times 0.1 which is 1.6 ounces of oil what you're going to do is you're going to add that 1.6 ounces to the 16 so you're gonna get a grand total a seventeen point six ounces of wax and oil and then of course if you're pouring that into like the the 8 ounce jelly jars you're gonna get three of those but the point has been made but what happens if you want to fill a container that is exactly 6 ounces or 16 ounces what do you do now I've seen this come up a lot what they'll do is they'll take their container which is 16 ounces they'll take their oil which is one point six ten ten ounces and they'll subtract the one point six from the 16 ounces which comes up to fourteen point four ounces of wax and then they'll add the one point six ounces of oil which of course equals sixteen ounces total now I've seen a lot of people do it this way and this is definitely not the right way to do this and the reason why is once you take basically you made your calculation off of 16 ounces of wax which is one point six ounces so when you go ahead and remove the wax you've made enough room to add your oil but what you've also done is if you've also increased your percentage so fourteen point four times ten percent is actually one point four ounces so what we've done is you've basically up your oil percentage and what you're adding isn't ten percent anymore it's actually more like eleven and a half percent now depending on the wax that may not be a big deal but if you're going for a certain percentage like a nine or like a nine percent this is definitely gonna come off it's gonna be very wrong quite kitty now for me when I've done this before I've always taken the container which is sixteen ounces and I've just subtracted two ounces because I knew the oil was going to be around like 1 to 1.5 which is just under 16 ounces we're looking at like we're looking at like just under 16 ounces fifteen point nine five and for me that's always been just fine I've never really cared too much to get exact but Maria McDonald actually came up with the formula or posted the formula which is actually why I wanted to do this video because it was a very good formula which will calculate exactly how much oil you need in your wax to fill a certain ounce container so if we're calling that one 16 ounces so instead of the other one where you multiplied by point one zero which is 10% so with the other formula you're doing 16 times point one zero which is 10 percent so with this one we're going to go ahead and we're going to add a 1 so it's one point one and we're going to divide instead of multiply so you're going to do 16 divided by 1.1 which is actually 14 point five four and then if you take the fourteen point five four times point 10% you actually get one point four five which is exactly 16 so that's gonna be the best formula to figure out exactly what you need to do for a 16 ounce container or 32 or whatever container you're putting it into and of course that works if you want to go up to 12% or drop it down to 8% so 1.7 four ounces of oil which comes out to exactly 16 ounces once again so let's go ahead and try that with a 20 ounce jar so if we wanted to fill this it was exactly 20 ounces worth so if we want to fill the 20 ounce container we're gonna take 20 divide it by 1.1 which will be our 10% and we're gonna get 18 point 1 and then of course if we want to get our 10% oil I amount out of that we're gonna multiply by 0.1 zero which comes out to 1.8 which is just under 19 obviously these go out a little further I didn't add those in there but it comes out to roughly 20 ounces all right so that's pretty much it I hope that one I hope I didn't gloss over anything I got to rewatch this video I was trying to keep everything together and kind of calculate everything to make sure I was coming up with all the right calculations with a calculator and on the chalkboard at the same time so I think I got everything covered pretty well in the the chalkboard demonstration and I won't know until I watch this back but that's pretty much it right there the formula is going to be you're gonna divide by the percentage that you want which is going to be 110 112 and then you're gonna break that down to one point one one point one two if you're doing 8% you're gonna do one point zero eight nine percent one point zero nine and you're actually going to come out with the exact amount of wax that you need to remove from 16 ounces or 20 ounces or whatever the container size is so that you can get the correct amount of oil in there now if you're doing something like 8 or 9 percent in the wax holds up to 12% this isn't a huge deal if you end up with more oil like if you actually did the 16 ounces weighed your oil and then you remove the wax and still had it you would bump up from 8 percent to like 9 percent or 9 and a half percent it's not gonna be a big deal because that wax can hold that but if you're doing a wax that has something like 12% and you actually add the 12% oil and then reduce it you're basically gonna up that to around 13 or 14% which could affect the candle and you could get a lot more seepage you could get a sweating and beating at the top of the candle so it's definitely something that you want to pay attention to and of course for those people who are getting down to exact measurements they know exactly what their candle holds and what they put in each of their candles this is definitely a formula that you want to pay attention to so huge thank you to Maria McDonald who posted the formula in the group I've always done it crazy ways and I've never even looked up the formula so it huge thanks to her for posting that in there the feedback on the last chalkboard video is really positive so I wanted to get a couple more of these out if you have something that you'd like to see a little bit more or basically something that goes into a little bit more detail like this please let me know in the comments down below and we'll try to add that to an upcoming video and again if I glossed over anything in the video or if something wasn't clear enough and I think I got everything but I haven't watched this part back yet so I want to go through and make sure that I covered everything if I didn't I'm gonna go ahead and throw some of the formulas up in the video so that you can see them but if I did gloss over something or you want something in more detail please let me know again in the comments down below and I'll try to go through answer every single one of them and I hopefully put it in another video and of course you can follow me on all the social media

step first of all what operations should use to solve the problem well when it says we mixed one and 4/5 ounces of blue paint with two and 1/10 how many ounces of painted Denise mix well since we've got two different ones and it just wants to know how many ounces we know that we should use edition because it's come asking us to combine or all together how many ounces and we know that all together does mean to use addition so let's look at the next one do the fractions have the same denominator well we've got one and 4/5 and we have 1/10 they do not have the same denominator so no they do not so to find the sum of mixed numbers with unlike denominators you can use a common denominator we're basically going to do the exact same way that we have been doing so the first thing we're going to do is estimate the sum well we've got 1 and 2/5 and we've got 2 and 1/10 and 1 into fist would actually round to because remember our benchmarks 1 I'm sorry one in 4/5 I said cheapest one in for fence would actually round since we're only one piece away from the hoe it would round to 2 and since we've only got one piece out of the ten ms/ms we would round to our benchmark of the whole numbers so it would be two plus two equals four would be our estimate so let's look at step two it says to find a common denominator use the common denominator to write equivalent fractions with like denominators so the first thing we need to do is we need to find a common denominator between 10 and 5 and so in order to do that we need to list our multiples of 5 and 10 so let's do that to begin with 5 10 15 20 and then let's look at our 10 10 20 30 and we can already stop because we see the least common denominator between the two is the 10 so the we can use the denominator of 10 and the denominator of 10 so we do that our denominator stays the same over here our fraction stays the same over there and then we know that in order to get from 5 x 2 equals 10 whatever we do to the denominator we have to do to the numerator so 4 times 2 equals 8 so then we have 1 and 8/10 and 2 and 1/10 so if we add these together it's what 8 plus 1 is 9 tits and 1 plus 2 is 3 and what you'll see that we just did we added the fractions and then added the whole numbers and write the answer in simplest form and that is going to be the simplest we can do it so Denise mixed 3 & 9 10 ounces of hate now let's look at our questions down below explain how you know whether your answer is reasonable well now let's take a look at another example except this time we're actually going to be subtracting mixed numbers so our fraction is or a mixed number is four and five six minus two and three fourths so it says you can also use a common denominator to find the difference difference is the answer to a subtraction problem of mixed numbers with unlike denominators so the step one is to estimate the difference and since we're looking at the fraction 5/6 we see that we have five out of the six parts present so we're only missing one part so we know that we can round four and five six to five now when we look at our next mixed number we see we also have a fraction of three-fourths which means that we have three out of the four pieces present which means that we're only missing one so when we look at that one in round we can round to three and we know that five minus three equals two so our next step says to find a common denominator use the common denominator to write equivalent fractions with like denominators so in order to find our common denominator we have to list our multiples of six and four so let's begin with 6 12 18 24 and 30 then we look at 4 8 12 and we noticed we can already stop because we have a common denominator multiple of 12 so we can use 12 as our denominator for both fractions now to find our equivalent fractions we know that we have to multiply 4 times 3 to equal 12 and whatever we do in the denominator we have to do with the numerator so 3 times 3 equals 9 now let's look at the top fraction we know that we multiply 6 times 2 to equal 12 whatever we do with the denominator we also have to do with the numerator so 5 times 2 equals Ted so now we have equivalent fractions of ten twelve and nine twelve so our next step says to subtract the fractions so we know that 10 minus 9 equals 1 our denominator does not change since we're subtracting fractions and then it says subtract the whole numbers and we're going to write the answer in simplest form and our whole numbers were 4 minus 2 and that would be 2 and 1/12 now it says to explain how you know whether your answer is reasonable well we know that our answer is reasonable because when we look at our estimated number of two our estimate equals two and our answer to and 112 is very close to two so we know that our answer is reasonable okay so now so now let's go ahead and pull out your math journals and let's begin taking our notes for today's lesson adding and subtracting mixed numbers remember that you can push pause at this moment so that you can get all the notes copied down all right let's take a look at our password for tonight's lesson it says Sarah place three and five eighths quarts of strawberries and two and 1/8 quarts of strawberries of blueberries and a bowl how many quarts of fruit did Sarah place in the bowl is it one and four eight quarts five and 5/16 quartz five and six eight quarts or five and seven eighths course make sure you record your answer in your journal and bring it with you to class on Monday see you then thank you", "Mh9kv1FE_OA": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to our channel so today's video is going to be us cooking one of his favorite um dinner recipes [Applause] that he got from my mother and that that's actually my mom's recipe so um we're gonna make that today and that looks like a hobo i'm gonna be looking like a hobo until i give birth so just don't mind my outfits because nothing fits and yeah so we're gonna make a chicken and rice dinner that we make quite often and i'm going to show you one of my favorite trail mix that i like to eat this time of year too so yeah so the first first thing you're going to do is cook the rice that's the very first thing you're gonna do so i like to do 12 servings of rice because we love rice i'm going to do 12 servings of rice so i'm gonna need three cups of rice i'm gonna i'll be right back i gotta take my hoodie off and [Music] all right so that's basically the rest of this box [Music] yeah and then six cups of water you can use the instant rice too but i prefer this the bag dries pretty much you guys just throw it in there huh it's like bagged rice because some people they burn rice so yeah but you can use whatever rice you want but i prefer this one tastes better then you want to spray you want to get one of these pans and that you want to spray that while we're waiting for the rice to cook i'm going to show you how to make this halloween or fall trail mix so what you're gonna need is you can probably do this completely different you can add in your own you can add your own peanuts you can add you can have whatever kind of nest you want whatever kind of candy you want whatever you want but i do this mixture because i think it tastes the best that coffee knocks it well what you're gonna need what i have is a whole can of cocktail peanuts i'm gonna take this one first oh this does not smell good right now and you're gonna pour this and then you're gonna want to get some [Applause] [Music] cashews this jar i would use one can like the same size as that or smaller of cashews but i only have this big thing so i'm gonna use half of it then you're gonna take your spoon out and stir that [Music] and then you're gonna want to take some right now so i'm gonna put some pumpkin seeds in here too i would just normally do the cashews and the peanuts but because i'm trying to eat a lot of nuts i'm gonna add some pizzas too this is more of a healthy trail mix you can also go with m m's peanut m yeah i would add m ms too but i don't have anything right now yeah you can add any candy you want butterfingers all kinds of weird stuff whatever your taste buds go i'm saving the best candy [Applause] no i i like cashews and peanuts but when you mix there's not enough sweet in there not for me okay can you give me a second yeah let me see if i have anything because all i see is candy corn all right folks oh yeah you could you could add other stuff because like if you just do one sweet and all this stuff if you have a sweet tooth like me you do not have a blanket she doesn't have a sweet tooth and then i'm gonna the last nut i'm gonna add is some sunflower seeds these are my favorite i'd love to have flowers these i'm gonna add a plunge i have one too are you trying to like become a plant or something like i love peanuts my family is a huge peanut like they always have nuts in their house and i just grew up eating nuts and my dad would probably like this but just not me my dad would like this really he loves nuts but that's not good for you they're whatever and then that's so good and then you're gonna add in your can't make yours and then you're gonna add in a candy corn and then normally that would be it but for my cow's sake i'm gonna add some greasy but you want to keep the cute little shave so i'm gonna keep it full just make sure you keep them cool or else they're gonna melt into your trail mix and you're gonna have like this weird texture in your trail mix and no one wants weird weird is weird oh yeah it's melting this is the traveling trail mix that i make so when your rice is done you're gonna take a big bowl i can't say on my eyes i have onions on the bottom [Music] yeah i make this like every two weeks like this it's one of my favorites and then you're gonna take about three fourths cup of top onion i don't measure anything i just throw everything in there but if you want to make things easier you can get the frozen one and then usually three-fourths is usually like half a bag and we usually just keep it because likely said she makes it so much so and i don't like the taste of fresh onions right now they make me gag but i can't really taste these so that's why you want more i also just put the whole thing in there yeah so like i said we'll put the recipe down there um now we can follow the exact measurements but i just kind of like it's one of those things now that we just made so much that it's just like we know what to do so we're just not gonna do you can also add in celery but we don't like celery huh i was like celery sounds nasty we don't like fruits and we don't i mean we don't like vegetables in our dish we eat it on the side so it calls for celery and carrots but we don't add that in there and then you're gonna need butter try to mix it well so you don't have the onions all clumped up is that both correct uh well yeah i think this is plastic so this is a plus maybe it's a hard cold i should use that for the trail mix and this one for them yeah it's fine all you're doing is mixing your eyes and then you're going to use two tablespoons of butter so i just do two big spoonfuls and one two [Applause] and you just mix it all good until the melting pot and then you also are going to add in parsley flakes but i don't have that so i use oregano and it calls for two teaspoons but i'm just gonna do this i tried making this once by myself if you don't know how to like stay organized or clean you will make a mess in the kitchen because when elise wants to go visit her family i made this by myself he said it took forever it took me like an hour to make this because like i made a mess everywhere to clean it was just he was bad because he made it and then he has how much to clean up [Music] somebody had to wait an hour so it's easier for you to clean as you go instead of just all doing it so like when the rice is cooking i suggest you clean or else you're going to feel it i normally do that when the rice is done you clean the pots and pans and the bowl and everything else you want to add salt and pepper in there sure so then you're going to add salt and pepper you're going to add 1 4 teaspoon of salt and 1 8 teaspoon of pepper like i said you can follow the recipe you just make so much we're just like uh i shouldn't be reading mine y'all cookie makes me sweat it's hot today and then once you have all that mixed in you're gonna pour it in your dish so it goes on the bottom it's not bad it's just not supposed to have this much in it yeah it's not made for this kind of um that's so good [Music] clean that rice up [Applause] the rice really compliments the chicken thighs hey spread it out evenly i got it and then you're gonna take your chicken you can use any kind of chicken i have to use um chicken tenderloin yeah i'd use chicken tenderloin one time because [Applause] you can use whatever chicken you want but i think chicken thighs is the best one to have for it yeah i get to bone less one no you can't get the bone once it's really irritating when you eat it because like while you're cooking you know because like once you put the sauce on top you know what i'm talking about it's kind of hard to see the chicken depending on yourself we use two packs it calls for one pack but michael likes a lot of meat so yeah it's better with more because you know there's a lot of rice in here and then you'd be like oh yeah i don't want that much and then you end up eating way more than you think you were well you guys i'm pregnancy right you're supposed to preheat your oven before you do all this it's a 350. you're going to make the sauce so you're going to need the best thing ever cream of mushroom don't forget it because if you don't if you do forget it and you try to put it in it's not going to taste the same and it's not going to be moist and that's what matters moist everyone say it with me moist it caused you didn't say moist what you're gonna say moist moist no you gotta be moist moist good so you need the smaller can but they never have those anymore at the commissary so we got the big one so you're just going to use if you get the big one you're going to use half of this which is 1 10 3 4 ounce of what one slash 10 three-fourths what how do you think what are you talking about yeah so like 10 ounces and three fours pretty much so if not it'll be in the description like you said she's having a first whole can of the smaller one most times you will never find it you usually have to use a big can anyways the more the merrier right use half of it what did it say when i made this dinner um he don't think he never tried it he said something though something that was in it and he was like questioning it oh i don't know probably the mushroom or the mayo and then you're gonna need two-thirds cup of ranch but like i said i don't measure that so two-thirds cup of mini so and then i need the milk [Music] so we use hidden uh valley for the ranch because i always tell people that ranch france always tastes different no matter like which one you get so just so you know what we use when you put the valley branch just the original so i don't want anyone to be like well this tastes disgusting well maybe it's probably because of the ranch or the meal yeah we also use craft mail yeah so just letting you guys know and then we use regular mouse we don't use almond milk or cashew milk and then you need fourth cup of milk yeah that's about right i guess so this is the consistency so if you don't know you know so consistency you know yeah so it's not like a soupy but it's still a little bit thick so it tastes really good once this cook don't try it straight up just want to let you know cause the thickness does matter because you don't want soupy soupy sauce soup sauce and just so you know we put the um so we lay the chicken just like this chicken goes on top rice goes on bottom everything's already been pre-seasoned our thing is clear we usually try to get a clear pan so we know uh we always use our clear pan fruits just so we can't know that the rice is like done because you got to put the rice in there as well so also this is the only pan i have so okay just concentrate everything i said huh huh i'm here and you're gonna pour it over the chicken now a lot of people are like whoa whoa it's using the chicken so the cream of mushroom and the ranch and the mayo and since we season the rice it's really everything goes together it mixes together and also we will season the top of it once we cook it for a certain amount of time so once you have your i normally coat the whole chambering the whole chicken with sauce i actually made a little bit more sauce this time just because we have more meat and more yeah a little bit more so you put it in there for 45 minutes and then you take it out and you put the paprika on there and it's not spicy i say this again not spicy don't put spicy paprika because it makes it spicy because some people don't like spicy and then it ruins the whole dish for you you cook this in for 45 minutes then you put the paprika on top and then you put this back in the oven at 350 still for 15 minutes and you don't cover it you leave it uncovered and it cooks for a total of an hour yeah we're not here to waste their time they don't they don't want to see our face all day i'm just saying it smells like hay they don't care i miss lehigh i'm sorry that's good i apologize for her i can smell the whole day but anyways we'll see you after um i guess the 45 minutes and then yeah we'll go from there remember when he said he should clean in between he's such a liar he's such a liar i have to clean it he never cleans it iphone chairs i don't give a set yeah so it makes it easier for you guys just um yes you just usually pull it out hopefully you have an oven i can do that so and then you'll just sprinkle your paprika all over the cow come on dude is she on a picnic again assuming it's cool okay stay on topic i love that pigment but it's hard to put potty but they're just pretty much like putting on everything if you overdo it don't be like scared too because it's gonna be all over the chicken once you mix it up so i like to put it in for 20 minutes just because well there's more chicken this time excuse me i'm still burping from that coffee because there's more chicken in there this time and last time i was paranoid that it wasn't cooked all the way so we're gonna do 20 minutes and instead of 15. this is what it should look like um yeah it's pretty self-explanatory you know they get the chicken thighs on top and then you put your paprika everything's cooked and then we're gonna have to pour on a thigh or vegetable and yeah it's pretty easy dinner it just takes a really long time because roughly i would say like hour 45 minutes with prep and cooking and then if you know for me and elise for lisa lisa i always use the meat thermometers just because i want to make sure that the chicken's cooked properly because she's pregnant if uh if you do have someone that needs the meat to be cooked like a certain way i highly suggest it um if you know it's done it's 165 just so you know just for your own knowledge and stuff like that so yeah but yeah that's pretty much it we uh cooked chicken thighs and made uh our what you made your halloween trail halloween trail mix so that concludes this video in the next video you can uh you can see elisa show off some of her stuff she's going to be starting a business an online business so in the next video she'll be talking about that yeah so subscribe down below like this video she doesn't like she doesn't like to spoil people but i like to give you little guys a little bit of stuff so thanks for watching see you in the next one [Music] you", "nauLgZISozs": "What would you do with a brain\nif you had one?

made it in this pan that was sent to me as a gift from a viewer diane thank you diane [Music] hey y'all it's tammy with collard valley cooks today our oven's preheated for 350 degrees and we're going to make an old special the earthquake cake some people call it upside down german chocolate cake and some people call it earthquake cake it is going to be so delicious it is coconut pecans german chocolate cake mix with cream cheese butter and powdered sugar dolloped on the top so delicious i've got a measuring cup that i'm gonna put my oil in you're just gonna go by the directions on the box for your cake mix so we need a half cup of cooking oil now we've already got one quarter cups of water in here and three eggs next to me we're going to be mixing up just a typical cake mix for one of the layers of this cake so when i do a cake mix i typically start out what no matter how i'm mixing it up by hand or with the mixer i typically start out with all the wet ingredients in first so we're going to add the one and a quarter cups of water a quarter cup of oil and three eggs all right it's time to add the eggs you're going to use three eggs all right we'll go ahead and mix this a little bit and then we'll add our cake mix i am using a german chocolate super moist cake mix we'll pour it in it's an easy recipe too now we're going to make we're going to rinse these beaters off because we've got to beat up some cream cheese and butter i'm going to go over here and rinse the beaters off and get us another bowl we're going to put these back on the mixer all right we're going to put in 8 ounces of cream cheese i just heard the ups man he has delivered the volume 3 cookbooks we've been waiting on them for 2 weeks it's very exciting so after i get this cake mixed up i'll start packaging orders for cookbooks this is a stick of butter which is a half cup of butter so you got eight ounces of cream cheese and a half cup of butter i'm good we're going to add a pound of powdered sugar a little at a time i'll go ahead and put in a little and this beater does not have a low to low speed so it's probably going to make a mess to me this is already sweet enough i personally don't want the cream cheese to be super sweet because then it takes away from the taste of the cream cheese it's plenty sweet and i put in about two cups of powdered sugar so that's what my recipe will call for so now to the fun part putting it together so once you've got everything mixed up clean up your station and we're going to layer the cake so really i only use about a half pound of the powdered sugar when i wrap my stuff up i use rubber bands i love using rubber bands if you've never done it it's real convenient and um i think i've got a little cream cheese on this bag i gotta wipe it off but it's really nice to use rubber bands and put things in the pantry with them they cost rip they're really cheap and they work much better than a chip clip or something like that and then you don't have to waste your gallon bags in your storage bags you can just wrap it up like that matter of fact got my coconut wrapped up like that right now get you a 9 by 13 cake pan that's a quarter sheet pretty much make sure you do a good job because this is a very sticky cake now we're going to take a cup of coconut and sprinkle it in the bottom and i'm not measuring i'm just going to sprinkle coconut in the bottom of my pan i love baker's coconut i don't know if you can get it where you live but it is so much moister than everybody else is it's amazing the difference for something like this it don't matter as much but if you're making a coconut cake um i would prefer having the moist coconut on my cake now we're going to put pecans in the bottom and i'm going to do the same thing and i'm just going to sprinkle them onto the bottom of the pan and i've got chocolates right here and um you use your judgment on how many you want to use they're expensive so if you don't want to use a ton of them don't but i'm probably going to use at least a cup to a cup and a half this cake can be frozen since it's just me and chris here i don't know that i want to eat this whole cake he's going to love it he loves anything german chocolate all right so there's the bottom now we're going to pour our batter in just spread it out even as you can and now we're just going to dollop our cream cheese mixture on the cake [Music] so all right now you don't have to swirl it but i'm going to just a little bit [Music] there's a lot on this end over here all right this is going in the oven at 350 degrees for one whole hour [Music] do [Music] you can see coconut sub one a little bit it looks like it's cratered all right see all those craters that's why it's called an earthquake cake got our milk yummy christmas broad milk because we were out and i'm going to cut a piece now this has cooled off completely i've never dumped one upside down just to see what it looks like but we're just going to cut a piece out of this put it on our plate and i'll show you how it looks sure get around the bottom good and it may take two pieces before i get a really nice before i can lift and i know it's lifting out pretty good lifting out pretty good looks delicious don't it let's take a bite chris loves german chocolate i usually make the homemade kind but every once in a while it's good to do something fun i think my sister-in-law makes this at christmas time i'm pretty sure she does it's delicious it's delicious y'all and it does taste like german chocolate let me say this that is so good there's nothing wrong with it instead of buying german chocolate icing out of a can make sure you make this cake next time if you don't want to do the homemade kind because it is delicious it tastes just like german chocolate [Music] thanks for watching collard valley cooks where we cook like mama did bye y'all love ya [Music] you", "3alDNC-DNBI": "hello everyone I'm Jeff Stanley was Stanley handcrafted and today we're gonna be talking about wax and weighing it and basically getting it into jars a question that comes up a lot and it's one that popped up again that Shawn and I were talking about the other day and that is when you're filling the candles and a lot of the tutorials that I do I use the 8 ounce jelly jar which is a really common jar and then of course pretty much any of the waxes we're using kind of one pound as the base for everything for the oil is just the mixing the weighing and pouring into different jars and the question that comes up a lot is the one pound of wax fits into three of the eight ounce of jelly jars which is this one right here and of course everybody's first question is how does 16 ounces fit into 3 8 ounce jars that would be 24 ounces and that's what this video is gonna be right here we're gonna go into exactly why 16 ounces of wax is gonna fill 3 of these jars now first off you're gonna see that the jar isn't actually full all the way so eight ounces would be clear to the top so if you did have three jars full completely to the top you're looking at right around like 24 ounces so we're actually going down just a little bit more so you're only putting I don't know I'd probably say like eighty-five ninety percent of the of the jars being full so you're gonna knock that down just a little bit more but that still doesn't take into take into the fact that you're only adding 16 ounces of wax but a lot of people forget that you're also adding a little bit of oil which kind of bumps that up a little bit so you're gonna be using 16 ounces of wax and then with the Paris Oi you're gonna be using right around 1.2 to 1.3 ounces of oil which is gonna bump that up to about 17 point two 17.3 but again that still doesn't add up to around kind of 20 21 22 ounces to fill those three jars and that's when we get into another area that a lot of people don't think about and something else that I kind of wanted to talk about too and that's because the wax actually has more volume than say something like water so a lot of people when they get into candles they don't know how much it lacks to add to a particular jar so a lot of people recommend adding water to a jar and basically seeing how much you need so basically a lot of people will get in and they'll fill this jars who right about this point they'll see the exact ounces that they need for water they'll take into a little bit of consideration for the oil that's going to go into it maybe get down a little bit and then of course when you weigh out that much wax and then you pour it into these you end up with a lot more wax than you thought of you end up with a lot more wax than you actually calculate it for and that's because wax is larger by volume than water is and what I mean by that is 16 ounces of water if you measure that into a measuring cup it's going to hit the 16 ounce mark if you measure 16 ounces of weighed wax and then you melt it down and then you pour that into the same measuring cup you're actually going to get a lot more than the 16 ounce line with the water so we're gonna go ahead and just jump right into the video I've already melted some and I'm just gonna show you the video of basically doing the water weighing it out showing it in the measuring cup and then weighing the wax melting it and then pouring it back into the measuring cup all right so we've got 16 ounces of wax solid form we're gonna go ahead and melt that down to see what it looks like in liquid form once you pour it into this to see the difference between 16 weighed ounces and 16 volume ounces and while we're waiting for that I've got some water right here so we're gonna go ahead and weigh out 16 ounces [Music] that's around 16.4 so just a little bit over but you can see that it's right at the 16 ounce mark it's actually just under a little bit so it aboard it exactly 16 ounces and then we're gonna go do the same thing with the wax all right so this is fully melted and this is 16 ounces exactly from what we made earlier I'm going to zero this out and then we're just going to go ahead and pour this in [Music] and you can see exactly what I was going for 15.8 there's too still a little bit of wax in there I'll try to get it back to 16 that's good enough but the point is that is why you measure by weight not volume so you can see the water of course it was sixteen point four and it was right at the 16 mark the wax at fifteen point nine is almost at twenty fluid ounces so that's the big reason why you always so that right there is exactly why you're always gonna measure and test in your glasses okay so you can clearly see that the wax there there is a lot more wax than there is water and that's where a lot of people get into trouble they do a lot of these jars they'll fill them up and when they go to do like six jars or something like that if you're weighing out like two pounds you end up with almost almost another full jar with wax that's left over that you didn't calculate for so that's why measuring with water is not a great idea it's always best to start with 1 pound of wax melt it down and then just pour it into jars and if you're under or over you can kind of you can adjust for that you can add an extra jar add a little bit more wax if you do have a little bit of extra wax I usually just pour it into a melt like these right here if I have extra wax especially when I'm doing the first couple batches and I'm trying to measure out how much wax is gonna go into like two or three of the nine ounce straight jars the tumblers or anything like that I know to start with a pound and I'll see how many jars I get out of that in anything left over I just pour straight into melts and then turn around and sell these but that still leaves the other question that a lot of people have and that is how does 16 ounces of wax and of course bumping it up with the oil and everything like that seventeen point three ounces of total wax weight and oil weight fit into three jars and basically that's going to come down to this so you're looking at a total of around seventeen point to seventeen point three if you divide that by three jars which it fits into you're gonna come out to just under six ounces so you're actually putting about six ounces of wax and oil into each jar so you're not actually getting a full eight ounces in the eight ounce jelly jar and then of course the reason that looks so full is because again you saw in the video that the wax there's a lot more volume than there is the water by weight so you saw that there's 20 ounces of basically volume so if you're gonna go by volume of wax it went up to the 20 ounce line so getting that much more wax it's gonna even though it weighs less you're gonna fill more of the jar so if you were to fill 6 ounces of water in this thing it would be a lot less than this so that's where a lot of people get into trouble with this one and I definitely did it in the beginning I just didn't even think about wax and water weighing the same or having the same volume and I made the same mistake I would basically go through I measured a couple jars and then of course I ended up with so much extra wax that I just couldn't figure it out and then of course like thinking about it a little bit actually going back to like high school science it finally made sense on why it did that so like I said getting into new jars anything like that and how do you weigh them out how do you figure out the wax I just go for a pound you can you can you can get away with a few other ways to do it too if you have like a 12 ounce jar you know it's not gonna hold 12 ounces so I usually go back down to right around like 80% wax so if it's 12 ounce jar I'll take it down to nine ten ounces somewhere in there and then I'll weigh that out add the oil and then I'll fill a couple different jars basically take like 12 ounce tumbler 10 ounces of wax and then I'll kind of double that up so I can kind of match it so if I'm doing three jars it'd be 30 ounces so that's like right at 2 pounds basically so I would just go ahead and add two ounces of wax fill those up kind of see where they go and see how much wax I have leftover or see how much wax I need and then I can adjust that 32 ounces up or down like one or two maybe three ounces depending on what I'm doing so if if those twelve ounce tumblers ended up only taking about nine ounces of wax I would take that back down from the 32 knock it back to around like twenty-eight twenty-nine ounces or bump it up to maybe 33 or 34 and the reason you would probably take it down a little bit more the 10 ounces I think the 12 ounce tumblers it's been a while since I've filled those I think they actually take a little bit closer to nine ounces of wax and then of course when you add the oil that's gonna bump it up a little bit more to around the 10 ounce mark but that would basically be my recommendation I usually just start out with 1 pound pour it see what it does and then if you've got extra you're gonna have a couple extra melts or just go by about 80% of the actual jar itself so again like I said a 12 ounce I would knock it down to around 9 or 10 if you're feeling like a 20 ounce jar or a bigger candle I would knock that one down probably 16 to 17 I don't know if I would go 18 on that one just because you're gonna have so much more wax that's probably gonna fill it so I would knock that one down a little bit more so probably 16 ounces in a 20 ounce container and then of course adjust as needed so I hope that made sense to a lot of people we get this question a lot and I have surprised I haven't done a video about this one in all this time it's a real easy one it's an easy one to mess up and it's one that a lot of beginners mess up every single time I did it in the beginning and somebody knew watching this video is probably still gonna do it so again if you have

and the tumbler the water does come out dark again but now almost are really nice and shiny all right", "B16JwwwSOLI": "today I'm going to show you the latest innovation and carwash technology everybody's always looking for a faster and easier way to wash their car motorcycle truck and our V so chemicalized we developed the best solution for that and that's EcoSmart the complete waterless detailing system now EcoSmart is designed to remove dirt debris water spots and bird droppings from your paint and reveal a fresh clean surface it's also designed to wash your car on a weekly basis using natural carnauba wax and kai-lan clay to clean and protect the surface works on all exterior surfaces works on paint glass metal chrome even aluminum it's a great product designed to clean any type of vehicle anywhere any time so we're gonna go ahead and clean this white Tesla sports car to make sure that it's free of any dirt debris and contamination it hasn't been washed in over a month so it's gonna be a perfect testbed to show how great the EcoSmart works on this beautiful metallic white paintwork now we already cleaned half of the Tesla and you can already see that the white paint work begins to shine after the EcoSmart removes all the heavy dirt and debris from the surface so you see the difference on this car let's show you guys how well the EcoSmart can really work so to use EcoSmart you either choose either a concentrated or ready to use version so to get started with the EcoSmart you need to go ahead and choose your solution EcoSmart comes in and ready to use and concentrated solution this is the ready to use you can grab it right out of the bottle and start cleaning your car or you can grab the concentrator which turns one gallon into ten gallons for the best value we're gonna going to use this ready to use solution right on this Tesla how'd I get started with the Eco smart you want to go ahead and give it a good shake when you give it a good shake it's gonna mix up the Chi long play and activate the natural carnauba wax it's gonna protect your vehicle and clean the surface so now that's shaken up and a bright green color we're ready to get started now you notice this Tesla is very dirty it has lots of dirt water spots mud fingerprints and even tree sap all over the front of this car everything that your car will experience after a month of not being washed so first we're gonna take the EcoSmart we're gonna saturate the surface I'm gonna give a nice light coating over the surface to pull up any dirt debris and help remove the water spots and set now once the surface is sprayed you'll notice that the color of the EcoSmart has gone from a green to a brown color that's because the EcoSmart surrounding the dirt lifting it from the surface and then it's gonna allow you to remove it using a premium microfiber towel so I grabbed one of our premium 16 by 16 workhorse microfiber towels these are a great accessory to use on the Tesla we use an eco-friendly detailing product with eco friendly green towels on this amazingly eco friendly all-electric Tesla sports car so I want to take my 16 by 16 microfiber towel fold in the forest and I'm gonna gently wipe in one direction as I wipe I'm pulling up any dirt debris contamination all that nasty stuff from the surface if you experience tree sap or airplane fuel any heavy contamination in the area you can go ahead and pre soaked your microfiber towel and gently work the area a little bit more to pull off the contamination but the Eco smarts designed to pull off heavy contamination so if you have to put a little bit effort into an area it's gonna be just fine to expose that beautiful surface so let's keep moving along the vehicle bar make sure you wipe in one direction only because the Eco smarts designed to protect the surface and not cause any scratches your vehicle is a little bit extra dirtier you can always go ahead and add a little bit more eco smart to help the surface go along with the cleaning process there we go EcoSmart is great because it works in everywhere you have a condo or an apartment that has water restrictions or you live in an area that limits the amount of water you can use at your home you can easily clean it using the Eco smart now you'll notice on the surface now as its hazed this haze is actually natural carnauba wax it's gonna bond to the surface and protect it to remove the carnuba wax we're gonna grab another 16 by 16 dry microfiber towel and we're gonna buff off any streaks you'll notice once I buff off the streaks and expose a nice beautiful surface this test was daily driven he lives in Los Angeles and it's exposed to overspray contamination all types of dirt and debris now our beautiful white paint works begin to shine through and you can see just these two sides how well the EcoSmart works with all this dirt in the middle it really makes a great difference on any color car it doesn't just work on pane it works on metal works on wheels also works on plastic so I'm gonna go ahead and refold my microfiber towel and I'm gonna go ahead and clean the headlights well spray a few sprays on the headlight I'll take a microfiber towel and I'll go ahead and gently clean off any dirt and debris then I'll go ahead and read Raab my dry microfiber towel and buff off any streaks and you'll notice that the headlight is beautifully crystal clear and ready to go out and drive on the road it also works on areas like chrome plastic or painted surfaces so I'm going to grab my microfiber towel once more and I'm gonna clean the front of this grille this is a jet black grille it also has chrome accents so you want to make sure that we clean it but the EcoSmart is designed to work on all types of exterior surfaces and make sure that it gives the cleanest look possible it's also not wasting any water so a typical car wash to waste over 300 gallons of water so you want to make sure that it looks extremely good when we clean the car now we've gone ahead and wiped off the EcoSmart and we've exposed a nice clean grill as no dirt no debris and it's gonna be protected till the next wash because if you use EcoSmart you don't have to add any wax to your vehicle because the wax built into the EcoSmart is gonna protect it to the next wash if you use it on a weekly basis if you have any more questions about

"hi everybody I'm Kevin with Kendall science we get a lot of questions regarding candle making math calculating your fragrance oils determining how much wax you need for a project and so on if you find this to be a little bit difficult to wrap your head around you're not alone so let's go through this step-by-step the first thing you're gonna need to do is determine how many candles you want to make of each fragrance so let's say we want to make six straight sided tumblers using our cactus flower in Jade the next step is to determine how much each of those containers holds and for that you can reference our website now keep in mind you should always weigh your materials on a scale as opposed to measuring by volume or in fluid ounces we will list the wax weighed for each container that we carry on the product page now that we know that each of these containers hold 8.5 ounces of wax by weight we can multiply that by the number of candles we're making in order to determine how much wax we need total so for this example 8.5 ounces times 6 is 51 ounces of wax so the next step is to determine how much fragrance oil you're gonna need and that does get a little bit more complicated we recommend starting at a 6% fragrance load which is roughly 1 ounce of fragrance for every pound of wax but you can go higher depending on how much your wax can hold and you will always find this information listed on the product page for your wax once you decide on your fragrance oil percentage you can use that number to determine the overall amount of fragrance oil you're going to need for your project and no matter what the batch size this formula is always going to be the same you take your percentage of fragrance oil multiply that by your amount of wax and it's going to give you the amount of oil you need for your project now this is where the math gets a little bit intimidating so don't be afraid to pull out your phone or use a calculator to help you with some of this precise math you may find it easier to convert that percentage into a decimal first and to do that you just divide it by 100 so 6% turns into point zero 6 if you're using 7% would be point zero seven eight percent so point zero eight and so on and so forth but again for this example we're gonna stick with six percent so if you take that point zero six and multiply it by the 51 ounces of wax that we need you're gonna get 3.06 ounces of fragrance and that's the amount you need for your project now mini scales will not be that precise with their calculations so it's okay to round up or down slightly but you're aiming for that three point zero six so now we know we need 51 ounces of wax for this project we need three point zero six ounces of fragrance and that's what we're gonna use to pour these six straight sided tumblers well thanks for watching everybody I hope this video helps you to calculate the amount of wax and fragrance oil you're gonna need for your next project if you liked the video

to help", "IWYuPE8rkeE": "welcome friends today in the kitchen\nwe're gonna do something a little bit special we're going to do the 1880s\nPemberton coca-cola formula and so Pemberton is the guy who invented\ncoca-cola recipe he invented coca-cola in the hopes that\nhe could wean himself off of morphine with cocaine in the end it didn't work\nfor him. so so he came up with this formula and this is out of one of his\nnotebooks and it is by no means the recipe or formula the coca-cola uses\ntoday and they're very adamant about that but by making this it should give\nus a little bit of insight into where this product started and what it tasted\nlike at the beginning and often what things taste like way back then is\nnothing like they do today so I started out with some high proof alcohol you\nwant to get the highest proof that you possibly can and so what I've got is 76%\n152 proof grain alcohol that's the highest that I can get where I live if\nyou can get higher make sure it's food grade make sure that you can drink it\nbecause you can get yourself into very solid trouble if you don't make sure\nit's food grade which brings us to the next thing which are these essential\noils now I first wanted to do this back in 2011 what eight nine years ago I\nheard a broadcast This American Life on NPR and it was all about this formula\nand it really intrigued me and I wanted to do it and at that time everyone said\nto me don't bother you can't get all the ingredients and they were right I\ncouldn't get all the ingredients and you know what I still can't get all of the\ningredients so these are food grade oils that you need to get there in this form\npretty toxic you don't want to touch them you don't want to get them on you\nand there was one in particular that I couldn't get and that is neroli oil and\ntiny a little bottle of neroli oil like this\nthis is five mils of neroli oil was four hundred and eighty dollars us to get\nthis little bottle and the company said to me oh we can get it for you at a\ncheaper break if you buy four hundred pounds it's 1.2 million like I don't\nthink I need 400 pounds of neroli oil so the first thing we need to do is measure\ntiny little amounts of these essential oils and mix them into this alcohol and\nso I've got these tiny little syringes they're one milliliter each and we'll\nmeasure these out being very careful not to cross staminate not to get it on your\nhands and to get the right amounts so the oils we're working with our orange\nlemon nutmeg coriander neroli and cinnamon oil so the first substitution\nis bitter orange oil instead of Naru Li or neroli everyone seems to say that's\ngoing to be fine so this is our 7x formula this is the 7x\nflavoring and we're only going to use a tiny little bit of this for a couple\ngallons of coca-cola very tiny little bit the next substitution that you have\nto make is is the coca part it is illegal to have coca leaves in North\nAmerica and you need coca leaf extract there's no cocaine in coca-cola anymore\nthey they pull that out in a factory apparently in New Jersey and then only\nput in the bittering compounds from the coca leaf but since we can't have coca\nleaves I'm worked around a little bit and I found another extract that has\nsort of the same flavonoid bittering compounds and I'm gonna give that a try\nI think you should probably just leave it out though I'm a little worried\nobviously that wasn't a real coca leaf I'm a little worried that I'm not going\nto get it quite right so now we move on to the sugar syrup\ncomponent so we're gonna start it with some water in a big pot and the next thing is to weigh out the\nsugar so I know that everyone has been freaked out for years that you know\nperhaps way back there was cocaine and coca-cola I would posit that the real\nkiller in this soft drink is the sugar like that's a lot of sugar so and it\ngoes into the water and we want to just we just want to dissolve that we're\nmaking a simple syrup it's we'll just gently heat this and\nstir it until the sugar has dissolved while the sugar is dissolving I am going\nto juice some limes so the sugar is pretty much dissolved and now we just\nadd in caramel okay the sugar syrup is dissolved we\ndidn't bring it up to a boil we didn't really get it hot just warm enough that\nthe sugar crystals disappear into the water next in is vanilla I've got my\nnotes open because I just want to make sure I get this right so in goes the\nvanilla and I normally don't measure vanilla I free pour but somehow this\ntime I think it's important to to measure this is off to the point where\nif you were using extract of coca you would put it in we're not putting\nanything in and I decided not to put anything in in its place\nso next in is the caffeine extract now I know it's called coca after the coca\nleaf and cola after the Kola nut but by 1880 1885 Pemberton already wasn't using\nKola nut he was only using citrate of caffeine so directly he had decided that\nit wasn't the flavor that he was after it was the caffeine that he was after so\nhe stopped using Kola nut at that point and there's no reason to believe that\nCoca Cola is using Kola nut anymore so it's just straight caffeine\nmixture 3.75 mils and apparently this is about five times the amount of caffeine\nthat is in Cola beverages today at the store or any beverage today at the store\nare really high caffeine what's that goes in the lime juice so\nfreshly squozen lime juice and citric acid citric acid is something that is\nnot used in today's coke you can tell that because they use phosphoric acid I\nthink it is on the label they do list the acid that they use and that's it for\nthe sugar syrup okay so we've got our 7x flavor mixture and our sugar water\ncaramel mixture and there's a bit of math involved because you only use a\nvery little bit like 1.5 milliliters per liter of sugar syrup so I need to\nmeasure how much sugar syrup we have and then determine how much 7x to mix into\nit so it looks like two point two five liters so we need three milliliters of\n7x let's see living dangerously there we go mix that in let's just give that a\nstraight-up taste so this is this is really concentrated let's just see if\nit's even edible huh I can see where that's going\nlet's see what Julie thinks a little enthusiastic poor little yes on the\nfirst pour well I mean I want to make sure that the I know that the\ncarbonation mixed with the syrup and also I've over carbonated that keg of\nwater that's you got a kind of a brownish brown tone it smells very\nthere's no interesting there's it over Smith yeah like there's a smell to it\nyeah there I get a lime I do get a lime flavor overwhelming lime flavor okay\nthat's the it's sweet it is sweet it's very sweet but don't you sweet for me\nit's a refreshing beverage I like it it's not coke I think it's too sweet oh\noh no no no no but you can it would be considered a : it's a brown beverage\nyeah it would go well with people who like rum and coke it would do just fine\nPepsi do you think it's like Pepsi I I don't think I've ever had a Pepsi I\ndon't think I've ever had a Pepsi yeah you probably have anyway it doesn't\nmatter um no no but it's I can see how this evolved into coke this doesn't have\nthe bite that Coke has there's a bitter that sort of yeah yeah what I don't know\nthat's a lovely beverage so I would just might we make it less sweet yeah I would\nI would chop it some of the sugar I've definitely chopped it some of the\nsugar and maybe up the amount of 7x so an interesting experiment I think\nit's a worthwhile beverage yeah there's the funny fun right yeah I mean as much\nas we look very you know it is longer it's like we were we're not\nyeah it is a worthwhile beverage it's I would definitely drink it I don't know\nthat it's would stand up against beside a coke but in order to actually test\nthis we are going to do the ultimate Pepsi challenge we're going to test this\nagainst you stated yourself I know again well I am part of the Pepsi generation\nI'm gonna we're gonna do this Coke and Pepsi Canadian Coke and Pepsi okay\nMexican Coke and Pepsi okay Jessica just came true yeah oh okay the actual\nMexican Coke versus Mexican colas yes like the would probably find a hurry\ndose see if we can find the hurry toes Mexican Cola Inca Cola Inca Cola and\nwild card thumbs up thumbs up yeah yeah another colas type in the world and so\nwe'll do a blind tasting of all of them the reality is all of the large\nmanufacturers of beverages have multiple versions of their beverages that they\nserve sell it in multiple nations because everybody has a slightly\ndifferent palate depending upon what the reading and what they're matching it\nwith right so there's so many versions so if you want to try the 1886 Pemberton\nCoca Cola recipe give it a shot I mean there's a couple there's no cocaine\nthat's know so that might change the fact it's not good as exciting might\nhave been long ago with that shot of cocaine I think that's pretty good I\nthink that's pretty good and the fact that we now have two and a half liters\nof syrup I feel like we're gonna have to host a children's party between all the\nother beverages we've made recently yeah pop and chips for everybody two and a\nhalf liters yeah we're gonna we've got a lot of this to go through it next we're\nstopping by see you consume", "zVqunZUuwSs": "today on the stay at home chef I'm showing you how to make the most amazing lasagna you guys should know by now that when I call it the most amazing it truly is this recipe for lasagna is full of authentic flavor and homemade goodness you're gonna love it we're gonna start on the stove with some ground beef and ground Italian sausage you'll want to add a pound of each so we have the Italian sausage and then a pound of ground beef into a large pot over medium heat then grab a spoon and start breaking up all of your meat and get it cooking once you've broken it up a little bit add in one large white onion that you've minced up as well as five crushed garlic cloves stir this in and let it all cook you'll want to make sure you cook the meat through completely before moving on to the next step we're creating a sauce and so it's all about layers and adding things in one at a time and creating a delicious homemade creation it does take some time but trust me it's worth it in the end I used a 93 7 ground beef so that it's nice and lean and doesn't create too much fat and you can see there's not a lot of fat in there some of that is liquid from the onion that has released but we don't want to add too much fat to this the fat that you're getting mostly comes from the sausage and we're not adding in any extra fat either so it all balances out and it works out in the end next we're gonna start developing even more flavors by adding in a secret ingredient one teaspoon of fennel seed this gives it that truly authentic feel sprinkle that in there follow it up with one teaspoon of ground oregano do 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/4 teaspoon of pepper 2 tablespoons of sugar 1/2 a cup of freshly chopped basil and a quarter cup of freshly chopped parsley stir this in real quick those fresh herbs adding a lot of flavor and give this pasta a fresh homemade feel follow that up with half a cup of chicken broth a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes 15 ounces of tomato sauce and then there's a nice secret weapon - 6 ounce cans of tomato paste tomato paste has such a concentrated flavor that we're able to add in a lot of tomato goodness in here with just a couple of ingredients we're really making that tomato flavor come out strong and bold when it comes to this sauce then we simply start stirring it and bring it to a simmer you can already see that this sauce is super Hardy and meaty and it smells absolutely amazing once it comes to a simmer it will reduce the heat to medium-low simmering is the time for your sauce to develop a lot of flavor the ingredients play off of each other and release a lot of different complex flavors as the heat is applied to it so you'll want to make sure that you simmer your sauce for a good period of time you'll want to simmer it for at least an hour and up to four hours for a really developed flavor now if you don't want to do this on the stove you can always put it into a slow cooker on high and let it develop flavor there you'll want to give it just an occasional stir and if it's in the crock-pot you don't need to stir it at all but this sauce is definitely made with a little bit of love and look at how delicious that looks while the sauce is over there bubbling and boiling I want to show you one of the coolest lasagna hacks ever you're gonna take your noodles and put them into the bottom of a dish and I'm just using a 9 by 13 pan you just want to make sure that the noodles don't come up over the sides and then you'll take some hot water just as hot as you can get it right out of the tap and we're going to pour this over our pasta you want to add in enough to cover all of the sheets of pasta looks like I need just a little bit more it took me about eight cups of water to cover my pasta completely now all I have to do is let this sit and soak for about thirty minutes after 30 minutes my pasta will be softened enough to layer in a lasagna dish no boiling required it'll finish cooking in the oven it's a perfect tack to save some time when it comes to making homemade lasagna well the noodles are soaking and the pasta is simmering we'll go ahead and put together our ricotta mixture start with 30 ounces of whole milk ricotta cheese and kind of break that up there you'll add in an egg 1/2 teaspoon of salt a pinch or an eighth of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and then about 2 tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley then you just mix this all together all right now we'll keep this mixture in the fridge until our sauce is done simmering once the sauce is done we're ready to layer our lasagna in addition to what we've already made you'll also need some sliced mozzarella cheese and some freshly grated Parmesan cheese and make sure you use freshly grated because the stuff in the little can just doesn't melt nearly as well and isn't even always real cheese we're gonna start layering our lasagna by spreading about a cup of meat sauce into the bottom of a 9 by 13 pan and I'm using an extra deep 9 by 13 pan you just want enough to cover the bottom so that the noodles get some love down there don't get stuck then we're gonna start layering in our pasta I like to do it just a little bit off you overlap them just a tad and put four noodles four sheets as our base layer then we're going to spread on about a third of our ricotta mixture then layer on slices of mozzarella cheese and I got this cut in the deli section of my grocery store then you'll cover this with another layer of the meat sauce I use about a cup to a cup and a half not just enough to cover that cheese and then I'm going to finish the first layer by sprinkling on about a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese then we're going to repeat this process with more sheets of pasta and we'll keep on layering it and then we're gonna bake this in a 375-degree oven for about 15 minutes remove the aluminum foil halfway through the baking time to allow the cheese on top a chance to brown and then you're ready to eat now I know a lot of you will ask if you can make this ahead and the answer is absolutely you can compile everything and layer everything together in your pan and then just pop it in the fridge until you're ready to serve although I would recommend using and baking it within about 48 hours if you're gonna freeze it you'll want to add a ton of time to the cooking time in order to get it thawed in the center and cooked completely through [Music] thanks for watching you can find the full written recipe in the video description be sure

wholefoods fast tip and today's tip is learning how to measure without measuring spoons and I originally write about this in the splendid tables how to eat supper book and it's something I had kind of been doing for a while but I was never quite sure how accurate I was being when I wasn't measuring and so this kind of provided me with a concrete way to test myself and really get accustomed to how much I was putting in why would you want to learn to measure without measuring spoons well when you're doing cooking something like a soup or you know a casserole you don't really need to be as exact when you're baking is it when you're baking something like a cake so if you're off just a little bit it's not going to matter and it also speeds up your cooking time considerably because you don't have to stop get a measuring spoon you know let's say you need one teaspoon of this one teaspoon of that you don't have to stop and wash between to you know make sure you're not mixing up the flavors in the container so that's why you do it so I'm just going to start and show you her tip and that is to learn how to do it you measure into your hand for probably I would guess like a couple weeks to a month so here's my fourth of a teaspoon so I measure it in my hand and they say okay that's what a fourth of a teaspoon looks like in my hand and then and you do this every time you're cooking before you throw your half a teaspoon of salt into your dish you want to throw it in your hand just to get an idea okay so that's a half of a teaspoon and then you remember that okay that's what a half a teaspoon looks like in my hand and then the teaspoon it's okay so that's what it 1 teaspoon looks like just get used to trying it with the different things you're doing it so if yours calls for half a teaspoon of oregano you know throw it in there four calls for one teaspoon of chili powder throw it in the throw it in here and then in your hand", "rWEWSE2xUq8": "hi guys my name is Hannah and I'm for propane low supply comm today I'm going to show you two very important steps in the excellent candle making the first is how to choose the right wick size for your candle container and the second is how to conduct a proper breath test if you have any questions at all at the end of this video please feel free to email us directly at support at pro candle supply comm or comment below mastering these two steps will ensure that you make the best and strongest burning candles for your customer first we're going to be covering the correct wick size it's important to have the correct wick size for your candle to ensure you have a clean and even burn it also helps you determine an accurate burn time for your candle and it helps you to determine how strong your hot fragrance throw will be the first step in determining the correct wick size is finding the inside diameter of your candle container find the inside diameter of your candle container and then you want to consult the wick guide on pro candle supply comm when you're conducting a burn test it's best to always conduct a burn test with at least three different sized wicks on the same candle as you can see the jars in front of me the diameters of the inside of the candle jars are two point nine four inches if you consult the whip guide a pro candle supply calm you'll see that we recommend starting with an eco ten so today I'm going to be testing an eco 10 and eco 12 and an eco 14 the smaller the wick number the smaller the wick and the larger the wick number the larger the wick but please remember there are different types of wicks such as eco LX and seedy wicks and they're not interchangeable for example an eco 14 wick is not the same as an LX 14 wick they will burn differently it's also important that you ensure that the wax type the fragrance the container and the color is the same on all the candles that you're testing changing any of these the wax the fragrance the container the color the fragrance load any of these factors can greatly influence burn quality so if they change you'll have to Rican duct the burn test but three candles you see in front of me have the same wax no color added and six percent lavender fragrance it's best to label the front of each candle with the fragrance used the sized wick and the percentage of fragran used that way you can go back and reference these details later after you wake and pour the candles that you're going to be testing it's time to let them cure it's best to let them cure at least 24 hours but if you're going to be testing specifically how strong they're hot throw is it's best to let them cure longer because the longer they cure the stronger they are after they're done carrying it's time to cut and light your candles please be sure to cut your wicks to about a quarter inch before lighting I'll be back in a couple hours okay so it's been about four hours in order to conduct a proper burn test you want to let your candles burn about three to four hours depending on the diameter of the candle and then you want them to cool for at least five hours before you conduct another burn test a 2-inch diameter candle should reach its full diameter about pull in about two hours a three inch diameter candle should reach its full diameter melt pool in about three hours after three to four hours have passed you're going to visually inspect your melt pools write down the details and then blow out the flames so let's take a closer look at our mouth pools so as you can see we have our three candles the Eco 10 the Eco 12 and the Eco 14 the correct wick size should not have much flickering the melt pool should reach to the edge of the container and the melt pool should be around a quarter inch to a half inch deep the wick should burn cleanly without a lot of carbon buildup mushrooming or suck being given off the center candle shows all the properties I just described the flame is steady the melt pool is about a quarter inch to a half inch deep it's reached the full diameter of the candle there's not a lot of carbon buildup such or mushrooming going on a wick that is too small for a candle will not give them that pool that reaches the edges of the container instead it will tunnel down the center of the candle with a low flame and even drown itself out the candle right here is a prime example of a wick that is too small it is not hot enough and will likely put itself out the candle to my left is somewhere in the middle it does have a deeper melt pool however it hasn't reached the full diameter brim of the candle as we conduct a second or third or fourth burn test and make it hotter as the candle burns down and it may end up being okay but right now it does not seem to be the correct wicks eyes for this container a wick that is too large for a Campo has a flame that is too big it flickers a lot mushrooms and gives off a lot of smoke Ursa mushrooming is caused by a buildup of excess carbon and actually produces a mushroom like shape at the end of the wick the melt pool is often deeper than a half-inch here's another example of a candle that I waked and conducted a burn test on as you can see one candle tunnel pretty all the way down the center of the candle the other side it burned cleanly and evenly the one that burned cleanly and evenly was whipped with a correct wick size it's very important to conduct multiple burn tests ideally you'll conduct four to five burn tests or until you reach the bottom of the candle for example the candle in the center looks like it's whipped with the correct wick size however I'll need to conduct three to four more burnt us to ensure that the melt pool does not exceed a quarter inch to a half inch deep it's very important that you do these burn tests especially if you're going to be selling your candles to customers customers expect the candle to burn evenly and perfectly all the way down to the bottom okay so the last thing I want to talk about is getting a good hot throw a hot dry was measured by how strong a fragrances in a room when a candle was burning you'll want to experiment with different percentages of fragrances and different wick sizes in order to get the correct hot throw for your candle 6% fragrance load is a good starting point and then you can work your way up to 9% depending on how strong the candle is more fragrance does not always mean a stronger hot throw it's important that you have the proper wick size because the proper wick size provides an optimal fragrance combustion so therefore a candle with a 6% fragrance load and the right wick size may smell stronger than a 9% candle with the wrong wick size so to determine which candle has the strongest hot throw you're going to take each candle and place it in its own broom it's ideal that you keep the room similar in size and ventilation that way they're easily comparable you let them burn for a couple of hours and you decide which room smells the strongest I really can't stress how important this step is when you're creating a new candle on your candle line when you're creating a new candle most of the effort should be put into this step right here it may seem like a lot of work upfront but it's so important because once you know how to make this candle correctly you'll know how to make this candle every single time for years to come so that's all for today I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope that it was helpful if you want to learn more and make your own candles and soap visit pro camel supply.com and be

special video for you i will be eating nothing but pumpkin for the next 24 hours okay so maybe i'm exaggerating a little bit it's not going to be 24 hours more like from the time i wake up to the time i go to sleep but you get the deal so i went out to the store and i got these lovely pumpkins here they look delicious now i like to eat my pumpkins with a little bit of salt and pepper nothing too fancy so ah here goes first bite just kidding i'm not actually going to be eating this pumpkin what i'm going to be using is pumpkin puree so if you like any of these recipes and you do want to try this just be sure to get 100 pumpkin do not get the pumpkin pie spice that's gonna just throw off all the flavors in this video i'm going to show you three main meals two snacks two drinks and a dessert so without further ado let's get cooking there is no better way to start off your morning than with a hot cup of coffee so first we are going to make pumpkin spice latte the cult classic so what you're going to need is some pumpkin puree maple syrup plant milk of your choice i'm using vanilla almond milk pumpkin pie spice blend or you can make your own it's pretty easy lots of recipes on the internet for that some ground nutmeg vanilla extract and you coffee drinkers are going to hate me for this but i am using folger's classic roast which is instant coffee i am going to be using two sticks of this coffee so start off by pouring your plant milk into a pot all of the ingredients and measurements will be down in the description box below so be sure to check that out then i'm going to add in the pumpkin puree some maple syrup to give it a little bit of sweetness and then you're going to add in the pumpkin pie spice and vanilla extract and then you're just going to whisk all of that up together and bring it to a simmer while that is simmering away i prepared a cup and a half of hot water for my instant coffee you're gonna go ahead and pour all of that in of course you can adjust the coffee depending on how strong you want it but once you pour that in you're just going to whisk that up so that it is nice and combined once all of the instant coffee crystals have been combined and dissolved you're just going to pour that into that milk and pumpkin pie mixture and then once again you're going to break out the whisk and just make sure that it gets nice and mixed up at this point you're going to want to very carefully give it a taste here i'm adding a little bit more sweetener and a little bit more milk adjust it if you need to if you don't that's fine as well and then mix all of that up and then you're pretty much done just go ahead and get your favorite mug and it is time to serve your coffee this turned out so good i've actually never had pumpkin spice latte from starbucks just because it's not you know vegan but i think if you want to spice it up add some whipped cream on top add some marshmallows i don't know get creative but it is good as is as well this was so good and it definitely woke me up in the morning by now we are totally hungry so it's time to make some waffles we are going to start off by mixing together soy milk and apple cider vinegar to make a vegan buttermilk for your dry ingredients you're going to need some flour some flaxseed meal i'm using the golden variety but you can use the regular one as well some baking powder pumpkin pie spice couple pinches of salt some coconut oil melted okay let's pause here for a moment this is where i made a very grave mistake when you're doing this recipe make sure that when you have combined all of your dry ingredients you whisk them all together first then whisk all of your wet ingredients together then mix them all together because i poured the wet in with the dry without combining everything first there were clumps of pumpkin spice that would not disperse throughout the mixture so when i bit into it some of it would be bland some of it would have the pumpkin pie spice it would be like a little bit you know too much festivities going on in your mouth so just be sure to mix all the dry first mix all the wet then combine okay you can resume okay and here i'm adding in that vegan buttermilk that we just made go ahead and pour all of that in and i'm adding some vanilla extract some maple syrup to sweeten or you could use brown sugar and of course you gotta have the pumpkin because we're eating pumpkin all day so go ahead and whisk all of that together until it's nice and combined you want to mix it until everything is just combined you do not want to over mix it and yes the batter is going to be pretty thick so don't worry about that so here i've already started heating up my waffle iron i sprayed it down some olive oil and now i'm just pouring in the batter a couple ladles will do it it is an art form so you do have to practice to know exactly how much to put in there but go ahead and put it in try not to overfill it and then when you're done you're just going to close it up flip it over and let it do its thing when it's all said and done you've got a waffle go ahead and very carefully remove it this was obviously pretty hot so don't touch it with your hand if you don't have to use as many tools to get it out as you need and here i am i'm just topping it so i put on a little bit of chocolate syrup just to make it look pretty i'm adding some hemp seeds some walnuts and of course some fruit this is just some frozen fruit that i thought out and just spread around as much as i wanted of course you can top it with whatever you want to top it with but this is just what i went with and of course the final touch was some maple syrup and voila we've got a pumpkin spice waffle that is delicious it is so good and remember what i said make sure you mix up the dry so you don't get a mouthful of cinnamon but otherwise it was definitely very tasty very light very fluffy and soft and i will definitely be making this again ladies and gentlemen it is time for our first snack of the day we are going to be making a pumpkin seed trail mix so i'm starting off with some pepitos which are just some pumpkin seeds just go ahead and pour those into a bowl and then add whatever you like i'm adding some peanuts some pretzels some dried cranberries you can add any kind of dried fruit that you like and some non-dairy chocolate chips when you're done just give it all a mix and it was just as easy as that you've got your pumpkin seed trail mix enjoy responsibly in these colder months we definitely have to stay hydrated so i've got a hot and cold option for you now we're going to make some pumpkin juice you're going to need some apple cider not vinegar some pumpkin puree yet again surprise surprise some kind of fruit nectar i'm going with peach but you could do mango or pear and first you want to shake up your apple cider then pour it into a pot this recipe is not very hard you're basically going to dump everything in so i'm dumping in the pumpkin puree then i'm going in with that peach nectar and you're going to give it all a nice good stir you want to mix it up make sure there aren't any clumps or lumps in there and now i'm adding some spices i'm adding some cinnamon whisking that up then we're adding some nutmeg ginger a dash of allspice and some vanilla extract sugar to taste whisk it all up give your wrist a workout because there is no chill brown vegan recipe without a whisk i guarantee you that okay maybe not but still and just like that we got ourselves some pumpkin juice you can have it hot or you can add some ice and have it cold it is good either way just make sure you try this this is a must try it is so good i have now declared that this is the official drink of fall [Music] next we are going to be making some japanese croquettes we're going to start off with one small kabocha pumpkin now i mean i'm pretty sure it's a pumpkin it might be a squash or something but anyway you need a kabocha pumpkin it's really cool because it's green on the outside orange on the inside you're going to cut it up into pieces and microwave it for about six minutes until it's nice and soft and then with a sharp knife and very carefully you may even want to let it cool down just slightly you're going to peel the skin away from the the meat i guess for lack of a better word you're going to peel it away from the pumpkin when you're done with that you're going to heat up a pan and pour some oil in and then i just chopped up about a quarter of a white onion and i'm gonna saute that until it's nice and translucent like so and then once that's done usually they would add some type of meat to it so i'm just adding this tofu crumble that i had left over if you want the recipe for that go ahead and give this video a thumbs up and i will be sure to share that but anyway you're just going to saute that all together until everything's nice and combined until the onion is nice and soft now back to the kabocha it should be cool enough to work with so you're going to go ahead and mash that up with a fork it's nice and soft and the cool thing about the kabocha pumpkin is that it's not like our north american pumpkin there's a lot less water content it's a little more starchy like a potato it's drier a little more dense but here i am i'm just seasoning it up with some spices everything will be included down below i'm just seasoning everything to taste as you can see i'm not really measuring it pretty sure i just used a little bit of salt pepper onion powder garlic powder a little bit of curry powder once you have seasoned it to your liking you're going to go ahead and mix everything up so that it is all nice and combined and then we are going to add the sauteed onion and the tofu crumble you're going to go ahead and mix that all together i think i used about half of what i had cooked up you're just going to mix it up until it's a nice kind of uniform consistency and now we're ready for the fun part you're going to need some vegan cream cheese i swear by tofutti and what you're going to do is just grab some of that mixture you just made you're going to roll it up in your hands and as you can see it is a little bit messy but that's okay once it has been rolled into somewhat of a ball you're just going to press down in the center making a little well and into that well you're going to place some of that cream cheese just a little bit you don't need too much like a quarter teaspoon i want to say somewhere around there anyway once you have that in there you're just going to fold the ball in on itself so that the cream cheese is right smack in the middle and so you no longer see any of it because what we're going to do is we're going to deep fry this and we don't want all that cream cheese seeping out so as you can see you want the ball to look like so you want the balls to be roughly around the same size so here's what it looks like i made about nine balls out of half of a kabocha pumpkin now we are ready to dredge we got flour just egg and panko bread crumbs get the plain kind they're vegan so you're just going to go ahead and roll the ball into the flour into the just egg and finally into the panko bread crumbs easy as that once you're done you're just going to set it aside and do the same thing to all of your balls and here's what they look like we are now ready to deep fry now you should have been heating up your oil all this time hopefully you did you're gonna go ahead and very carefully lower the balls into the hot oil i'm using a spoon because i've had a lot of mishaps with hot oil and i'm not getting anywhere near that so go ahead and put your little croquettes into the hot oil and then you're just going to fry them up you want them to get a nice brown color so i'd say give them about a few seconds in there you don't want to keep it in there too long just want it to be nice and golden brown it should look something like this this is exactly how you want it to look and then you will just rinse and repeat do this to all of your croquettes until you are done and here i'm just setting them on this rack to cool slightly and also to drain off some of the oil but when you're done you're ready to eat some croquettes this is so good i just put it on a bed of cabbage because that's how i ate it when i was in japan but it was not this kind of cabbage but anyway you can eat it with whatever you want you can have it with a salad you can just eat it by itself they're so delicious they're nice and crunchy soft on the inside and you can put whatever kind of sauce you want you can put mayo and ketchup i put hoisin and sriracha in japan they use tonkatsu sauce and here it is it's nice and crunchy on the outside soft on the inside and you got that nice little bite of cream cheese right in the middle it's a strange combination you would think but it is so good i hope you give it a try it is time for another snack but i swear i do not eat like this on the daily i'm just doing this to show you the recipes but i'm making some pumpkin hummus starting off with some dried chickpeas that i boil and water for about 45 minutes after soaking overnight or for about eight hours to spoil them until they are tender alternatively just buy a can of chickpeas now you don't want to put anything hot into a blender so you definitely want to make sure it cools down first but go ahead and put your chickpeas into the blender now we're gonna add in our spices i do not like raw garlic so i'm putting in some garlic powder but if you're cool with raw garlic go ahead and put in a couple cloves of garlic we're gonna add in some lovely creamy runny tahini some pumpkin puree some olive oil [Music] and a bunch of spices everything will be down below and then a little bit of apple cider vinegar or you can use lemon juice if you have that and then we're just going to blend it all up blend it up to your desired consistency if it's too thick add a little water or olive oil now i'm just going to make it look nice and pretty here i'm adding some paprika and now i'm adding pepitas again because i have them and why not and then just a little bit of olive oil make it look fancy alrighty and now we have our pumpkin hummus this stuff is so addicting it's good it's so creamy and the pumpkin flavor really isn't overwhelming you do get a hint of pumpkin in there so it's really nice now it's time for dinner we're almost at the home stretch we're going to be making some pumpkin pasta i'm using large elbows just because i like them they have a nice bite to them and you can use any type of chicken flavored soup mix you like i have some cream cheese filled rose sausage what i did first was i just crumbled up the sausage and then i'm just sauteing that until it gets nice and crispy when that's done i set it aside and here i'm just boiling up the macaroni noodles until they are soft and now it's time to make that nice creamy sauce i'm adding in some plant milk and honestly i'm just restyling this but i'm adding in some pumpkin puree a lot of pumpkin puree some cream cheese and then i'm just mixing all of that up until it's nice and incorporated once that is nice and smooth i'm adding in that chicken style broth seasoning whatever you want to call that just go ahead and throw that in and since i'm freestyling this i'm basically just mixing and stuff and tasting it and adjusting it to how i like it you're going to heat it up it's going to start to bubble and now i'm adding paprika italian seasoning and black pepper all of this is to taste and i added in some nutritional yeast as well and just to give it a little extra i'm adding in some vialife cheddar style shreds just to give it a more cheesy taste so this is almost kind of like a mac and cheese but you're going to go ahead and mix it all up until the cheese is nice and melted and combined and i'm adjusting i'm adding onion powder garlic powder more paprika and i added just a little bit of agave because i i just do that sometimes when it tastes good for your palate you're going to go ahead and add in your sausage last minute i decided to add in a little bit of spinach that i did press and drain all the water out first so that it did not turn that nice yellow cheesy sauce green and then mix it up and add in your noodles [Music] now i know what cardi b means when she says macaroni in the pot [Music] another day another dollar another meal this is like my quasi pumpkin mac and cheese with some spinach this was fantastic you guys you definitely have to try this one if you don't try anything else you have to try this one it is so good i i'm drooling thinking about it right now and now my friends it is time for dessert we are making some chocolate chip pumpkin cookies so you're going to start off with a bowl we're going to mix in our dry ingredients we got our flour baking soda some salt pumpkin pie spice and then you're gonna mix all of that up together when that is nice and combined go ahead and set that aside and we're gonna get another bowl and into this bowl we're gonna put in some dark brown sugar some granulated sugar some softened but not melted coconut oil and then you're going to get a hand mixer and you're just going to blend that all together make sure it's pretty well blended it might be a little bit chunky but that's okay so now we're gonna add in some unsulfured molasses and some vanilla extract and then we're going to mix all of that up together once that is all nice and mixed up we're going to add in some coconut milk and then some pumpkin puree and once again we're just going to blend everything together until it is nice and smooth and well combined it looks kind of gross but trust me it's gonna get better now it's time to add our dry into the wet let's go ahead and add that in and then i just took a spatula and kind of mixed it up because i didn't want flour to fly everywhere so go ahead and mix that up and get the flour a little wet and then i just went in and mixed it all up again now you will notice that this is going to be a very thick dough but that's how it's supposed to be it's gonna be thick so here i am i'm just dividing it into two portions because we do have some people in the family that do not eat chocolate so half of it i'm gonna make chocolate chip and the other half i decided to put in some dried cranberries and it actually turned out pretty good so definitely try that one as well if you like but at this point i just went in with my hands and folded everything together until i felt like it was nicely distributed throughout and then if you need to you can always add some more you can never have too much right once you have enough chocolate chips or craisins you're going to go ahead and put them on a baking sheet lined with foil or parchment paper and you're going to bake them in the oven and when they're done they're gonna look a little something like this they're soft and pillowy and nice and gooey look at that melty chocolate oh my goodness these were so good this was the perfect way to end my 24 hour pumpkin feast and of course if you have any pumpkin left over don't forget about your little ones pumpkin is totally safe for your little puppers so make sure that they get some of that deliciousness as well alrighty guys thank you so much for watching and

november thankful nuggets now just for a little bit of housekeeping if this is your first time or if you've been here many times but have just been on the fence on what to do i invite you now to hit the subscribe button and the bell for notification also if you like this video be sure to give it a thumbs up and leave a comment down below what are you thankful for today today is the day after thanksgiving our 2020 thanksgiving that was unlike any other year any other thanksgiving that we've had before and today i am so thankful that i was able to come to virginia to see my father yes things have increased and it has been recommended to stay put but i had told my dad that i was going to lay eyes on him at least once a month and so this was the time that i had set to go and see him now i didn't spend a lot of time it is a four-hour drive each way but what i did is i wanted to make him banana pudding now you know i'm not a cook but i can follow instructions on certain things especially if it doesn't involve the oven or the stove top so i made him the this is not your mama's banana pudding and i'm going to leave the ingredients and the directions in the description box below but i this is my third time making it and it is my favorite it is so delicious it was the the biggest challenge for me was finding the chesman cookies that you need to make it please let me know if you've had that this is not your mama banana in before now to me the secret ingredient although i don't know how to make the other banana pudding never had made it before but to me the secret ingredient are the chesman cookies because the regular banana puddings use the vanilla wafers now i like vanilla wafers enough but the the petrish farm chesman cookies are dynamic alone but imagine putting it on banana pudding i'm telling you when you taste this banana pudding you're going to look at it the first bite you're going to look at it and you're going to wonder where has it been all of your life because that banana pudding is the cat's meow it is so delicious it's so creamy and rich and it just tastes better as the days go by you don't have to mix anything on the stove you have all of the ingredients and you mix them all together put them all together layer the bananas layer the cookies and put it in the refrigerator let it settle and you just have added i love it and i know that my father loves banana pudding so when i saw him last month i told him i said when i see you during thanksgiving time i'm going to make you that banana pudding and actually this might be one of the first things i've ever made for my dad because like i said i am not a cook the only thing i can cook and we'll put it in a contest is mac and cheese but i went to virginia and when i got here i said you know once i hit the the final stretch to his home i decided to stop at the stores to buy all the ingredients i went to five different stores on the way to his home and only found one real bag of chessmen cookies one bag i mean i went to a food lion walmart right a cvs because you know you can find chesman cookies sometimes in those pharmacy stores and only one bag of chessmen cookies it was crazy finally the last food lion that i went to had like these many individual bags of chesman cookies and that's what you see sprinkles on top and i put the picture of the finished product as my thumbnail but i also included at the end but yeah i could not find chessmen cookies so i'm wondering if everyone is now making their banana pudding with chessmen cookies however when i asked the people that worked at the stores you know do you have any chessmen cookies in the back they didn't even know what i was talking about they were like chess we don't carry that they didn't even know so i'm wondering what is going on with the chesman cookies so it was my pleasure to make it and um i got to virginia i left late because it was so foggy this morning i got there late in the afternoon and i told my dad i'm just here to lay eyes on you and to make this banana pudding and that is exactly what i did we did take time out after making the pudding because it only took me about 15 minutes to whip it together to go to the grave to my mother's grave to lay her reef her christmas wreath and her christmas arrangement that he made at her gravesite beautiful so i'm excited i didn't stick around for him to taste it because i had to hit the road i'm actually gassing up right now and about to hit the road back to north carolina by the time i upload this and everything i'll be home and settled and situated but i do have a four hour drive i was going to go live while i was driving but since it's at night i need to pay attention because deer are still springing up and i will need to pay attention to the road but i just wanted to come on here and let you know i am so thankful that i a have a father and b i have a father that i can go to and that i'm capable and able to go i know not everyone is able and nor should we really um you know go around our loved ones especially if we hadn't been around them thus far but my father is 82 and i just wanted to you know lay eyes let him know that i still love him we still hear rockin um and everything is going to be fine you know um it's a new normal it's nothing that is fun or comfortable but it's our new normal and this is just the way it has to be so um i took a chance and i'm just prayerful that nothing happened i kept my mask on the whole time he put his mask on i don't even take my mask off in the house i don't even linger in the house i just went to the kitchen did my thing and came back out i you know really i'm not trying i'm not trying to be about that life i was already isolated because i was exposed and i don't want to get coveted it affects everyone differently some people become asymptomatic when they test positive and then some people are hospitalized and even yet some people lose their lives and i don't know how it would come upon me and i definitely would not want to give it to my dad so um i just feel blessed that i was able to sneak out and do this and i'm hoping that he's going to enjoy that banana pudding i'm hoping i whipped it well enough oh my goodness you know it's different when you're in a foreign kind of like a foreign kitchen trying to navigate and find the things that you need but i think i think i i did well by the ingredients i don't always follow the instructions to a tea unfortunately but i'm going to leave the ingredients in the directions in the description box if you make it from this video please post a picture let me know how you love it not like it because you're going to love it and also if you have had it already let me know tell me how long have you been making it what are your thoughts on it i just think it is so yummy even people that typically don't like banana pudding love this banana pudding my daughters they do not prefer banana pudding but when they tasted it they were like oh my goodness and that's another thing i did come to virginia alone um even though all my kids are home my husband and i we still do social distancing with them because especially my oldest two they work outside of the home and you know are are around a lot of different types of people and so i didn't want a chance driving four hours with all of us in one vehicle and i definitely didn't want them to go around my dad so um i am so low i've done this many many many many many times solo so it's not a big deal but i'm used to the drive it's not that bad even though it is four hours you know when you know where you're going you've traveled that road many times it's really not that bad but i just wanted to give you guys a shout out in case i didn't make it home early enough or if i got home and you know got caught up with my family i wanted to just put this out here today as my 27th november thankful nuggets and i want to give a shout out to tales of tea and also really tt for rocking with me especially tells a t every day she's pulling something out there is something positive every day you woke up so that's first of all so thank be thankful for that all right everyone until we speak again remember practice how you play practice so hard that when you play you will always play to win this has been real talk with coach [Music] sherry [Music] you",

eight point six ounces [Music] you", "ut_E0F-7Bpw": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back to dimitra's dishes so today I'm going to be teaching you a very easy and delicious dessert to make perfect for Thanksgiving or for any kind of holiday entertaining I'm going to teach you how to make my apple strudel in a braid form this recipe makes two and you're gonna be really happy that you did make an extra one now we're gonna go over the ingredients and we're gonna get started I have five apples here three granny smith and two Fuji you can use any apples that you like a little bit of sugar for the garnish some egg wash as well for the garnish some cornstarch a little bit of salt some raisins ground cinnamon granulated sugar light brown sugar and a little bit of butter so this is a really simple apple filling recipe I use it to make my Apple phyllo strudel and I'll link that in the card section up above basically what we're gonna do is we're gonna saut\u00e9 the apples and a little bit of sugar and cinnamon and the filling is gonna be ready just like that now I don't own an apple course so I'm gonna do it the old-fashioned way using my knife I peeled the apples I'm just gonna go ahead and remove the core then I'm just gonna slice these apples 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch in thickness and then we're just gonna saute them and we're gonna have an apple filling ready in no time now this apple filling once it's done you can make a double batch of course of this apple filling and just keep it in a glass jar in the refrigerator so that way you can use it on top of oatmeal or even on top of ice cream or to have it handy to make a strudel if you want to make one in a hurry we're gonna go ahead and slice these and then we're gonna move on to the next step so my apples are finely sliced this is the thickness that you're going for let me just show you anything in between these two thicknesses we'll do you don't have to be so precise we're going to begin by melting our butter over medium heat so this is unsalted butter and we're just going to melt it so while that's melting I'm just going to combine the sugar both granulated and light brown sugar with the cinnamon and cornstarch three heaping teaspoons of cornstarch because that is going to be what's going to thicken this really beautifully I'm just going to mix this all up and the bowl so once the butter melts we're going to add the apples in along with the sugar and cornstarch mixture with a little bit of salt we're going to cook this mixture until the apples release the juices and the juices begin to thicken [Music] so once the juices begin to thicken then all you want to do is turn the heat off add the raisins in we're going to remove it from the heat and allow it to cool completely [Music] so you want to make sure that your apple filling completely cool so it doesn't melt the puffs the butter that's in the puff pastry I have two sheets of puff pastry that I've rolled out to 12 by 15 inches and I know that my cutting board is 12 by 15 inches so I just used that as a guide so it didn't have to pull out any measuring tape or anything like that now we're gonna create the braid so the way to do that is very simple first I'm going to cut two little slits on the top and on the bottom that's going to hold the filling in place and then I'm going to cut long slits the same number on one side that I'm going to do on the other side that are going to be folded to make the braid [Music] then I'm going to take half of the filling and I'm just gonna put it down the center now I used raisins in this but you can use cranberries or you can totally leave them out you can also put some walnuts or chopped pecans if you wanted to you can use any citrus you can do lemon zest or orange zest or Clementine zest whatever you have all of that is gonna add more flavor now we're just going to take the top flaps that we cut out and these are going to hold the filling in place and keep it from falling out we're going to overlap these strips of puff pastry creating this beautiful braid pattern and we're going to keep going until it's all ready take this end part and just tuck it in like that and you want to do this on top of a parchment paper because it's gonna be so much easier to transfer it back onto your tray or you could leave it we leave the parchment paper in the tray and do the whole thing on the tray that's fine too I'm gonna do the same thing with the second one and then we're gonna move on to the next step so this recipe makes two braids so if you're having anywhere between eight to twelve guests over to are gonna be exactly the amount that you need trust me on this but if you're not any your only and you only need one the other one you could wrap it in parchment paper and then in aluminum foil and store it in your in your freezer and then right before you're ready to bake it you want to brush it with egg wash sprinkle it with some granulated sugar and then bake it at 400 degrees for 25 minutes about 20 to 25 minutes or until it's beautifully golden on top my oven is preheated I'm gonna pop it in there I'm gonna start warming some water 40 and I'll show you what it looks like as soon as it's ready so in just 25 minutes this flaky beautiful apple strudel is ready just take a look at it it looks like you've been working on it for hours but in reality we know the secret we don't have to tell anyone so you want to let it cool a little bit so that way it's easy to slice now you can serve this with a nice homemade vanilla whipped cream or with some ice cream or just with some nice hot coffee or tea I'm gonna cut this end piece right here just I could still show you how pretty it is on the inside the apples are perfectly cooked they're not mushy or anything like that they're not too firm they're just the way they should be the app the puff pastry is really beautiful and flaky and it has a really nice thick sauce that the juices have created and then you're gonna get a little extra sweetness from the raisins or cranberries if you want to put them in there so the best thing about this is that I have another one in the freezer ready to go anytime I have friends coming over or whenever I just want to bring it to somebody's house it's a great gift to bring my mom always says never go to anybody's house empty-handed so if you do have this in the freezer all you have to do is brush some egg wash and sprinkle some sugar on top of it and just bring it over and everyone will be so so happy with you the recipe as always will be on the

Today on Maker's\nMoments, we'll be showing you how to know if you have the right sized wick for\nyour candle. To figure out if you have the right wick for your candle, it's\nimportant to conduct a burn test. A burn test will help you evaluate the\nperformance of your wooden wick in your candle so that you can narrow down\nthe one that performs best with your wax type and vessel size. Before conducting a burn test be sure to get a wick sample kit and reference the wick selection guide on woodenwick.com to help narrow down the best sizes for you to test. We have links to the guide for burn testing as well as the wick selection guide below. Here's how to conduct a burn test - first, \n make sure your wooden wicks are\ntrimmed to 0.2 inches or 5 millimeters. While cotton wicks are recommended to be at 0.25 inches, that's a tiny bit too long for a wooden wick and can cause\nperformance issues. Place the candles on a heat-resistant surface at least eight inches apart. Be sure there is no draft, and that the temperature in the room is\nbetween 68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit. Light the candles and start a timer for\ntwo hours. Do not leave the candles unattended. After two hours, observe, record details and take photos. At this point the melt pool should be reaching the edge of the container,  but not be too deep. If there is still quite a ways to go to achieve a full diameter melt pool, the wick is likely too small in width which didn't produce a large enough flame to melt the wax properly. This will result in tunnelling, which means that there will be wax buildup on the sides of your container. A new test with the next wick up in widths is suggested unless the issue is that your wick was untrimmed, in which case try trimming it to the recommended length. The wick width will influence the size of the melt pool -  the larger the wick width, the larger the melt pool it was designed to create. Check to make sure your flame is not\nhigher than 0.5 inches, smoking, or that the candle is not too hot in general. If it is, put out the candle and conclude your test. In this case, the wick is too large. At this time, still at the two hour\nobservation point, we like to record the diameter of the burn pool, pool depth,\nflame height, smoke, level of crackle and fragrance rating. Additional recordings you can take include the temperature of the liquid wax to ensure it's not\nexceeding the flash point of your fragrance. The flash point is the highest\ntemperature that your fragrance can be heated to before the fragrance smell\nburns off. You may also want to measure the temperature of the outside of your\ncontainer and any unusual factors that you observe. A spreadsheet is very\nhelpful. Remember, Google sheets is your friend! After four hours, observe and record all of the same details again and gently put out the flame. At this point the melt pool should be all the way to the edge of your container and\napproximately half an inch or 13 millimeters deep. If there is carbon buildup, smoke, or a melt pool that is substantially deeper than recommended, the wick is likely too large and you need to wick down in thickness, width, or potentially both and test again. Once the candle is fully cooled, repeat\nthe process through the life of the candle. Many candle manufacturers wait\none hour in between burn cycles, however we suggest waiting until the candle has\nreturned to a normal room tem perature and the wax is fully hardened. This will simulate how candles are most likely going to be burned in real life. In each cycle you will notice changes in burn, therefore it is very important to complete full life testing to truly know how your candle will burn and what changes if any need to be made. Repeat the process until you find a wick that achieves a full melt pool around 2 hours, and is approximately 0.5 inches in depth\nat the end of every burn cycle. The candle should not smoke and the flame height will ideally be between 0.375 inches and one inch - depending on the size of your candle. Ready to put your newfound knowledge into practice?

everything we did from raw lumber all the way to our final coat we took many different species of wood we didn't even stain them this is all natural we're gonna show you everything that we did step by step how to adhere these together how to create this amazing table surface check us out and visit us anytime at Stone Koch countertops dot-com enjoy the video [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys Mike here with Stone Koch countertops calm today we're gonna take all these different scraps of wood and we're gonna make an amazing table there's a bunch of different species just purple woods and jacobian walnut we got maple we've got all kinds of great great species that we're gonna laminate together and make a really cool project we're gonna show you how to take our epoxy and cover the surface we're gonna show you how to reinforce this so you don't get cupping and and movement on this table for the long haul stay tuned all the tips and tricks are right now first thing what we're gonna do is rip this down into two and a quarter strips our overall table is going to be 2 inches thick when we're done so we're gonna give ourselves two and a quarter so because we know when we bar clamp this together we're gonna have some imperfection but that's where our slab jig comes into play we're gonna show you how to level the sink to perfection it's gonna be very flat and very true so first thing I'm gonna do is set up the table saw and I'm gonna rip this down to 2 and 1/4 inches let's get started okay what we're doing is we're working with some wood that is what they call s 3 S which is sanded 3 sides and some of these are just sanded 2 sides and so you have two edges that are just rough sawn from the the actual mill and so we're gonna put a nice straight edge on one side of these so that we can then measure two and a quarter and cut our pieces accordingly and not have it be wavy down one end so we're just gonna take a nice straight piece of plywood that's already ripped and we're gonna shoot this with our 23 gauge pin nail gun the reason we use 23 gauge nails is because we could snap those off without evidence that you pin nailed it or screwed it or something like that they come out really easy but they hold just perfectly for a cut like this so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start at this end I'll start my board I'm gonna get a measurement on that right here so we know that's about seven inches we'll come down here we'll get this at about seven inches and then we'll see and make sure when we rip this we just rip enough off to make a nice straight cut okay let's check that now and we're going to make sure that no part of that cut will be really see it bows out which is fine so our short points are at the end anyways so I'm gonna take off I'm gonna cut it at instead of seven we'll go six and seven eight that'll cut a nice sliver off of this but it'll make a really good straight edge for us so we're just popping this off now I got pin nails that are protruding and all I got to do is snap these off and on real hard wood trying to pull them out with pliers sometimes it'll leave them proud and they'll be sticking up and they're like needles so you just got to be real careful but if I do this those are nice and flush got one more it will pop that off perfect now I have a really good straight edge on one side of this that we can use and cut as our guide I'm gonna finish doing this stack of lumber we'll move on to the next step [Music] okay we got all the board's cut nice and straight so we put a straight edge on those boards that were just roughs on we're gonna finish cutting those all two and a quarter wide let's do that right now [Music] okay we got everything ripped too up two and a quarter now what we're gonna do is we're gonna cut them to length roughly because when we get this all laminated together it's not gonna be perfect you'll have pieces that protrude further than the others will take and will rip that as one piece but right now we're just gonna get it close so we're not wasting a bunch of epoxy when we laminate this together so I just got my simple t-square we're gonna set that up here we'll go to our shortest points which are right here and I'm just gonna give myself a mark so we can cut this on the chop saw now what's nice about our cut off pieces you can always save your cut off and use them on small projects and art projects and different ideas that you have you can even make a table out of scraps so we're gonna go ahead and cut all these down and we'll start our next step after that [Music] what we're gonna do right now is we're going to plastic the surface off because when we epoxy our and laminate this table together we don't want it laminate into our table so the plastic will act as a barrier between the table and the wood that we're laminating [Music] so what we've done is we've really separated color so that we didn't have any one color taking over a section we try to spread out the color I love what Mother Nature has done with these different species of wood and how you bring it all together and the beauty found in an unstained finish is is just crazy this is going to be such a fun table to laminate together we took the time to do this now as opposed to doing it after we've started the epoxy process because then it's going to be a fluid easy system we're gonna get it right put together without any worries so we got this set up we're gonna go ahead and get some bar clamps ready we'll get our epoxy mixed up and laminate it together we'll be right back alright guys we've got this all set up we added a couple more blonde boards we really liked the contrast what do you think of the contrast match it looks great I like how the orange really pops it's not too much it's just it's amazing on what Mother Nature can create here was not out of stain and all the different colors it's really amazing I agree I I I never was a big fan of purple but this purple heartwood it's got me sold and I can't wait to see what it looks like with the epoxy on there so what we're gonna do now is we're actually gonna take these boards we're gonna brush our regular stone coat countertop epoxy on each of these pieces we're gonna mock it up we'll squeeze it together with our bar clamps we'll get everything pretty square on the ends we're gonna come and cut those ends after it's all dry anyways but we're gonna pound down this and we'll get it all nice and tight get it all clamped up and that's why we have plastic you know you can't put bar clamps underneath and and rotate them but because we have a really flat table and pretty big feet on our bar clamps we're just gonna do them all from the top that way we don't get epoxy that drips on our bar clamp that we have to pop off later so we're gonna go ahead and get all this epoxy it up and clamp together and we'll let it sit let's get started you ready bud alright here we go [Music] okay we've got some Part A and Part B of a regular stone coat countertop epoxy mixed up we're just gonna use our shop brush and we're gonna go through here we're gonna brush one side we'll put it together you can do both sides if you want but one side is gonna laminate really well this is like the best glue on earth and you'll find that out if you ever try to pull something apart that's been a poxy together alright so what we're gonna do is just brush this out get a nice even coat on these boards and we'll love we'll do each board down the line here and it will be a great great Asian yeah get another batch mixed up and we'll start on that end Mitch and we'll just keep going right down the line here oh yeah no biggie [Music] we're now going to use our bar clamps and we're gonna start squeezing this together we're not going to crank it too tight until we take our board and our hammer and we'll start tapping these down to hold some of the crown down a little bit and then we'll we'll clamp it super tight and let it sit overnight let's do it [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay guys what we're doing now is we're putting these blocks in to hold our boards down you don't want any cupping going on because of our bark plants so these are holding everything down nice and tight we've taken some masking tape and we put it on the bottom side of the 2x4 because if we didn't this is gonna glue to our wood when we take these off the the masking tapes gonna glue to the wood but the planner will plan that right off for us but we won't get tear out ripping the wood apart because the epoxy would bond those really really well all right we're gonna go ahead and put this right here on the end Mitch I'll start and then you could we'll just get it loose we'll both clamp it together right now this is raised a little bit off my deck and when we do this it's gonna make it super tight all right you ready to go let's do it boy the epoxy now gives you a great idea of what this thing can look like when we're all said and done man what do you think what's funny is you still you know we had saw marks and all this wood and everything and and and it doesn't even it's not even close to wood it's gonna look like but it's still awesome yeah I'm all the way down nice and tight to the deck and we got this semi straight here you know we we got all the board's pretty close so we don't have a bunch of waste when we cut this apart but get everything nice and tight yeah that's nice and tight good yeah I'm not getting any movement out of those we have a little bit of lipids here and there but the the router jig is gonna take care of all that so we're gonna let this dry we'll come back after this is all dry and we're gonna start planing it we'll see in a little bit okay guys we've let this set up overnight we're going to start deep prepping it right now take all of our clamps off and we're gonna pop this up remove the plastic we'll husband's tape that has stuck to the underside and things like that but then we'll get this prep to start leveling with our slab jig let's do this [Music] okay guys we got all the clamps off and all the plastic off of our slab here what you have to remember when you're using plastic use three mil plastic or thicker don't use thin painters plastic because it's gonna tear it you really try to pull it off because it's gonna have some adhesion but a three melt gives you something to pull on and it won't tear apart and leave little strips for you that's a good tip what we're gonna do now is we're going to set up our slab jig to the thickness of our actual slab I'm gonna show you the distance right now of our jig versus our table so what you see here is we have a very little distance between our table and the actual jig and my router bit is about 3/4 of an inch thick and so we're gonna need to raise this table up now I can adjust my router down no problem but our hole jig needs to come up so that it will give us some room so I'm going to use 2 by 4 runners right along this edge and that's going to give us the opportunity to lift our jig if you have a really big jumbo slab you can build that up whatever thickness you need as long as it's the same on each side so if you wanted to do two 2x4 skis you get a really thick piece of wood you are gonna go ahead and plane down that's what you do if you need more table space rip those down to two by twos whatever you need to do just to just to lift this up on our wheels only take up about one inch on each side so that you don't need very wide strips to lift this up but because we got plenty of room on our ends we're just going to use regular two by fours to lift this up to the height we need let's do that right now [Music] [Music] okay guys so now we have inch and a half lifted here on our runner so our jig is actually going to ride up another inch and a half so we have a lot of distance here between our slab and our router now I got a 3 inch planing surface planing router bit whenever you hook this up you want to make sure it's really tight you don't want any vibration on this bit you're using a big router bit so just be careful so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna loosen my base let's actually get this through I'll loosen that base don't ever do this while the routers plugged in and now I'm just gonna make sure my bit will hit and it sure will so I'm gonna now find the low point on my slab so that we can set our router bit to that particular point so what I'm doing is I'm just making sure that my bit when I rotate this down it will come down and hit the top of my table without extending my router too far and that works really good now I'm gonna pull it up off that surface and I'm gonna use a tape measure to find the low point of my slab is I'm gonna just get a measurement here some one in fifteen sixteenths there I'm one in fifteen sixteen right there I'm two inches let's just go down my slab and see how thick we are there's two inches there's there's one in fifteen sixteenths there's two it's pretty even which it should be we ripped everything down but on a wood slab you're gonna have more coverage and things like that okay now that we have our slab jig lifted up an inch and a half off of our deck we're gonna set our planting bed and we know that we're pretty even across this so I'm gonna go ahead and just get get an eyeball here and I want to be about an eighth of an inch up so I can adjust this where my router is about an eighth of an inch off the deck and we'll test that out and make sure we can plane everything down I may I may have to get up go a little lower but I can always go a little lower if I want to alright let's set this up don't ever set that while the routers plugged in always be safe we're gonna put our mask on our ears have eye protection let's go for this right now another thing you're gonna want to check is make sure that your stuff is gonna stop your router bit from hitting your jig and it sure will right there we're set at a good spot we're ready to go [Music] okay here what we're doing is we're taking three quarter by three quarter-inch steel bars we've cleaned those with acetone we've gotten them all ground down with our 50 grit metal sanding disc so that we get great adhesion we're rotting out pockets so that we can insert these steel bars and have them flush under our table that's really important so that you don't feel them when you rub your hands and knees underneath your table these steel bars what they're gonna do is they're gonna reinforce this table so that it doesn't cuff or warp we're also using our semen crack fill to put these into the table or semen crack fill is very very strong and it dries in about three hours in the sandable in about three hours it's a great product to be able to embed things as well as fill cracks and crevices in your project you're gonna see that be used a little later on in this project you can also use a bondo spreader to spread our semen crack fill to fill in these joints when using our semen crack fill to embed these steel bars pour a little bit of material in the router tout joint put the bar in and then simply add a little bit more material and use a bundle spreader to make it flush you can come back and check your work you have about 15 minutes of working time to work with this okay after the semen crack fill has all dried now we're ready to sand off the excess and remove all the marks from our router jig we're gonna use a 50 grit metal sanding disc we have a link to this on our site as well this disc will get rid of these grooves very quickly and removes a lot of material with ease if you use a normal sanding disc it's gonna take a much longer time and a lot more effort this is a great tip and trick to really expedite this process after the 50 grit metal sandy dis deficit continues we will progress to normal wood sanding discs but right now let's remove all of these grooves so we have a nice flat surface at this time we're going to use our t-square and give ourselves a nice straight line so we can cut the end so we have a really flush surface we like to do two passes but we don't run that blade all the way through at one point so we get a great time after cutting our end grain we're gonna use our 50 grit metal sanding disc to clean up that cut I can't let me do right here so because there's a little more epoxy because these are bigger it's a little harder I'm gonna break this apart okay so you can see that epoxy holds stronger than that piece of wood is holding this is walnut right here and that walnut split not at the joint where the epoxy is has split on the wood that is awesome if you run the strategy process you can see it is extremely extremely how's that look perfect so there's no okay the next step that we're doing here is we're making a mixture of our semen crack fill we're doing a one-to-one ratio and we mix it for about two minutes after we've mixed it we add our thickener the reason we're adding thickeners so that the semen crack fill doesn't go all the way through these cracks and crevices and thickens it up and makes a great paste we add a little bit of our color here we're doing our metallic bronze but because these cracks are so thin it doesn't jump out at you like a metallic color it looks like a very natural deposit in this table we're gonna overfill these cracks and then we're gonna come back after it's dried and sand everything flush and this really sets us up for our next step when we do our seal coat so that we don't have our seal coat dripping and and going through these tiny little voids so we've gone through our table and we look for any little pit or crack and we're just over filling any of that now we are making a mess on our surface and that's okay we're gonna come back and sand off all this excess right after this dries we like to use a bondo spreader after we've applied our semen crack fill to make a nice flush joint I need to point out also we have not done our finished sanding we've only done our 50 grit sanding disk up to this point some of our favorite benefits to using semen crack bill is that at zero vo C and it's fast drying it's not gonna hold your project timeline up because usually in about three hours it'll be tag free and ready to sand here we're gonna use that fifty grit sanding disk and we used one on this entire project and it didn't clog up we're ready to router the edges of our project now we like to use a 1/4 inch router bit on the top and a 1/8 inch router bit on the bottom this is a really clean look to your project we also like to use a sanding disc by hand on those edges as opposed to using a power sander on the edges so that we don't deform that nice clean routered edge after we've routed our edges we're ready to use our random orbital sander and remove all of those initial scratch marks caused by our angle grinder and that metal sanding disk here we're gonna start with a 60 grit sanding disc and we're gonna move through 60 grit 100 grit 150 grit and we'll stop at 220 grit on our random orbital sander we really take our time with that first pad or 60 grit pad to remove all of those swirl scratch marks you need to do this so that when you wet out your surface you don't see swirl marks coming through that epoxy the epoxy is amazing and it will really bring the grain to life but if you've left scratch marks from your low grit and you're standing it's gonna show through so take your time and have fun this is honestly one of the most relaxing parts of the whole project and it's also one of my favorite now we're ready to bring this project to life we're gonna do our first seal code we're gonna mix up one ounce per square foot and we're gonna pour it right on this wood surface now what is a porous surface so if we were to start with a big thick flood coat all the air trying to escape this wood would cause stubborn bubbles in our project that we don't want so we're gonna start with a very thin coat and we're gonna squeegee it on using a normal shower squeegee when we pick our squeegee we don't like one with metal parts on it so that we don't risk scratching our finish sanded surface so we're simply gonna spread this epoxy out and we're gonna work the epoxy towards the edges when we get the epoxy towards the edges we're simply going to roll it over that edge using a controlled motion with our squeegee and we'll come back with our gloved hand and we'll rub it in the surface as you can see here we're just rolling a little bit epoxy over that surface and then we'll come back and rub it in it's a really fun part of this project because you get to see what this wood really looks like when you apply our stone coat counter top epoxy it honestly brings it to life all right what we've done is we've done our first seal coat and now we're ready for our second seal coat one thing I want to keep in mind is when you do your seal coats you're not going for perfection you would need a flood coat to have everything level out perfect we're just getting the surface wet and you're gonna see that some wood is more porous and soaks in the epoxy than other parts of the wood so some of the alder has really soaked this in and so what we're gonna do is sand this with 220 grit we'll sand the edges we'll sand the round overs by hand don't use your power sander on the round overs because we don't want to mess up that perfect shape we'll simply go through those first sanded by hand and then all the flat spots of the surfaces we'll do with our power sander we'll get everything sanded we'll wipe the dust there's no need to use a solvent we'll wipe the dust and we're ready for our second seal coat again this is done with the same stone co count ur top epoxy that you're gonna use for your flood coat it's the same product it's just applied much thinner when you do the seal coats here we go [Music] a quick tip for you is on your first seal coat you're gonna have bubbles and it's really gonna show you where you need to concentrate where you need to fill again you're not gonna be perfect and that's okay don't worry each seal coat it gets better and better it's like unraveling a Christmas present so here I can see some divots and dips and nibs and nubs and those kind of things so I sand it a lot of that off but don't try to sand this perfect leave those imperfections all we're doing is roughing the surface up you don't have to get it perfectly flat each and every time we're gonna build these coats up also on our edges if you do have drips that's what you want to get rid of each time you don't want to have bumpy edges so use that power sander on the flat part of your edges and make those nice and smooth and then when we proceed to the second seal coat it's going to come out even better than the first let's get started [Music] all right we're ready to pour our second seal code let's get started [Music] now I'm not gonna push anything over my edges just yet I'm gonna get what we call the field of the project we're gonna get the majority of the inside square footage and we'll just push it up towards the edges and then when we're when we're ready to do the edges will have plenty we won't have wasted a bunch over the edge man this really brings this to life okay now I'm ready to push it over my edges let's go ahead and do that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I look at that edge so I'm just using those drips over the edge to coat my edges you're gonna you don't need a lot of material on those edges so you just push a little over get it to start dripping and then come smooth it on out keep that plastic clean and then any epoxy that sits over that edge on the plastic there's your reserve right there if you need a little bit more so the final step of this seal coat is what we call mowing the lawn we're gonna start at one end and we're just going to do long strokes so that everything gets somewhat even and then we'll go through and rub those edges one last time because we won't be pushing some epoxy over the edge in in different amounts and so we don't want wavy edges let's do that right now [Music] now you don't need very much torching on the seal coats you don't want to try to remove the bubbles with the torch because you'll burn your wood it still doesn't have a lot of protection from the epoxy so we're just gonna do a quick torching but a quick tip when you use a torch is I'm gonna have some dust in this torch so I don't want to start blowing this right on my surface so I'm gonna start off the surface let it start make sure there's nothing in that torch head and now we're ready to do a quick torching [Music] [Applause] using stone coke countertop epoxy on your projects is really easy to do as long as you have the right steps follow the steps that we're showing here in this video and you're gonna get amazing results we've been through the trial and error we used to put on too thick of coats and we would get problems with air air would almost make it white and foggy in areas when it was really porous would so be sure to follow these steps do your seal coats until you're completely sealed once you're sealed that flood coat is gonna be magic for you all right well we're gonna let this dry we're gonna put our radiant heater in here really heat this room up because we're gonna do a seal coat at the end of the day we'll get to seal coats done in one day we'll see in a little bit okay guys we're ready for our third seal coat we did our second seal coat about eight hours ago and it's dry pretty well but there's still a little tacked to that it's still very very fresh and because it hasn't been 24 hours we can apply our third seal coat without sanding if you're new at this I always recommend waiting 24 hours sanding between coats wiping the dust and applying another coat but because it's still tacky and we did this today we can apply the third coat without sanding we're going to apply this in the same manner with a squeegee we'll let it dry and we'll be able to sand and do our flood coat tomorrow let's get our third coat on right now [Music] alright folks we've got our third sealcoat completed we did that the same way that we did the first two we're gonna let this dry overnight we'll come back and we'll sand and we'll apply our flood coat we'll see in a little while hey we got our third and final seal coat all wrapped up here and inevitably on a wood slab project especially around knots and cracks or little stubborn areas you'll get these little tiny bubbles that just never seem to fill up they they want to blow air out cause a little bubble and that's the epoxy doesn't sink down into that area so I'm going to show you how to save yourself from these problem areas where you don't have to keep doing seal coat after seal coat we use a burnin stick we actually have pieces of our our burnin stick we use these all the time they look like a giant coloring cran and you can get them from a company called Mohawk we have a link on our website to the actual burnin sticks that we get you can get whatever color you'd like and then this will fill these little tiny problem areas we're gonna sand these bubbles down flush fill them with our burnin stick and then sand that flush after we do that we'll sand this entire top with 220 grit sandpaper and then we're ready for our final flood coat let's get started so I got a bubble and some bubbles right here we're just gonna fix these one at a time so we don't lose them out we won't sand the whole thing we'll just sand these problem areas and fill them and then move on to the next spot [Music] so now here you can see these little pin dots that are voids in our surface and this is what we're looking to fill this is exactly what would cause you problems when you keep trying to seal code so we're going to use our burnin stick to fill those right now when using the burnin stick just make sure you get it nice and hot at the tip and then you're going to rub it in like a coloring cran another thing I like to do is sometimes heat that up while it's on the surface and then just rub it one more final time so it really pushes in that little divot what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a razor blade to get most of this burnin stick off the surface and then we'll sand one final time with 220 to make everything almost invisible keep in mind when you're looking for bubbles you can sand those off and you'll know real quick was it a high point or was it a bubble if it's a bubble you'll remove the top and it'll become a slight divot that's what you're looking for for the burn and stick so just use your sander as your friend take a few minutes before you do your final flood coat to really look for any problem areas and then you won't need to do another flood coat we never want to waste epoxy folks so that's why this step really helps in mitigating those problems okay now it's time to remove our excess burnin stick after we filled our little divots and what I like to do is heat it up and then take our straightedge razor blade and just remove the excess it's really that easy now we're ready to sand the whole top after we have done this and take it down to 220 grit okay now I'm ready to sand because I've got all my little pin dots filled and addressed and I'm ready to get this to 220 grit on the entire piece we do 220 grit because that's a good mechanical bond you don't need to go higher than that it's gonna hide all of our sanding scratches when we do our flood coat what I'm gonna do is use 220 grit sanding disc right here on the edge by hand and then I'll do the flat part of the edges and the surface with my random orbital sander let's get started [Music] [Music] okay what we're gonna do now is we're gonna move our tabletop into another room that's a little less dusty the reason we do that is so that we don't have dusts falling into the surface of our brand-new tabletop with our flood coat when you're doing your seal coats doesn't really matter these are never gonna lay out perfect in fact you don't have enough epoxy at one ounce per square foot to level out so you're gonna get an imperfect surface and that's what we have here now we're gonna do our flood coat in our finish room and that's going to come out just awesome if you don't have a finish room you can use a PVC pipe structure that you can make and then drape some three mil plastic over that structure so that it doesn't touch your table but it will stop anything from falling into it it also traps the heat really well all right I'm gonna move this and we'll get started on our final flood coat we'll see in a moment okay guys we're getting ready to flood coat our project we're just gonna mix up enough material to have three ounces per square foot on this flood coat we'll start with Part B we'll do equal parts one-to-one ratio by volume not by weight we're gonna do Part B and then we'll add Part A let's go ahead and mix this up if you haven't seen our video on how to mix go check that out it's really simple just follow these few easy steps let's get started [Music] make sure your your surface has been wiped down with a paper towel you don't need to use a solvent or a tack cloth just wipe any of the excess dust right off that surface and you'll get a great flood coat it's also important to keep in mind when you mix your material put your material in front of a space heater for a little while so the the epoxy will flow out really nice out of the containers it's nice to have have it warm so that when you do trowel it out it's not really really thick like honey it'll trowel really easy just like we're about to show you you don't want to leave your material in the bucket for a long period of time if you do that it's going to heat up and generate heat and you'll lose working time you want to get it out on the surface and then you have all the time you need to get this bubble free here we go [Music] you [Music] now because I scrape the bucket into this mass of epoxy I'll use my 1/8 inch square notch trowel to go ahead and move that around so that it all mixes really really well now because we heated this up it's moving really easy on our surface so let's try all this out we're not gonna push it over the edges quite yet we're gonna get the field all coated and then we'll come through and address all those edges very very carefully so we don't waste any epoxy the nice thing is is if you take a little bit of extra time here you don't need to mix up more epoxy than what you need because you won't be wasting it over the edges oh my goodness look at this this is just this is just beautiful I love this project I'm very proud of it so I'm simply gonna go through here use my square knot straw to spread this out the square knot straw gets everything gauged at the right thickness so that it'll level out for me really well another thing to keep in mind with the square notch trowel is it's designed at this angle so at this angle that's about the angle that you want it when you're troweling out so that's what you're looking for you don't want to turn your trowel really really tight like this you want to keep it up at that same angle and you'll get the right amount of material on the surface all I'm doing now is just using this little bead of epoxy to start rolling it over my edge come through here and get some excess just gonna start addressing this back edge before I move on to the front edge there I'm just rolling enough over the edge so that I could come back and brush that in and get it nice and even [Applause] [Music] [Music] so now we're just gonna chop out any of those trial lines and this also helps to mix the material one final time when mixing like this you don't get any sticky spots in your surface because you basically mixed it three times you mixed it in the bucket you mixed it again using that trowel and finally using this brush when we do this it looks like you're just really dimpling and ruining that surface but we're so new in the working time it's gonna level out great for us and I'm just doing a random pattern chopping this out helping it mix removing any trowel marks and then I'll start addressing my edges and start torching when you torque you want to torch at least three times and really look at those bubbles when you look at those bubbles you'll see that you get the majority of them out with the first torching but you don't want to focus that flame on the same place for a long period of time come back in about five minutes torch it again and then finally torch it a third time [Music] okay I got a bunch of bubbles in the surface from mixing and chopping and troweling now we're gonna start our torching process we just used propane with a good burns o matic torch head you want to get one that has holes in the neck so that when you turn it upside down the flame doesn't go out we have a link to this product as well on our product page so you know exactly what torch we're using let's go ahead and pop these bubbles and we're gonna do it three times [Applause] again we're not trying to get it all at once we're gonna do this three times so just keep that torch moving in a nice steady pace I pretend I'm hosing off a driveway with the hose about that pace keep in mind when you're torching not to overlap over your plastic too long because you'll melt that plastic that's a nice hot flame so just be careful and be aware of your masking in your room so that you don't cause holes in your masking now what I'm gonna do because it's torched our first time is I'm gonna go address those edges but this time I'm not gonna roll my brush over the surface I'm gonna keep it right on that router edge and just do those edges with really long strokes okay let's torch this a second time here we go [Music] [Music] boy this is laying out like a sheet of glass we're just gonna torch it one more time and then we're gonna walk away will be all said and done here we go [Applause] [Music] hey guys we like to wait a few days before we actually install our legs so we'll come back in about four or five days we'll flip this over and we'll show you how we install our legs and remove the drips with our 50 grit metal sanding disc we really hope you enjoyed this video we had an absolute blast making this project I can't tell you enough how these colors glow that the pictures don't do it justice but the pictures still look pretty dang good I just can't believe how this came out I'm very excited about it I can't wait to use this table please comment below let us know what kind of project you'd like to see next would you like to see a three-dimensional piece of driftwood get coated so you learn how to do these 3d objects or would you like to see another River table with a new technique you let us know below and we'll get it out as soon as we can again

of you are well uh before we are going to start a new chapter today we are going to start a new chapter chapter two lesson one fractions and decimals i will do with you one uh problem solving from the last lesson it will be page 60 question number one this question is in your booklet okay now let's go to this question and read it eliot drove to 102.8 miles and used 6.5 gallons of gasoline and benzene how many miles did he travel per gallon of gasoline the amount of gasoline 6.5 will be divided divided to divided by 202.8 to know in one in one in one gallon of gasoline how many miles he drove so i will divide my question is and so i am solving question one page sixty okay now you are going to divide 2 0 to the 5.8 divided by 6.5 what my first recipe should be i should get rid of the decimal here in the divisor i will move it one step as if i multiplied by 10 the same way you are going to move the decimal also one way as if you are multiplying what you are doing for the divisor you should do it for the dividend now you we are going to do long division 8 divide 65 now i will say table 65 i will say 65 times 1 65 then 65 times 2 10 12 13 130 65 divide the 3 multiply 3 15 18 119 so it is 195 uh by 4 and i will stop after that okay 20 24 to 26 so 260. now let's go back to our number here you are dividing by two the divisor is two digits so you are going to take two digits 20 20 is too small comparing with 65 so it will be zero and you will go what with 202 what number you multiply by 65 it's closer to 200 to i don't have 202 i have 195 it is by 3 so i will write here 3. 3 times 5 15 or 3 times 6 18 119 subtract 12 minus five seven nine minus nine zero one minus one zero now ask the eight to go down seventy eight divide sixty-five it is one one times 65 65 subtract 3 and here 1. now i still have 13 as a remainder and i don't have any digits left but i can put here decimal because when i multiply by 10 my decimal moved here so it is time to ask the decimal to go up and you can add zero here and you ask the zero to go down i need the division to finish 0 at the end still i have 13 so what did i do i will ask the decimal to go up and imagine that i have many zeros here you can put any zeros you want you ask the 0 to go down so you will get 130 divided by 65 it's 2 so 130 and the division finish so you will write here the answer is uh you will see 200.2.8 divide 6.5 equal do like that move the decimal move the decimal and write the answer 31.2 in the question when they say how many my so my unit here is miles so in each he will drove his car for 31.2 miles in each gallon in each connecticut benzene he will drove his car 31.2 miles now i hope you understand now more how to divide and let's move to our lesson it is chapter two lesson one okay and miles the title of my lesson is the title of my lesson is fractions and decimals i will send for you the pictures for this lesson fractions and decimals okay this is lesson 2.1 chapter 2 lesson 1. i will send the pictures for this lesson microsoft teams okay so you can you can uh solve with me when you watch the video please open your microsoft teams i'll post and you will find this lesson okay now in this lesson we are going to change uh decimals to mixed number or mixed number to decimals for example i have if you go to the question number a 0.5 they said write 0.5 as write 0.5 as a fraction and 1.25 as mixed number so i have this question has two parts the first part they need 0.5 to be written as a decimal and 1.25 to be written as a mixed number because it's decimal decimal level x number will mix number nine um they said um write 0.5 as a fraction read this number or read it what is it 0.5 it is 5 10 5 10 i can write it as a decimal and i can write it as a fraction here 5 over 10 this 0.5 equal to 5 tens because when you read it it is 5 10 if you look at 5 10 okay this is a fraction but it need to be simplified uh i can simplify the number up and the number down by one uh by the gcf by g c f greatest common factor what is the greatest common factor for 5 and 10 what number you can find in table 5 and in table 10 okay if you go to 5 5 times 1 equal 5 and what about 10 2 times 5 equal 10 so what is the common number what is the common factor between the five and the ten it's the five so i can divide the number up five and five five divide five it's one or ten divide five it's two so i wrote 0.5 as a fraction it is equal to half 0.5 is equal to half number one i change it as a fraction okay then i simplify by uh by dividing both numbers allah the gcf greatest common factor and i notice that five is the greatest common factor between the two numbers so my decimal 0.5 change to a fraction half and it is in the simplest form now let's do the second part 1.25 this is addis amani i need to write it as a mixed number what is the mean of x number mixed number means fraction plus whole number this is called mixed number so i will change it to a mixed number yeah i need fraction whole number a whole number it's a clear one 25 how you read this number it is 1 and 25 and you are far from the decimal two places so i can write it like that instead of writing one point 25 i can write it one with 25 100 now this is a mixed number we call this next number now i need to simplify you are going to simplify only the fraction the whole number will stay the same you will look for greatest common factor go to 25 what times what give you 25 of course 1 times 25 give me 25. and 5 times 5 give me 25 let's go to the 100 is there any comment between 100 or 25 yes 125 times 4 will give me 100 okay and of course you can write if you divide it by 5 20 you can't write and if i divide 120 times 5 will give you also 100. now look here what is the common between the two i have the five and i have the 25 what is the greatest between them it is 25 so i will here the 25 is the command between them i will divide this number by 25 and this one by 25 l1 will go down 25 divided 25 it's one 100 it will divide by 25 if i divide 100 by 25 what is left 4 so so if i go back to my question my question is 1.25 i need to change it to mixed number it will be one one out of four one one hello and zero point five i change it to a fraction and it becomes half so my lesson today is how to change from decimal to a mixed number or from decimal to fraction let's do another one okay uh we finish page 69 let's go to page 70 okay in page 70 i have they said write six with three eight as decimal okay i this is a new way i can solve it it will still hold now i need to change three and eight as a decimal uh if i notice uh what times what give me 3 3 times 1 give me 3 and 8 it is 2 times 4 equal 8 8 times 1 8. so what is the common between them l1 and i can't divide by one my fraction will stay the same so in this case what i am going to do i will divide long division three and eight okay now three is a whole number the three is too small the first the multiple in uh table e3 is a three then six then a nine three six nine twelve fifteen there is no sorry the multiple of 8 8 16 24 32 the first multiple in table 8 is a not a 3. so what i should do look what i will do this is a whole number where is the decimal in the whole number yes here is the decimal and when you say can you divide three by eight zero then you ask this decimal to go up then as i said before i can add zeros how much i need from this side so my number becomes 30 don't look at that decimal it is up now my number is 30 30 divide eight look at the multiple i can't find 30 because i have 32 i will take 24 1 2 3 so by 3 3 times 8 24 subtract this will be 2 and this 10 6. i need more zero i will give her 60 32 40 48 56 64. okay so i i there is no 60 there is 64 i will not take 64 i will take 56 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 by 7 7 by 8 56 subtract 5 this is 10 4 now i will drop another zero i will drop zeros as much as i need but after putting decimal here now 40 divide eight yes i have it it's five forty zero now let's go back to our question it is six with reality eight six will stay six but the three and eight will become what three seven five so i would write six whole three seven five so i change this mixed number to a decimal this is a decimal in whole it's there before and with three eight it becomes 375 okay you understand how i am solving okay let's do another one in the same page okay on the number line okay no don't i don't want to solve now in the number line skip can we go to the second page i will leave this part for tomorrow let's go to page yes page 71 they said share and show okay let's go to question number one they said write as a fraction or as mixed number in simplest form let's go to question number one they said for you 95.5 okay they wanted to be written as a mixed number in the simplest form next number what did we say whole plus fraction okay in whole is 95 it will go down now read this decimal what is it it is 0.5 or 5 10 it means i can write it as a fraction ninety five or five out of ten but they asked us to write it in the simplest form that means you need to simplify you are going to simplify this look for the greatest common fact what is the greatest common factor between five and ten it is five divide 5 divide 5 so my number will be 95 1 2. so i wrote this decimal as a mixed number i will do another one and i need you to try home let's go to question five in a question five thirteen or twenty okay question five 13 over 20. i need this to be written as a mixed number or uh write it as a fraction no question five sorry right as decimal they change here this the question now it is right as decimal and it is 13 over 20. i need this to be written as decimal what is the meaning of decimal i mean i mean the number down should be 10 100 1000 i have here down 20 i need it to be 10 100 or 1000 can i make the 2010 no because it's smaller but i will try to do it 100 by what can you write the 20 in another way instead of 20 and you can write it 100 yes by multiply by what 20 multiply by what by 5 if you multiply 20 by 5 you will get 100 and as i did down by 5 i will do the upper part of by 5. 13 by 5 15 so this is my number okay i change it write it as decimal it is 65 over 100 now this is a fraction how can i write it as decimal do i have whole here no so it will be 0 then put the decimal then it will be 65 so i change from fraction to decimal you need to uh memorize by heart that to make the 5 10 you need to multiply by 2 to make the 20 100 you need to multiply by five if you have 25 you need to multiply it by what by four to make it 100 if you have 50 you need to multiply it by 2 to make it 100 if i have uh what memorize this and it will be easy for you so the 20 i need to change it to 100 multiply by 5 up and down okay so my number become up 65 over 100 if you write it as a decimal it is 0.65 i hope you understand please watch the video more than one i will give you homework i need you to try and solve from this page okay until we meet tomorrow bye", "fpGjjMzjiZc": "hello everyone it's your boy DBZ 3 coming at you with another update from this vivid grow grow max Auto flower growing super soil man these plants are doing pretty good look at the little sprouts they're in day seven today they just got a watering and today's watering they got plain water just a couple pails of plain filter water gave them enough water to they had a little bit of runoff in their saucers that helps to parts one and make sure the bottom of pots is moist enough so the roof can help stretch down there and they don't run into a dry soil and also it helps when the water evaporates get a little moisture and air since their sprouts they need a little bit of moisture more humidity than normal so far so far so good man I just like I said they're de7 not really much to watch or do right now the lights really impressive I haven't had to move it or anything yet it runs super cool I've been I took a oh I also took this frog out I just took that out right now I'm gonna take that out set it to the side and that way I have time to put the net on it and put it to the side for when these plants are ready to be in the fog that won't be for a while but yeah the light I haven't had to lower in any I've been thinking about lowering it but I was waiting to see if the plants would stretch at all but like I said they're barely in day seven so right now they're not really doing much above ground they're really just building a root system below since they're in such big pots a lot of people are talking about that I should have started them you know Solo cups but since these are Otto flowers sometimes starting them in smaller pots can be a hindrance because a root structure I want the roots to as big and as fast as they can and once the roots hit the wall they'll start growing in different areas but usually a root structure on an auto 3 gallon pot is big enough for me that will least in my experience well that's about it for now if you guys have any questions comments or want to know anything about my grow who me up in the comments section below and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can he's [Music]", "g1uGf8pUMdk": "hi my name is Maria and I'm a mathematician and today I'm going to talk to you about fluid ounces the tablespoons conversion so the ratio between fluid ounces and tablespoons is 1/2 to 1 fluid ounce equals two tablespoons so if we wanted to do a conversion and let's say we were given three fluid ounces we're going to set up a proportion so we know that for every one fluid ounce there are two tablespoons I'm going to set up a proportion if I have three fluid ounces I'm going to make sure that they're matched up ounces ounces tablespoons tablespoons so I'm going to put my three in the numerator with my other ounces and I don't know how many tablespoons because that's what I'm trying to convert to so I'm going to put a variable there now I have a proportion that I'm going to solve by cross-multiplying so I'm doing x times 1 equals X bring down my equal sign 2 times 3 equals 6 so in 3 fluid ounces there are six tablespoons so the way to do fluid ounce to tablespoon conversion is by setting up the ratio one to two one fluid ounce for every two tablespoons and then creating a proportion and solving it", "c8Yj6ilkXh8": "now what if you're given two and 1/8 pound equals how many ounces now you know that and 1 pound they're going to be 16 ounces right so go ahead and figure out the relationship from going to pounds 2 ounces go ahead and figure out what's relation to 1 into T with the x 16 yes so take a number of pounds that you're given two and 1/8 right and you're going to multiply that by a team all right let's do that two and 1/8 times 16 now let's rearrange estill that way it's a little bit more eye appealing so 16 will be re-written as 2 - number one right and um okay and two and 1/8 would be rewritten and improper fraction so the easier 12 plus so 2 times 8 right plus 1/2 times 8 15 16 plus 1 is 17 over 8 times 16 over 1 right um go ahead and see if you have any comment right with 1588 they have a greatest common factor of 8 so divide both by 8 8 divided by 8 is 108 yes 16 divided by 8 is 2 17 times 2 is 34 1 times 1 is 1 34 divided by 1 2 3 4 so what 2 and 1/8 ounce equals 34 ounces", "gN9PYfZ5r8E": "so just in case you don't know already real pong hue is the ash of a special type of grass called the pong pong grass and when you add this special ash to wheat dough it makes the dough stretch better and makes the noodles taste better most hand-pulled noodle chefs will rely on panghui to quickly produce good-tasting hand-pulled noodles for their restaurant but the thing is as chinese cooking demystified pointed out well basically all lamian chops use this brand of bagpung way this stuff isn't actually the ash of the halogeetan arachnoidias plant either see given how much lanzhou lamiana has consumed in china you could imagine that there just wasn't enough ash to go around so in 1989 researchers at the lanzhou university in gansu developed this stuff a mix of additives that is the pung hue used throughout china today and that sums up the situation really well very few noodle masters actually use the authentic ash instead they will use a replacement that functions the same as the ash but actually is just a mix of different compounds now what can be considered a good replacement for pung hoi a good punghoy replacement when added to wheat dough needs to do two things one it needs to make the dough stretch better and two it needs to make the cooked noodles strong and chewy and that's it as long as a punghoy replacement does these two things then it is a successful pong hue replacement no matter what it's actually made of as you may have guessed there are many possible pong way replacements out there that you can use but and here's the big problem all these replacements have some issue or another let me show you the most commonly used penguin replacement is a mix of salt sodium carbonate sodium tri-poly tripolyphosphate and sodium metabisulfite in case you don't know the salt sodium carbonate and sodium metabisulfite help with the dose stretch the salt and alkali make the dough stretch evenly and alkali also helps a bit with the needle texture and then the sodium metabisulfite is actually the dough relaxer that makes the dough stretchy sodium tri-poly phosphate on the other hand makes the cooked noodles strong and chewy although this pungaway replacement achieves both of the functional goals of panghui it has a wide plethora of other issues first these chemicals are not healthy to ingest and they are a huge skin irritant its effect is only temporary and on top of that it is not available outside of china you can also make this punghoy replacement at home by mixing the four chemicals together yourself but it is very difficult to obtain these chemicals and it is also dangerous to work with these chemicals for restaurant production given that you have a good relationship with the punghoy manufacturer in china it should be decent except for the fact that it's a skin irritant so wear gloves or something but for most people i mean it's impossible to even get a hold of this and of course there's the issue of serving phosphates and sulfites which are not very healthy to your customers in your restaurant without declaring them this is not the only commercial pong hoi replacement though a different brand known as lanjo nirolami and wang uses different substances to achieve the same effect most people have never heard of this brand before so let me explain a bit about how it works this panghui replacement contains xanthan gum calcium sterile lactolate amylase xylenase and lipase now all these ingredients except for lipase function to improve the texture of the cooked noodles lip base is kind of a weird addition and i think it just helps to eliminate oil from the dough so that it doesn't get in the way of gluten now this is not ideal because although we do have things that improve the texture of the cooked noodles we have nothing to actually make the dough stretchy like a dough relaxer but this is actually not really that much of an issue because i think what you're supposed to do is you're just supposed to use a high hydration dough to make the dose stretch and that will work just fine this brand in my opinion is one step above the first punghoy replacement i mentioned because it uses completely safe chemicals look them up they are all completely safe very natural and are not skin irritants however one problem with this brand is still that it's really hard for people outside of china to buy it or if you want to buy the components and mix them together yourself it's hard to find all these except xanthan gum how could i ever find calcium sterile lactoly or amylase at my grocery store i also have never tried out this brand myself and i'm sure there are other issues that i'm not aware of another punghway replacement is nutritional yeast introduced by tim chin from series eats if you haven't seen his original hand pulled noodle tutorial you should definitely check it out after this video ends and it will be linked in the description tim chin is an absolute genius and his research into dough relaxers changed hand pulled noodles forever now what makes nutritional yeast so great although nutritional yeast is not a commercially produced punghoi replacement nutritional yeast does contain a natural dough relaxer called glutathione and that's why it's viable in hand pulled noodles and also why i made an entire video about the subject now the real factor that made nutritional yeast a big deal is because nutritional yeast is actually commonly available you can just go to any grocery store and find nutritional yeast it's also healthy natural safe and definitely not a skin irritant at all however it is not a complete panghui replacement because there's nothing that makes the noodles strong and chewy many people who use nutritional yeast find themselves with very weak or soggy noodles it is possible to make good noodles with nutritional yeast but it takes a lot of practice nutritional yeast also imparts a weird cheesy flavor on the noodles but this is not the biggest issue be sure to watch my video about nutritional yeast to learn more about it it will be linked down in the description now there's also one more option which is to just use flour water and salt and nothing else many people say that this is impossible but that's not true of course many people have done this including myself it just requires more skill to make hand pulled noodles with just flour salt and water so that's where we are today i am very unsatisfied with all of these options an ideal pung-hoi substitute in my opinion has to meet four requirements it has to make the dough stretchy of course it has to make the noodles strong and chewy of course but it also has to be safe natural and harmless and it has to be commonly available so that you can make handled noodles at home this is a tall order but i have found a perfect solution so keep watching this video so i've tested and experimented with 20 to 30 potential new punk way substitutes but one of them really stood out to me as the perfect solution this was a simple combination of glutathione xanthan gum and salt now we've never talked about xanthan gum before so let me give you a rundown of what it does in hand pulled noodles now first is a hundred percent safe especially in the quantities we're going to be using the main function of xanthan gum is to provide strength and chew to the noodles now lots of other things also strengthen noodles but xanthan gum is one of the very few that actually does so with little to no downsides sodium tripolyphosphate strengthens noodles but it is unhealthy and hard to get salt and alkalize also strengthen noodles but the problem with those is that you can only add a very small amount of salt or alkalis otherwise they will make the dough stiff and hard to work with and not stretchy xanthan gum on the other hand can be found at many grocery stores as well as online and it does not make the dough stiffer or anything like that now there is one very very small downside let's run the side by side comparison so here's two identical dose except the one on the left has xanthan gum you can see that during the stretch and fold stage the two doughs are practically identical and that just shows how xanthan gum does not make the dough stiffer or anything now i've loaded these doughs up with way more nutritional yeast and way more water than usual to make sure the cooked noodles are soggy but watch as i put the noodles into the pot only one of the batches is soggy and breaking and the other is still strong can you guess which one that is yup the batch with xanthan gum just look at the side by side comparison and see for yourself which you would rather be eating [Music] now remember i said there was one tiny tiny downside to xanthan gum well it's that it makes the noodles less even see how there's a super thick one there i promise i tried my best to do the same technique for both those but the xanthan gum batch was definitely less even but i say that this is only a small problem because it is easily fixed by adding just a bit more salt using xanthan gum in moderation and obviously pulling the noodles with good technique even the batch of noodles with xanthan gum that i used in this very experiment could be easily fixed when i added just a modest amount of salt and i was once again able to get perfectly even noodles even though there is xanthan gum in this dough and remember i added way too much water and nutritional yeast than you should ever use in this test if you actually remove the unnecessary water and no relaxer and also use xanthan gum you can get noodles that are just perfect chewy strong that rival those from most hand-pulled noodle restaurants i've ever been to now i know that some of you may be saying that xanthan gum can't possibly make for authentic hand-pulled noodles but i think zanthinko makes perfectly authentic hampled noodles first of all the brand of punghoy i introduced earlier uses xanthan gum so if they can use it why can't i second of all there is a lot of documentation about using hydrocolloids in chinese noodles and you can just read this article which i'll link to in the description to learn more about it it's really fascinating but that's just xanthan gum there's two other ingredients in my perspective punghoy replacement which are glutathione and salt now glutathione as i said before is a dough relaxer or reducer and thus its job is to make the dough stretchy and extensible what if you don't have access to glutathione powder no worries at all just use nutritional yeast which itself contains glutathione obviously if you're using nutritional yeast you will want to use different proportions so that the total amount of glutathione is unchanged and lastly salt i said before is to help the dough stretch evenly as well as to dilute the other ingredients now to use my new punghoy no new techniques or steps are required start by mixing together flour water and salt rest the dough for a couple hours then add doses of pung hoi substitute into the dough along with water over and over until the dough stretches properly and then bam we have hand pulled noodles this is just the same procedure that i have been talking about for months and the only difference is that every time you add water you also add a bit of the punghoy substitute as well and using this pungboy substitute will make the process easier and faster and the needles will have a better texture and of course if you find proportions that you like there are no consequences to just mixing this punghoy substitute straight into the flour at the very beginning before you add water how much salt xanthan gum and glutathione should we use well i like to use 74 salt 24 xanthine gum and 2 glutathione glutathione percentage is low because doe relaxers should only be used in very low concentrations xanthan gum should be between 20 to 40 percent because if it is too low it will have a negligible effect and if too high it will start to make the noodles uneven as i was saying earlier and there will not be enough salt to control that unevenness to make the punk white substitute first crush up 74 grams of salt to crush it up efficiently you'll want to dilute the salt with water just barely enough to completely dilute the salt and then heat it for a long time to evaporate the water once dried use a mortar and pestle to crush up the salt and the salt will fall apart into powder once the salt is crushed add to it 24 grams of xanthan gum and 2 grams of glutathione some scales have trouble weighing small amounts so you may want to do a 2x or 4x batch to increase accuracy mix very very thoroughly make sure to smash the clumps of glutathione because glutathione tends to clump together and you want that distributed as evenly as possible once those are all mixed together transfer it to an airtight jar and you will have yourself pong hue that is all ready to go now if you're using nutritional yeast you'll want to use different proportions of course something like 88 nutritional yeast 3 xanthan gum and 9 salt should do fine just remember if your nutritional yeast comes in flakes you'll want to crush that up into powder before you mix it in with the other ingredients now let's talk about alternatives is using glutathione xanthan gum and salt the only solution no as i mentioned earlier i've tried over 20 different pung hoi substitutes and there are lots more i haven't tried the two places where we can kind of mix and match are with the dough relaxer and the noodle texture improver with the dough relaxer you can switch glutathione out for other dough relaxers such as sodium metabisulfite cysteine or even proteas however the effect should be roughly the same across the board i strongly prefer glutathione or nutritional yeast however because they are the most healthy options and they are also relatively available with the noodle texture improver there are also a wide plethora of options first i want to mention that adding an egg has a similar effect to adding xanthan gum however i do not care for the noodle texture that egg produces and using an egg is also not as flexible as xanthan gum on the plus side though everyone owns eggs so you can feel free to give that a try another solution is using completely safe noodle enhancers such as calcium sterile lactolate or glycerol monastery or monoglycerides or xylenase but frankly i'm not about to order all of these obscure substances from all the dark corners of the internet and try them all out maybe one of you has access to some of these and can make an even better punghoy substitute another option is you can just go straight into the some of the potentially less safe noodle improvers such as sodium tripolyphosphate or sodium pyrophosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate or sodium dihydrogen phosphate propylene glycol algae and the list goes on and on but remember the requirements it has to make the dough stretchy it has to make the noodles strong it has to be safe natural and harmless and it also has to be commonly available at least for an effective easy and available punk way those are the requirements that make sense to me these requirements actually eliminate a lot of the possibilities which makes this quite a hard problem but now you know my solution glutathione or nutritional yeast plus xanthan gum plus salt using this punghoi substitute has allowed me to create some of the best hand pulled noodles i've ever made in my life and i never have to worry about the dough not stretching or the noodles not tasting good or not being safe or anything i am satisfied a few final thoughts the name i'm going to use for my pung hoi replacement is pong hoi x for both the nutritional yeast version and the glutathione version my initial thought was that x stands for xanthan gum but in chinese this would probably translate to pong hui yi because yi is the only character that looks like x and also can sometimes mean stability why stability i honestly think this is basically the ultimate solution to making hand pulled noodles at home pong hoi x is just as easy and effective as the pung hoi in the blue packet and it's way more healthy in everything honestly even restaurants should use this because the way that the xanthan gum strength complements the gluten's chew tastes so similar to how the real pung-hoi would strengthen the noodles but there's no aftertaste of rotten eggs that you would get with sodium bisulfite now before the video ends i just want to mention one more thing which is that the only functional flaw that i see with pung hoi x is that it doesn't quite dissolve in water because xanthan gum doesn't dissolve in water you can still do the same routine where you dilute the phoenix water and add the water but there's always bits of xanthan gum floating around so you may want to add it similar to how you would add nutritional yeast which is adding it dry and then adding water separately now the cleanest way is to just add it into the flour dry of course but sometimes your ratio is just a bit off and you just need to add more punk way to the dough if it weren't for this one tiny thing of not dissolving it would just be so much better and one more thing is for those of you who are ambitious obviously feel free to play around with the ratios of the ingredients i think that in six months i myself might even be using a slightly different ratio so we'll see what happens anyway thanks for watching check out my video about nutritional yeast if you haven't already and i'll see you in the next video", "tcyR4w9d7h4": "this is calculator question number 26 from the March 2019 SAT exam College Board's asked a ratio question about mixing blue and yellow paint to get green and the question is if Anita uses two ounces of blue - three ounces of yellow in her first batch that she wants the same ratio in the second batch with five ounces of blue how much yellow I'm going to call that amount X and choice a would be five ounces the question is is 2/3 equal to 5 over 5 and clearly that's not Tribune as 5 over 5 is 1 and 2/3 it's less so choice a is wrong what about choice B is 2/3 equal to 3 ounces more than the amount of yellow in the first batch batch so still 5 blue but we had 3 yellow and now we're going to have 3 more so 3 plus 3 is 6 and 2/3 is not equal to 5 over 6 so that is not the same ratio of blue and yellow choice B is wrong how much waste see 1.5 times the amount of yellow in the first batch that'd be 2 over 3 equals 5 over the amount of yellow in the first batch was 3 3 times 1.5 is 4.5 but two fifths less than 1/5 over 4.5 is more than ones those cannot be equal I'm hoping the last choice will work 2 over 3 - blue over 300 in the first batch we want the same ratio and we have 5 over 1 quick 5 times 5 1.5 times the amount of fluids the batch 5 over 5 is 1 the question is is 2/3 equal to 1 over 1.5 I can verify down on my calculator or I can multiply by 2 over 2 10 2 or 3 equals 1 times 2 is 2 1.5 times 2 is 3 so yes that works choice D would be the correct answer call its warned often asks or ACO questions so make

welcome to kids in the kitchen today we're going to make festive scalloped corn casserole so this is something that we serve at the holidays at our house such as thanksgiving or christmas and i thought i would share it with you today so some of the ingredients are going to be sour cream a small muffin mix corn muffin a can of cream corn and a can of whole corn melted butter i have to melt it and three eggs and last a third of a cup of green onion so i'll bring you closer and you can see me mix it up and work right with me i'll see in a minute all right to start we're going to put three eggs in our mixing bowl so let's crack them and put them in one two three okay we're going to whisk those up this tool is called a whisk and water turns for eggs of your milk mixing mouth or something like that in it you might use a whisk to make everything blend very very well okay so those are whisk so i'm gonna set that on the side we're gonna add a third of a cup of green onion and it says with the tops so we might not use all of this but we'll use some of it and i have my third of a cup right here put them in i think it's going to take around two green onions and i do just little slices you can do it any way you want in case i don't need all the onion i'll go up here the green adds a nice little color to it a little bit more now if you don't like onion or you don't like a lot of onion you could always put less maybe you want to add some green pepper or something else to it i think that'll do it yep so we had about this much left not too much so we'll put that in and let's put this on the side so this is a third of a cup of green onion we'll give that a little stir and next we're going to add our cream corn it's just a regular can of cream corn i like to use a spatula to make sure i get everything out of the can just makes it a little bit easier but maybe you want to use a spoon and that would work too and then i'm going to add a can of just regular corn um you also instead of adding a regular can of corn sometimes i've also used frozen corn that i thawed and this is about two cups so i would just add two cups of regular cork but i'm using can today because that's what i have on hand give a little stir [Music] okay now i'm going to add my my package of i'm just using a kifi a jiffy corn muffin mix you can use whatever brand this is 8.5 ounces there might be a bit of a variation out there but i've always used just this brand but i'm sure any of them will work so i'm going to dump that in give it a little stir now while you're mixing this up you might want us to preheat your oven to 350 degrees because that's what we're going to bake it at we're going to bake this at 350 degrees for 35 to 40 minutes or it depends until the edges are brown okay now we have that then we're going to put in a cup of sour cream move this out of the way and i have a cup measuring cup this is one cup so i'm just gonna scoop it in now just you know i've also made this with yogurt half yogurt all yogurt and that's worked just fine too but today because i have sour cream in the house i'm using sour cream there we go one cup put it in now i like to use a spatula again so i can get everything out one of my favorite utensils in the kitchen are little bitty spatulas all right scoop this off all right and put the cover back on this and after i mix this in i melted my two tablespoons of butter remember when you get out a stick of butter you can look on the side and there are lines each stick of butter has eight tablespoons in it you need two tablespoons so i cut off two tablespoons put it in a little dish and put it in the microwave oh for 30 seconds so this is my two tablespoons of melted butter so i'm gonna dump that in again i'm gonna use my little spatula finish mixing it see mix this up very very well all righty so now we're going to put this in an 8x8 pan and before i do that i'm going to spray it i'm not going to today but you can also add an eighth of a teaspoon of crushed red pepper if you want to if you want it to be a little bit more spicy i'm not going to do that because my family doesn't like it quite so spicy but it's you can if you want to so i'm going to spray my pan with some oil spray and then i'm going to just dump it in just like this this makes a great side dish for the holidays and you could serve it with chicken you could ham whatever you like i'm gonna use my spatula again my scraper it's just a mix and big kind of dish all right okay it's all mixed up i'm gonna put it in the oven and i'll see you back here in 30 to 40 minutes welcome back our festive scalp corn casserole is baked doesn't it look nice what a good job you did all right let's cut it and see how it looks i think i'll use a spatula there look in the inside it's still hot but it is finished doesn't that look good i hope you'll make this for your holiday thanks for joining me today i hope you have a nice holiday i hope you make something you like

What do we all have in common? No matter what corner of the world you live in You need food, water, shelter and money. Half of every transaction involves money in exchange for goods or services. Stocks, a loaf of bread illegal drugs you gotta pay for it. We spend much of our lives chasing money to make a living and accomplish our dreams. But it's also an instrument of destruction some might say evil driving criminals to lie, steal and even murder. The existing banking system extracts enormous value from society and it is parasitic in nature. Money is a catalyst for the worst \nand the best of human endeavor. before civilization We created currency. Fuel for wars The path to power Champion and enemy of innovation Money is so integral to our society\nand our global economy, That it's true nature remains a mystery to most. This is the story of money. Perhaps the end of money as we know it. No matter how fat your bank account, or how thin your wallet, To us, It's all cold hard cash. There are some who want to kill it, get rid of it Burn your Dollars, your Euros, your Yen and transform every penny you have\ninto ones and zeros digital currency Entrusted to the web and computers \nspread across the planet Magic internet money It's called cryptocurrency Bitcoin Invented in secret It was a gift to the world It's not just the currency, \nbut it's actually programmable money A potential curse on bankers I mean, there's nothing that the big banks \nor politicians can do to stop it. Breaking every government's grip on money supply What the internet did for information, Bitcoin is doing for money. - Could it be the new gold ? - No, you have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. Regulators, the Federal Reserve, the banking system, least to understand,\nthis is a thing that they have to take seriously. This is going to change the economic culture. Bitcoin could be a micro economic miracle worker, and it could be a macro economic wrecking ball. Is Bitcoin the currency of the future ? A godsend for criminals ? Or a recipe for financial disaster ? If you trust your money just as it is, we have a little story to share. Once upon a time there was a big party, with everyone standing around the punch bowl, drunk ! Politicians credited the strong economy to their wise decisions. Businesses jumped into new profitable markets,\nignoring risk. In fact, the experts said there was no risk. Then, troubling market data from minor countries spooked the markets. Rumors spread. More bad news rattled housing prices at the heart of the financial world. A major bank went insolvent. investors and businesses made a run \non the other banks, demanding their cash deposits. The largest financial Institutions in the center of the modern world were frozen. Assets were seized. Banks foreclosed. A credit crunch threatened the entire world economy. And then, finally the government stepped in. The largest bank bailout ever Swift action by the head of state had saved the day. Remember that ? No, you don't. It happened 2,000 years ago. Rome, 33 AD Ground zero for the first recorded liquidity crisis and government bailout in history. The largest empire the world had ever seen was brought to it's knees by a banking disaster. Emperor Tiberius used money from \nthe National Treasury to bail out the country's troubled banks and companies. History may not repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes ... ... badly. People in power and their money have always been at the very center of it. The story of money is as old as civilization itself. When we lived in small tribes, keeping track of debt was easy. You owed somebody a load of firewood. A neighbor owed you a piece of meat. Credits and debits were kept in your head. A mental ledger Currency is a language that allows us to express transactional value between people. It's a technology that's older than the wheel. It's as old as fire. When humans wanted to trade outside \ntheir tribe or village, they needed something everyone could agree had value. Something scalable. Enter commodity monies There were many kinds but each had to embody the same five characteristics. A commodity money is relatively scarce, Easily recognizable, Can be cut into smaller pieces, You can substitute one piece for another of equal value. and you can carry it around without too much trouble. In ancient Rome, it was salt. The Aztecs used cacao beans, It was whale teeth on Fiji, Yak dung in Tibet, Shells in Africa and China, Grains, metal, ivory, rare stones, leather, fish If it had the five characteristics of commodity money, someone probably used it as currency. And then you ask What value do these currencies have ? If you go into a primary school, you'll see children exchanging rubber bands and Tamagotchi and Pokemon cards and baseball cards, and sweets and candy, and any other form of currency. People invent currency when \nthey have no other currency, and now they're going to invent digital currencies. But commodities that aren't durable, are a lousy store of value. A bad cacao crop, or a huge new salt discovery can throw your currency and economy into turmoil. A more stable system was needed. About 2,500 years ago the first metal coins were minted in China, and in what is now Turkey. These coins shared the same five characteristics with commodity money. But were also very durable. In some cases coins are the only thing \nleft of entire civilizations. Money does not originate with goverments. Money arises naturally as markets are began to develop and as people with the division of labor, realized that if I have eggs, and you have a cow We may need some medium of exchange in order for you to buy my eggs,\nand for me to buy your cow. Coins were an objective and universal unit of account and they allowed people to \nbuy and sell goods over vast regions. The market economy was born. Coins worked. But only if people trusted that the king or Emperor who issued them wasn't cheating on the metal content. Using coins also meant that an authority now controlled \nthe supply of your currency. Money and political power were inextricably linked. Centralized. Minting coins in a steady and predictable manner, allowed economic growth and stability. The Wu Zhu coin in China retained \nit's value for 500 years. In Constantinople the Solidus lasted for 700 years. But in those times the coins didn't have the the milled ... This sort of milled edge. They were flat. And what used to happen was as coins were passing from people to people people would cut little bits off. And in fact some of the taxation \nthat the Kings would do they would actually be taking 1/8 of the coin off. Taxes built castles. and financed military campaigns. Expensive hobbies ! Soon royal mints were substituting\n cheaper metals for silver and gold. This is called \"debasement\" and Europe's Kings, made a habit of it. The currency of France was debased every 20 months for 200 years ! If no one can trust the gold or silver \ncontent of your coins, how can you trade with other countries? International merchants found a solution. They recognized that one person's debt has value. It can be traded or transferred. When those IOUs came from reputable sources, they could be used as a form of money. Paper money. This money was not based on \nhard commodities or metal, but instead on someone's promise to pay. Merchants families like the Medici \nin 15th century Florence acted as clearing houses for these IOUs. it worked like this : An English trader ordered a shipment of Italian cloth from the Medici for 100 gold coins. His promise to pay the Medici was put on paper. Meanwhile, the Medici owed 100 gold coins to another trading partner for delivery of wine from France. The parties didn't go to the expense of transporting and exchanging gold coins. Instead, the paper was transferred. Everyone agreed that the paper had value : \"100 gold coins\" But only because everyone trusted the Medici as solvent middlemen. They had created a paper money machine Within a few generations, they rose from low crime to high finance. Their great wealth helped fuel the Italian Renaissance, and elevated the family to levels of\nenormous political power. The power to marry into royal families, and get elected as popes. The ties binding money to power, politics and influence now ran through church and state. Merchants had proven that creating paper currency could be wildly profitable. Goldsmiths wanted in on the action. Imagine it like this : if the Goldsmith had seen over a period of time that some of the coins he was storing for people, were gathering dust. The people who owned them, \ndon't need them right now. So what if I go and lend them out into the community, and I charge them interest on this loan ? So he starts out lending some of these \ngold coins and then later, he realizes actually people \ndon't even want the gold coins They just want the piece of paper, that says the gold coins are in the bank \nand with the goldsmith. So I can now make a loan with these pieces of paper. And whatever I write on a piece of paper, as long as people trust me, they'll trust the paper. And effectively the Goldsmiths \nand the early day bankers they had literally acquired the power to print money. More and more private paper money \nfrom merchants and banks, circulated and began to rival the crown's coins. The power inherent in controlling and issuing money, began slipping away from the rulers. They couldn't tax or debase this new kind of money. But they had bigger ambitions than ever with trading posts, colonies, and empires that now stretched across the globe. For centuries European countries would take turns building massive fleets and waging war on each other to rule the world. Government wanted to take the people's money in order to finance its wars. That's essentially the history of money. Money and warfare go together. War is expensive. One year's income taxes simply aren't enough. Kings and queens had to borrow money\nagainst future taxes. They needed a groundbreaking financial innovation. Government bonds The loans came from rich \nmerchant families and Goldsmiths who by now had become \npowerful financiers and bankers. Sovereign debt and deficit spending had been born. In 1694, The Bank of England was established to fund a war against France. England central bank was privately owned and granted the monopoly to issue banknotes. Paper that could be redeemed \nfor an equal amount of gold from the government coffers. The central bank soon also managed \nthe entire debt of the crown. Money has been a tool of sovereignty for centuries. Being able to issue currency, gave you the power but it also gave the value to that monetary supply, by backing it with a force of state. With essentially the debt of the state. When the US won independence from Britain, the first article of the new constitution gave Congress the exclusive right to coin money. This currencies value was tied to \ngold in government vaults. From 1781 until the panic of 1907, The financial system of the US \nwas an economic petri dish ; Brief central banks, State banks, private banks, private currency, government currency, depressions, strong growth, recessions, regular boom and bust cycles. The long term, as far as capitalists concern, people want predictability, people want stability. From the back of that they can plan. That's very hard to plan in the long term, when there's such a level of volatility. In 1913, bankers and politicians decided that it was in the country's best interest and theirs, to have a permanent central bank. They created the Federal Reserve. Among it's jobs : Expand or contract the supply of a\nsingle national currency The Federal Reserve Note The dollar was tied to gold, and strategic control of it\nwould avoid booms that lead to busts. At least that was the plan. Then came 1929. The Great Depression would have a profound effect on monetary policy Worldwide \"I Shall ask the Congress for \nthe one remaining instrument ...\" \"... to meet the crisis\" \"Broad executive power\" Soon the Fed had printed \nnearly all the money it legally could to pump life back into the economy. It needed gold to fire up the mint. So in 1933 President Roosevelt issued a \ncontroversial executive order. Forcing all US citizens to sell their gold to \nthe Federal Reserve at a fixed price, Or go to prison. The Fed offered far more cash to foreign\n governments for their gold. Many jumped at the offer. Gold flowed in, and dollars spread across the globe. World War 2 devastated nearly every major economy. Except the United States. The military and industrial juggernaut emerged as THE global financial superpower. The Dollar had become the world's most stable and trusted currency. Other countries pegged their currency to the Dollar. Which could still be redeemed for gold. In fact the US owned more than half of the world's gold reserves. In the next few decades more Dollars \nflowed to foreign countries. Governments began debasing their coins\n with cheaper metals, and printing more of their own currency \nthan they had in gold. The bond between precious metals and paper currency was cracking. This is a 1966 50-cent piece. It was the last coin in regular circulation in Australia to contain silver. And it contains 80 percent silver. So in 1966 this was 50 cents. Nowadays, It's 8 Dollars, roughly, in silver alone ! By 1966 foreign nations had had enough of the US Collecting gold and printing cash. And they had more value in Dollars than the US had bullion in its vaults. They demanded gold in return for their paper Dollars. Arguments about the value of the Dollar\nversus their currency ensued. In 1971 President Nixon settled the matter. He severed United States currency\nfrom the gold standard. \"I have directed secretary Connally to suspend temporarily ...\" \"... the convertibility of the Dollar into gold or other reserve assets ...\" \"... Except in amounts and conditions determined ...\" \"... to be in the interest of monetary stability ...\" \"... and in the best interest of the United States.\" Never again could anyone \nlegally demand US government gold in exchange for paper Dollars. For better or worse the Dollar was now backed solely by the Full Faith and Credit of the \nUnited States government. The wealthiest nation the world had ever known would bet its future on a single word : \" Trust \" People have this mythology of money that is based on very little fact. And one of the nice things about Bitcoin is that it forces people to start to ask questions about the fundamentals of money. Bitcoin is an attempt to adopt the advanced computerized system that we have, the internet to resurrecting what money used to be all about. I think our Dollar policies, our monetary policies our fiscal policies, have absolutely created a nation of debtors. Not just personal debt, not just corporate debt,\nbut government debt, and you have to look at those all together \nas one big thing. What is the wealth of the nation? Well, the wealth of the nation is a gigantic \nhole of money that we owe to the rest of the world That is never going to be paid back. Today the United States pays more than 400 billion Dollars in interest to its creditors every year. When a government spends more money \nthan it collects in taxes, it simply borrows more. Or it creates more. At one time every piece of paper money \nwas backed by gold. Remember ! For every $20 bill there was $20 worth of gold in the government vault. Not anymore. Today governments create currency by first \ncreating bonds or Treasury bills. These bonds are sold in the market. Generating funds for the government that issued them. Large banks buy US bonds to flip them. Selling them to the Federal Reserve at a profit. This is the magic money machine. You see, the Fed is America's central bank, but it doesn't have any money. No cash on its balance sheets. When a bank buys a bond and\ntakes it to the Federal Reserve the Fed simply says :\n\" Thank you Mr. Banker !\" \" Here's the principal and some profit. \" New money isn't exchanged. It simply appears on the bank's accounts. Magic ! For 100 years and counting, the precise mechanisms of these bond purchases have remained a secret. Here's where it gets really interesting ! The Federal Reserve is not a government agency. It's a private entity and its shareholders are banks Which earn a dividend. \nAs much as 80 billion dollars per year total are paid out to some of the very same banks that sell the government debt to the Fed. Which banks ? Don't even bother asking ! \nThat's also a secret. In other words the magic money machine \nanswers to no one. The Fed also sets the bar for how much interest you pay for a car, home, or business loan. The Federal Reserve has been given the impossible task of trying to run the credit and monetary system as though we are the Soviet Union. It's the central planner for the key aspect \nof Capitalism, which is how money and credit is allocated. The Federal Reserve unbalance \ndoes not help the economy, unbalance hurts the economy. And it's bound to make mistakes. Even with the best of intentions. The Fed is also supposed to boost \nemployment with low interest rates. Encouraging people and businesses \nto buy more goods and services. Governments getting involved in money is a good thing and it's also a bad thing. It's a good thing because money is the arteries of the economy, the blood supply of the economy. Markets are subject to\nbouts of euphoria and despair. And it makes sense for governments to \nback currency and manipulate it. Moving the money supply up and down\nis the most powerful way to sedate that boom and bust cycle. Manipulating the supply of money has\nshort-term and long-term consequences. Central Bank's aim to create new money carefully, strategically, and very very slowly. Releasing more money into the economy Causes prices to rise.\nIdeally by two percent every year. That's supposed to foster economic growth. But 2% inflation means the buying power of \none cash dollar in your pocket today will be 98 cents next year. and less nearly every year to come. Since 1913 when the Federal Reserve took over \nthe United States Dollar, we've seen that the United Sates Dollar \nhas decreased in value 98% Inflation is a far higher tax. Because on your income you pay it just once. If inflation is 2% you're paying a 2% tax \non your net worth every single year your net worth held in currency. So what does that mean? If you earned a Dollar in 1913, you could buy 16 loaves of bread. Today a Dollar barely buys you one. That's not a quaint notion of \nhow cheap things used to be. It's proof that the value of your cash\nis slowly withering away. That one Dollar invested at 2% in 1913 would now be worth $ 7.24 more than %600 return versus a near total loss. The US Dollar has gone from being worth $1 to now being worth about 4 cents. So that's, you know, 96% of its original value. And it's a direct result of government control. Governments, don't create money from thin air all alone. You play a key role in the magic money machine. It's not really the central banks that are the problem. I mean, they're part of the problem. But the real problem is that\nwe've given the power to create money, to the same banks that caused the financial crisis. We put our paychecks and savings into a bank account, and draw from it as we need it. The banks are custodians of our money, \nright? Wrong ! It is now the property of the bank\non their balance sheets. They can do just about anything they want with it. For example create new money. Here's how : Your bank account shows $100 but the bank only holds $3 and loans $97 to Bob to buy something. In the bank's computers, you \nstill have $100 in your account. But Bob now has $97 of \nnew virtual money in his account. Just digits on a computer screen. There's no cash, no gold, or anything else backing up \nthe new numbers in Bob's account. Just his promise to pay it back. This is new money created as \"debt\". When those $97 are spent, say in a shop, the shop owner deposits into another bank. And it is lent out again and again and again. And each of these people\nhave numbers in their accounts, showing that they own this money. So your original $100 has multiplied. There are over $ 3,300 in the system. This process of loaning out far more money than a bank actually has as cash on hand is called \" Fractional Reserve Banking \". in the UK %97 of the money that exists is just numbers in a computer system, and those numbers are created by the banks. Banks earn untold billions in interest every year by creating and lending virtual money. What's more, banks don't even need your deposit to create new money. If they consider someone creditworthy for a loan, they can put new magic money into his or her account, and start charging interest. So reporters talk about Bitcoin\nas though it's the first digital currency. But actually we use digital currency every time you make a transaction through \ninternet banking or through your bank card. Actually, it's not even just digital currency. It's digital currency that is created by the banks. They essentially have nothing. In other words all new money is debt. This is the part of money creation\nthat isn't taught in economics class. Money in paychecks, bank accounts, 401ks that loan to Bob, credit card debt, your home loan, all began life as virtual money. Created by the banks. The entire system is based on trust. Trust in the bank's solvency. Trust in the debtors ability to repay their debt. If all bank customers demanded just 3% of their deposits, right now, in cash this run on the banks would reveal the truth. Almost none of that paper currency\nyou think is in your bank account exists ... ...  It never did ! Remember the drunken party ? Our financial crisis had everything to do\nwith virtual dollars Too many people with very little income borrowed a lot of money they could never repay. But the banks didn't care. They didn't have to. They quickly made and sold shaky loans to someone else for a profit. Selling bad loans was a good business. Until the whole thing blew up\nin a global financial crisis. The magic money machine destroyed\n30 million real jobs. The United States alone lost 16 trillion Dollars in household wealth. and the banks foreclosed on more than \n1 million homes. Selling subprime loans and betting they will fail, may not be sacred ... But it is lucrative ! As much as one quarter of our best and brightest, are being lured by the siren call of the money machine. Instead of science, engineering or medicine They chose a career playing with\nbetting with other people's money to get rich quick. Very rich And sometimes they take shortcuts. My ancestors in Greece talked about the corrupting influence of power. And nothing has changed in these 3,000 years. When you give control of massive amounts of money to a few individuals,\nthey will take advantage of that control. Banks today are factoring in fines and money laundering and all the rules that they break\ninto their cost of doing business. JPMorgan is today coming out and saying that Bitcoin is not a legitimate way of doing business. Banks today are tied in to a system that is completely rigged to basically harvest money from the entire global economy\nand pump it into the hands of very few. The existing banking system is cozy. it's captured the regulators, It extracts enormous value from society without delivering anything in return. and it is parasitic in nature. The banks play a very pivotal role in an economy If you look at any successful economy,\nIt has successful banks. There's a very close correlation with banking profits\nand the economy as a whole. In medieval Europe a banker who couldn't repay depositors,\nwas hanged. Today that same banker would get bailed out, paid bonuses and enjoy some tax benefits too. To date, no senior US banking executive has been charged for selling the bad loans that fueled the Great Recession. In December 2014, just 6 years after the last banking crisis brought the world to its knees, a congressman snuck a last-minute provision written by Citigroup into a crucial funding bill. The provision allows the largest US banks to once again make risky derivatives bets \nwith bank deposits But no need to worry if the banks implode again, lost deposits must be paid back ... ... By US taxpayers. Today's financial innovators package assets in ever more complex ways. Slicing, dicing, securitizing\nalways using someone else's money. They sell debt, transfer risks, leverage bets that's what they call \"innovation\" . When you're talking about financial innovation, Bitcoin certainly is a very good example of innovation. But there's also been other innovations that people a bit closer to the world of finance would Cite as good examples. an example of that would be the original swaps market. From there moving on to the credit default swap. It is an excellent example of financial innovation. But also if it's used incorrectly, it can create a lot of problems as we've just seen. History teaches that the most revolutionary and disruptive innovation, nearly always comes from the fringe, not from corporate cubicles. True innovators see the world differently. They see the big picture. Creating new products and entire systems \nthat lead to new industries. Steve Jobs called them \"the square cogs in round holes\" It's unsurprising that new innovations\nalways come from a niche group of early adopters. Because it is inherently very hard for many people to realize the benefits of new technologies. In 2011 most Bitcoin community people were Either people from the technology space the geeks and hackers, or people from the traditional financial industry. There were even some bankers and hedge fund traders using Bitcoin at that time as well. Which was really surprising to me. A radical new idea is often met with skepticism, ridicule, even hostility, from those who stand to lose the most \nfrom its success. Case in point : The automobile In the late 19th century, Karl Benz and others built the first cars. Contraptions that could threaten the stagecoach and railroad industries. These self-propelled vehicles or \"road trains\" would certainly scare horses,\ninjure people, and damage roads. Cars, the railroad barons said, were just too dangerous. And to protect us, they used their power\nto pass a law in 1865. It required every automobile in England to observe a 4 mile per hour speed limit and And to be operated by a crew of three : A driver, an engineer, and a flag man. This heroic flag man walked in front of the car to warn fellow citizens of the coming danger. The railroad tycoons, the lawmakers,\nthe self-appointed gatekeepers used regulations to stifle innovation. But they didn't invent the flagman. He's been around for a long time. For centuries very few could read. Books were copied by hand. The people in control, Political and religious leaders, wanted to keep it that way. and they greeted Johann Gutenberg's printing press with licensing laws, publishing bans, taxes. In some parts of the world\nprinting was a crime punishable by death. After all, they were just protecting us\nfrom dangerous ideas. Before the printing press, there were an estimated 30,000 books in all of Europe. 50 years later, there were 10 million. As Gutenberg's invention flourished, the dark ages withered.\nProgress couldn't be stopped. But the flagman never stops trying. His masters set him loose on each of these innovations, because they threaten someone's profits. Someone's control. But remember, this is a story about money. What if a technological innovation, allowed anyone in the world to be their own bank ? To create a currency free from taxes and banking fees. The US Constitution forbid citizens from printing or minting their own currency. Competing with or undercutting\nreliance on the US Dollar. In 1998 Bernard von NotHaus decided to test the resolve of the federal government. The Liberty dollar was available in gold,\nsilver, platinum and copper. It was available in three forms ; Both in specie, in other words gold and silver, in paper, as warehouse receipts,\nand in digital form. Obviously the government didn't like it. They arrested me and convicted me of counterfeiting, fraud and conspiracy. And I'm currently awaiting 22 years\nsentence in federal prison. Lesson learned. There was a hackers convention in Netherlands There was a young hacker there who used the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto and he talked to a friend of mine and he identified the Liberty Dollar and me as Inspiring him to create a new currency. Bernard von NotHaus's arrests\nfor creating private money may also have inspired Bitcoins inventor\nto keep a lower profile. Publishing the invention under an alias ... ... and vanishing. Part of me is interested to know like who Satoshi is Maybe that's part of the mystique of the story. It's completely irrelevant to the functioning of Bitcoin, because we have the code to read. But it would be kind of fun to know. Who is Archimedes ? Who is Euclid ? We don't know. We don't know if you Euclid was\none person or multiple people, and you know what, it doesn't matter. Euclidean geometry works, whether I know who Euclid was or not. Whether Euclid was a moral and good person or whether he was a corrupt plutocrat and a bastard ! Science and mathematics have essential truth, that stands alone irrespective of it's inventors, and irrespective of their motives. Well, Bitcoin is a system based on mathematical truths and these mathematical truths stand alone. We can read the source code in Bitcoin\nand understand it and it will be true whether Satoshi Nakamoto\nis a man, a woman, a collection of individuals, a government agency, or aliens from the future. Bitcoin is digital currency and computer software. Capital \"B\" Bitcoin is the shared code that creates a global payment network using computers connected to the Internet. bitcoins are virtual currency, digital money created stored and exchanged on that network. But unlike virtual Dollars created by a banker this new currency was created with math\nby an anonymous inventor. Bitcoin is an open source software protocol, like much of the code supporting the internet and email. Open source means anyone, everyone,\ncan use the protocol No, one person or company can control it. Every change to the software is public, open\nand transparent. The code was first developed by Satoshi Then there were dozens now hundreds of programmers Constantly collaborating to improve Bitcoin's features and security. So what makes Bitcoin a breakthrough ? it tackles an ancient human dilemma, and solves a computer science problem. Any shared information or data can be flawed, corrupted. Anything can be faked. How do we know that what we're receiving\ncan be trusted ? In our traditional mindset, it's very important to know who is behind this currency. Because their reputation is significant in knowing that our funds and our true wealth is actually safe. In finance, we rely on trusted third parties like banks, credit card companies, remittance services They keep track of money as it moves\nfrom one account to another and they charge us handsomely for it. We trust that their digital ledgers of\ncredits and debits, balance. A financial system that cuts out these middlemen, could be faster, cheaper and more secure. But Bitcoin is digital. Music and movies are easily pirated, copied, stolen. How can a digital currency retain value if anyone can make a million copies? The answer is at the core of Satoshi's invention. A Bitcoin is not a file on a computer. It's an entry in the publicly distributed database,\ncalled the blockchain. Just as the Medici kept a ledger of credits and debits, today's banks record each transaction as a plus and minus in their ledgers. Now we call them databases. Bank accounts are replaced by a digital wallet\nthat you alone control. Bitcoin's ledger is the blockchain. A record of every Bitcoin in existence, and every Bitcoin transaction ever made. It always balances, because no Bitcoin ever leaves it. When a Bitcoin is sent from one digital wallet to another, what they are really sending is\ncontrol over that part of the database. Code, that is a unique key for the new owner As the network processes transactions, It constantly synchronizes the one ledger \nacross the global network. Each computer or \"Bitcoin miner\" has a \ncomplete and identical copy. And because the blockchain is public, it cannot be controlled by any one person or computer. Owners of the Bitcoin mining computers are rewarded with new bitcoins for\nprocessing transactions and keeping the network secure. In other words the Bitcoin network\nreplaces banks and bankers Today the combined computing power\nof this global network, is greater than the 500 biggest\nsupercomputers combined times 10,000 Because every transaction is verified\nand recorded by the network, a Bitcoin cannot be forged. Digital currency cannot be debased with cheap metals, or printed by the billion at will. Too much currency can unleash a monster. Skyrocketing prices, trillion dollar bills that can't buy a loaf of bread. There's a big movement in the US, demanding that the Fed be audited\nso we can find out what they're doing. Nobody really knows how many dollars are in existence. For example, Ben Bernanke created\nseveral trillions of dollars over the last several years, but nobody really knows where they landed. At any time for any reason the central banks can print as much money as they want. They call it fancy things like \"quantitative easing\" and when they do that It makes\nthe Dollars or Euros or Yen that you and I have worth less. So if the world starts using Bitcoin as their currency, it can't be controlled by central bankers or politicians. Remember, central bank's create money\nto boost the economy and try to pull it back out before inflation heats up. But no one knows how much magic money\nglobal banks are creating to boost their profits with questionable loans. Bitcoin's completely opposite. It's totally transparent. You know exactly how many exists. The computer code behind Bitcoin\nhas a built-in brake pedal, cutting the creation of bitcoins in half every four years. This ensures a transparent controlled scarcity. And ultimately limits the total number of bitcoins\nto 21 million No lobbyists, no politician, no banker, can create more, or change the mathematical rules\ndictating their creation. and that's the thing I think is most exciting about Bitcoin and the technology behind it is not so much that it will supplant the dollar, or that it will supplant government itself, But that all of a sudden there's a competitive to government and the government itself now needs to look over its shoulder more than it did. This new digital currency can be purchased\nonline with a credit card, or in person with cash. And it has the five key characteristics of money. But is it a store of value? Is it stable or will it diminish over time like a commodity rendered useless or a crop that fails ? The ultimate power of a cryptocurrency is unleashed by mainstream adoption and an ever-growing volume of transactions. With Bitcoin the currency has been created much more slowly than other currencies, and the effect of that has been to turn it into what is essentially a speculative asset. if you ask a lot of Bitcoin enthusiasts, whether they're spending the currency, they're not. They're sitting on it\nwaiting for the price to go up. It isn't a currency if you don't use it to pay people. The point is the average person is quite happy to walk into a bar and hand over, you know a $5 note in order to get a drink. so you've got to realize that most people are happy with the money system they have. If most people are happy with cash They're in love with plastic. In the US 2/3 of in-person sales are done\nwith debit or credit cards. That plastic is a 60 year-old technology. Created by a middleman, never designed for the Internet, each transaction requires personal data \nlike your name and address. Credit card databases are regularly hacked. with fraudulent purchases charged to your account. criminals buy and sell stolen credit cards \nby the thousands in dark corners of the Internet. In some parts of London 1/3 of all online credit card transactions are fraudulent. Card issuers don't hold you responsible for fraud, but protection comes with a price. 2 - 4 percent in fees.\nThat's 50 billion Dollars a year. The issue with credit cards from a \nmerchants perspective, is there's a lot of risk. If they take a credit card there might be a charge back. There might be fraudulent purchases. In fact, there's hundreds of billions of dollars every year in fraudulent purchases. A Bitcoin purchase is done for pennies,\nBut there are no protections. If you lose your passwords\nor are fooled into paying the wrong person, You can never get your money back. It is like digital cash. For a seller, this means no charge back risks. For an e-commerce company like Expedia or Overstock cutting credit card fees can double their profit margin. You could not miss the points more effectively, than by thinking of Bitcoin \nas a currency and payment network that will make shopping easier for the first world. Bitcoin is about everything else everywhere else. There are 2.5 billion people without a bank account. With Bitcoin a mobile phone with an internet connection is now a bank, with access to the global marketplace. What happens when Bitcoin services and infrastructure and Bitcoin wallets and payment processes start going into these countries ? These people will be able to gain benefits from trade where they could not previously. These people will be able to send money home, International remittance. Which is one of the major paying points\nof the current financial system. Here if I send $100 with banks\nit's going to cost me 20% Western Union is going to cost 10% other options that are competing with Western Union still going to be about 5% And if you are sending to really remote areas it's going to be anywhere between 15 and 30 percent. So in terms of money remittances, it's gonna be a game-changer using Bitcoin. You do not need a bank account. You just need an internet connection\nand a wallet to get set up. It's a tool to give people an access\ninto the global ecosystem and give them a promise for an economic future. And specifically provide a way for them to not be dependent on a government that could shut down their bank accounts or even could go into their bank accounts \nand take out finances. Goldman Sachs came out with a report and they basically looked at if you were to replace all transactions globally, so FX, bank to bank transactions\nwith the Bitcoin protocol and still charging 1% mind you, it would save the global economy $200 billion. So not million, $200 billion a year\nin saved transaction costs. Which ultimately goes back into the hands of the consumer. An international wire transfer can take up to four days. Yet the internet allows us to instantly and globally share text, pictures, videos, anything digital. Why not money ? Money which we now know\nonly exists as digits in the bank's database. Wouldn't be great. If you could send Bitcoin\ntransactions just simply via a tweet. For example, you would say\n@TheEndOfMoney $1 and so it'll be just that.\nAll you have to do is hashtag it with #tippercoin press send, and our Twitter bot\nwill process the transactions, notify you and give you a link. and this will allow you to either withdraw your Bitcoins or send it to someone else. With Bitcoin you can send $1 or $1 million\nworth of value anywhere in the world You can do it for free or you pay the Bitcoin network fee which is still just around a penny and there's nothing that the big banks or \npoliticians can do to stop it. A cryptocurrency that can only be\ncreated and transferred with computer networks, may be the next step of the digital revolution. The rise of machines. Self-driving cars, drones Robots that rely less and less on humans. What I often think is that the future of Bitcoin or digital currency from a broader perspective is really about machine to machine payments. So by the time you have an unmanned taxi \ndriving you around New York and then going to power up at an \nunmanned power station, or going to get repairs an unmanned auto shop, you'll see the machine to machine payments done with some sort of digital currency. We actually built this world that we live\nin over the last 200 or 300 years We've made some mistakes.\nWe've learnt to make things better. The idea that there's some magic key that if you just sort of stop doing a few things that there will be this perfect order that will settle is a very childish ideological delusion in my opinion But that is not to say that Bitcoin isn't an exciting thing. It's a terrifically exciting thing. But we have to try and engage with it\nwith working minds not with magical thinking. People are suggesting that it's going to be \nanother world currency, a rival of the Dollar or the Euro or the Yen. I think that's not going to happen. I prefer to trust the banks or the central government compared to the Bitcoin is because someone's accountable. Whereas with Bitcoin, It's completely deregulated. There's no central control.\n There's no one held accountable. It is a free float. It's purely demand and supply driven. So clearly this is not a currency. Currencies don't behave like this. What this is, is a high-risk speculative commodity So for the entrepreneurs, the bankers, the governments and everyone else studying and watching Bitcoin all I have to say is that there will probably be a lot of volatility in an upward trajectory, and to buckle up ! Criminals, scam artists, bad actors\nare drawn to any kind of money like a moth to a flame. Silk Road was a marketplace that was online,\nand it existed in the underground web. Now this marketplace allowed people to sell things\nthat were illegal to governments. fake IDs pirated music Bibles in North Korea Are crypto currencies inherently bad,\nor just the newest tool to acquire the forbidden? Porn is illegal in Iran. There was a few percentage points of sales on Silk Road was to sell porn to Iranians. Now a much broader one that gets a lot of press with the Silk Road is drugs. I've been doing research over the past couple of years into the online drug market places in the dark net using Tor and Bitcoin, as technologies to enable illicit drug transactions. We did a global survey of drug users, and we had over 20,000 people respond to that. and the majority of those people were buying traditionally illicit drugs, ecstasy, cannabis ... The FBI brought down Silk Road. It certainly hasn't stopped\nthe trading of illicit drugs online. A lot of people want to criticize Bitcoin for being used for illegal things or illicit things But if you look at it, the most popular currency in the entire world for doing bad things, is the US Dollar. If you think of Bitcoin as a platform\ninstead of a currency, then you really begin to see the potential it has. The ledger which cannot be forged.\nIt cannot be changed. The universe accepts it.\nIt's genius ! There will be Bitcoin technology forever, and it'll have applications for years to come. Creating a secure global payment system \nmay just be the beginning. Patents, contracts, land titles, proof of ownership, can be baked into Bitcoin,\nsecurely held in the public ledger. I Read up a bit more about Bitcoin,\nI played with the source code I built some things that I realized this is actually a very very powerful protocol. It's not just a currency, but it's actually programmable money. The digital age has fundamentally changed the world. We have embraced digitized music, film, medical records, communications  ... ... The internet. The free exchange of information and \ncurrency can fuel revolutions Help in a disaster. But our money is shackled to the 20th century. Manipulated by governments and banks. The champions of Bitcoin ask us to imagine payments without a middleman, Investments without a broker, loans without a bank, insurance without an underwriter, charity without a trustee, Escrow without an agent, betting without a bookie, record-keeping without an accountant . Global, secure, nearly instant and free. is it fantasy ... ? Or the future of money and commerce I Love bitcoins. I'm really into bitcoins. Well Satoshi Nakamoto, that's the name. I love to say and we don't know much about him, but he came to save the day If you don't know what a Bitcoin is rice, usually the way people describe it is digital cash its money Into the old J\u00f3ska banking, you know, what's two plus two is like well I can tell you but there's a fade Down the road will be told about the death of old Mount GOx about traders trading altar coins and miners mining now big parties and their technology I like to say banking in lies see all of the convenience. None of these Into the old block chain up it I know you're going to rain gonna rain till everybody knows everybody knows, you know when I go online and I buy like I know pair of socks if I pay with a credit card I'm just buying socks, right if I buy those socks with Bitcoin. It's a revolution I Am sticking it to the man Pass B, Samar there's always people we're not ready to get into the new technology, you know, like when the internet came out there was gonna Be Like nah, this isn't gonna catch on And now Bitcoin comes out people like I don't think I'm like, aren't you sick of being wrong? Get on this train", "vw7XESyelaA": "all right this doesn't work wait a second maybe i should do this hi hi guys one second um i need to make this right uh sorry about the really close up of my face trying to fix this one second it's coming all right great i think it's working now all right so oh hi paris jones oh thanks for joining hi leilani itana sean thanks everyone thanks everyone for joining oh so wait this can you guys see peanut no all right all right all right so actually just like last time um i was trying to set up the camera so i forgot to clean it up a little um you know what forget it i don't care it's it can just be like this um so there's there's peanut and then one second see oh wait tofu was here where did she go oh dumplings here yeah she doesn't want to see the camera and tofu is hiding right here show your face all right so that's that so today i wanted to talk about something uh you guys all know that peanut used to have a little bit of the uh the respiratory problem right did you guys already know that so cute right uh so i just wanted to show you guys what i did um and of course um i had to talk to the vet oh sorry i i pressed the power button accidentally um yeah so i wanted to talk a little bit about what i did um and um so first thing that i did was i had to go to the vet um i talked to the doctor and first step i would say is to find the right vet because originally i had not so great fat and um once i found the right vet who really knew like uh the guinea pig really well um she gave us the antibiotics and all that stuff and because of the respiratory problem you gotta get rid of all the bacteria and dirty stuff so this is what i did i wanted to show i'm doing the front facing camera because i want to show you guys this one second so do you guys know what this is so it's a raspberry ironic whatever this is from phillips so this is actually made for humans so what they what it does is it creates a vapor so you put you put like a mask on your mouth and then it gives you that moisture so that your like respiratory system gets like moist so obviously you can't use that you can't use the same mask for hum for guinea pigs because it's so mask is so big right so what i had to do was essentially here so this tube is connected to here this thing right here and what you do is you put the saline solution here and it creates some moisture and because this is the like it's not like perfectly airtight but it's a little bit airtight so that this whole place whole thing becomes like a sauna right so and i just added this because of the bottom attachment it has a little bit of thing right here so i created this to like lift it a little bit and um so this is this is how what i did so after i made it i realized this is a little bit small so peanut when she goes in here she's like almost like you know she almost feels the space and this thing is definitely too small for tofu so um if you guys are making it i suggest that i just suggest you guys to make it with a bigger bigger plastic bit so that's that and when i when i put peanut in i made sure i put the you know small uh guinea that pea pad in here that actually fits pretty well right here so she would like to stay here and maybe eat like some vegetable or cookie while she gets the treatment so that's what i did oh yeah there are a lot of new people today but um yeah so you know but you don't want to obviously suffocate the guinea pigs so i put the hole i drew drilled a hole on top but you know it's um [Music] but uh i realized that because the vapor comes upward i had to reseal this part like with the tape because it would just exit but i still left it here but now to think about it maybe i should have put the hole like at the bottom so that like it would only exit when it like sinks down to the bottom so i i i did this and it actually works really well um obviously the the antibiotic that vet gave me it worked really well but you know after doing this um like she she even after the antibodies she had like small sneezes here and there but whenever i did this for that day um within that like 24 hour or so like her sneeze would like stop like she hasn't done this for a while but obviously because she doesn't have any problems but um if anyone is having that upper respiratory issue with their guinea pig or they have some sneezing problem you know this is a great solution um talk to your vet about it too so that's that all right oh man it's kind of 2 30 huh i you know what i'm gonna do what i do usually i'll just i'll set up the camera right here and then you guys can watch peanut tofu and dumpling while i uh clean the cage i'll be back guys ugh uh so come on all right let me move the camera so you can see the girls huh so okay some more all right done sorry i keep pressing the live uh power button so um since i already talked about the respiratory stuff it's just going to be normal q a with a lot of guinea pig a lot of peanut tofu and dumpling well someone's doing homework get the camera oh pinot came out oh she's peanut is unhappy about something oh thank you thanks thanks for sharing lila i'm glad your guinea pig likes the liner pocket they love hiding in there right peanut is mad yeah she's i don't know what she's mad about she seems to be she's doing fine taylor oh thanks for sharing that too oh serena so sir and i asked what is the best way to clean hay when living in an apartment so do the same thing that i do you know like just spot clean with that thing and then it takes like two minutes and you just you know have like trash can ready like that and then you know just wrap it up and that's it it's actually pretty easy oh oh amy so if your package was damaged um contact contact our through our website so we have the contact contact page on our website just write it there and then um we should be able to help you lila says i hope to get p flakes for them soon yeah they love p flakes so just to let you guys know like the instruction i mean i i've seen written the instruction for the p flake to give like two to three a day but um because of the high protein or whatnot but then when i was doing that i didn't really think too much about um like the protein of the dry p-flake and plus like you can't really give them two or three like so personally i i don't know if it's i mean it didn't really change their weight either so that's why i'm sharing with you guys i just give them like maybe um maybe five five or six pieces a day and um i like it's actually so i'm i'm surprised to know that they actually don't eat more than five or six like they go crazy whenever i bring out the p flake and they like eat as if like they're gonna finish the whole bag but once they eat like five or six a day they're kind of like satisfied they want to eat more but they're kind of satisfied so you know you guys can do that too if you have the same problem oh thank you amy yeah i mean our customer service should definitely be able to help you like we try to make sure like everyone's happy so oh peanuts peanuts doing fine i mean she got she was um she had a little bit of an issue for respiratory issue for like two months and um yeah she's okay yeah but then like she never acted sick you know so lori says i'm wanting to get my first first set of piggies this year however i'm having a hard time finding any that are not from pastor any advice so if you're trying to adopt a guinea pig try to find a go to a rescue center um there there are a lot of rescue centers um and it can be a guinea pig specific rescue center or it can just be normal rescue center a lot of rescue centers normal rescue centers that is like dogs and cats they also have guinea pig uh yeah try to yeah that's a good good suggestion i think the best place to best place is like the pathfinder and i think um do you guys know website called guinea links um so they have a couple in the list there but um it's a little bit outdated plus like you know like they they always say you have to get it from get the guinea pig from guinea pig rescue center but it's not that's not true so we work with nevada stca in nevada and um they do really good job taking care of small animals as well so um yeah just just just call the rescue center near you so how much are the liners it depends on the size so it's like these are like full sizes they can be like 50 but the smaller sizes are like even smaller sizes are different like there are three packs that are i think about 30s and they're like um a singles that are like 20s yeah gimme link says so if you guys haven't heard about the website so it's like the website for medical information so if and also they have pretty good guinea pig care guide so serena um so regarding pallets um so pellets are there to supplement them right so a main main thing they need other than hay which is their diet that's timothy that's orchard type of grass hay oh oops sorry guys oh they got scared because of my sneeze too but anyways um yeah other than hey what you need is most need is vitamin c but you can always supplement it by giving them vegetables like green peppers or any kind of bell pepper mostly and you can also get them like leafy vegetable and other vegetables to supplement other micronutrients right but pellets make it more easy for you how much is p-flat uh i forget exactly but i think the four ounce one was like a little bit under ten dollars and then i think ten ounces over ten dollars you can go to a guinea pig sorry uh you can go to uh guinea.guinea.guinea.com to uh check out our like products so okay so going back to the palette so i i personally do give palettes right i do get vegetables i do give them all the like um i'll try to i try to give them all the healthy stuff but at the end of the day like i am not like i want to make sure they have all the nutrients uh they get all the nutrients that they need so even though every single pellet that you're gonna come across not ever i i don't want to say every single pellet but 99 percent of pellet out there they do contain some some kind of fillers or something that are not necessarily the best for their uh health but that being said they also contain a lot of healthy stuff so will you have to shave their hair no um i've never cut their hair or shaved their hair but that's mostly because like they're american and she's like a mix but kind of american but if you have like long-haired guinea pigs then you might have to trim their hairs here and there i've seen people do it yeah it's okay it's okay to see the phone screen and tv screen yes uh danka i actually use oxbow pellets as well i think um i usually i mean i i have to i purchase pallets from like pet stores and um i feel like oxbow feels the most okay but then i've heard like some like uh some german brands are pretty good too so but i haven't really checked them in detail oh when i say palace i'm not talking about the vitamin c palace i'm talking about uh like like food palettes but oh yeah vitamin c palettes so well i actually talked to vet about it um and they she said that you know it doesn't hurt to give them but it's most likely that if you want to make sure they're supplemented supplemented correctly make sure you give them vegetable like green bell pepper red bell pepper yellow bell pepper like that bell pepper is what arguably one of the best vegetable for guinea pigs so how do you clean them clean the liner is that what you're saying so i use like a machine like the sweeper in an electric you just like roll it and then it all the poop and some of the hay gets picked up so that's how i clean it uh daily or twice a day and once a week once it's pretty clean i put it into a laundry machine to make sure i wash out all the you know urine that's deposited inside peanut is peanut isn't like super happy right now for some reason well uh you guys know about the queen's castle right i mean it it came out and then it ran out but uh before we're coming out with the new batch of it we actually made couple improvements and then it'll come out but it's still it's still going to take like a couple months so serena if you're you know i think the type of palette is also important but it's all what's also important is the amount of pallets so if you see your guinea pig gaining too much weight make sure you're cutting the amount of pellets obviously you're gonna see your guinea pig a little bit less happy about that because they just want to eat a lot but at the same time like you don't give your kid like all the candy that they want right so it's the same logic so that's we have to be we have to make sure that they stay healthy and if they're gaining too much weight cut down on the pellets do guinea pigs need to go to a vet once a year for a checkup uh yes so once a year is good um some vets do say you know once in six months is better but um definitely at least once a year oh thank you ashley uh actually so it also depends on the palette um maybe you're the palette that you're giving is like lower calorie but a lot of the american brand uh palace like pallets they usually recommend 1 8 of a cup per day so you know it depends yeah danka i think you're doing a good job you you have to make sure um yeah you have to make sure that you watch the weight if they're gaining weight like lower it you know that's definitely good yeah i think amount of pallet it really depends on the brand some brands are like lower calorie than others oh thanks for joining kirby uh not not nothing much i'm just doing q a right now you didn't miss much i'll be able to do something more fun when i have an editor but you know um i have like a lot of stuff to do a lot of stuff on my hand so um i wasn't able to invest my time in finding a good editor but i'll definitely work on that who is the softest pig tailor mad set so it's definitely tofu her she's the softest oh yeah those like small scales are definitely good to have and just like visa they're not expensive oh thank you thank you graciela leonardo yeah peanuts okay peanuts peanuts okay now oh tofu is not small actually the thing is my girls are relatively small these boxes so they contain more than more than it looks because it's like um we we try to fit a lot and each one is like each one is about three pounds but each order is about nine pounds um the the thing about thing about guinea that hay is we we actually um waste a lot of it because we do a special filtration process where it like filters out all the bad stuff and dust and all the stuff and then we lose like you know tens of percentage of the weight so you know this is like nine pound but if i if we were to if you were to convert this into the original weight it's like over 10. oh yeah walmart has some good scales too but you can get scales pretty much everywhere hannah uh asked what kind of hate is in the hate box uh and you have some allergies so most likely you have allergies to timothy so that's the timothy hey the orange one um so we also offer orchard so a lot of people who's allergic to timothy they do the orchard but um actually a lot of the reviews say that people who are allergic to timothy they are okay with our timothy just because it's contained in the boxing you actually never have to like um touch it but obviously if i i don't have an allergy but if i had to make the allergy i would just get orchard i know we were planning on the minecraft server and then all kind of stuff happened oh you have the dust allergy too yeah that's the thing right like uh you know some people have dust allergy but yeah you have to think about from guinea pig's point of view like guinea pigs it doesn't have dust allergy per se but dust is the worst enemy to guinea pigs so like whatever you do there will be some dust in your house but you know it's our job to make sure it's as dust less as possible so um i mean that's what we try to do here at like in our company we try to produce every product so that it minimizes the dust and bacterial growth that's essentially what we do in most of our products i know right like tofu does that too tofu when i try to hand feed her the vegetable she just uh takes it and runs away eats it in the corner and comes back that's what tofu does like you need that skin like for for the app that's dumpling hey dumpling she doesn't want to go oh tofu came inside oh and peanuts jealous oh for for the new baby guinea pigs uh try to give some orchard obviously have the same main diet uh hey like timothy hey or orchard hey but also try to get some alfalfa and uh when you're giving obviously like if you have new guinea pig for the first time and if they're a baby i'm going to assume that you are not as experienced raising them so try to give them pallets because uh and then you can learn little by little and try to like cut down on the palette but i mean even for experienced people it's good it it's okay to get palettes but anyways um for the palettes for baby guinea pigs make sure you get the one for young guinea pigs so you're supposed to feed those like young guinea pig palace for um about like six months old up until six months old oh yeah so uh we originally gave the mini patch to um like you can test it and you can also see like what's actually inside and um like lastly it's kind of for that kind of purpose too now i've seen a lot of people use it so that like right under the water bottle water drips so that it doesn't make the liner wetter than it's supposed to but i've actually some so i've actually seen some people use it as a like a coaster for their coffee cup too i mean really you can do whatever with it there there isn't really much use to it you can you can do anything oh minecraft skin oh that could be cool karen so um i think first thing is i think you should see a vet um and get it probably the doctor is going to try to um yeah the doctor is trying to give the x-ray let you have the x-ray oh yeah actually i wanted to start minecraft but i never started either oh yeah are you talking about the gimme that sticker like the logo sticker or the like our merch merge stickers oh jocelyn oh you're talking about the logo sticker yeah i think i think sean sean has the logo sticker on back of this car too and i've seen some people do that and i think a lot of them put it on the water bottle or the laptop or the smartphone uh smartphone cases so so um guys so i have a question before i before i log out i mean it's it's been like 35 minutes already but you know last you guys saw that last time i did the live at 10 a.m and at that time like we usually have like you know 100 people not not exactly 100 but like close to 100 people join but today i see that like it's about like 40 or 50 or so um i chose this time based on the uh based on the survey that we did on the youtube community is it is this time better or uh should i just go back to 10 am pst which is 1pm est i usually go on live on wednesday oh it's 12 30 in uk but it's not in the hand great i mean i i mean i guess it's uh bias because i'm asking people who joined this time but um okay i see also it's 12 12 a.m like midnight in uh uk right now actually like i'm i'm actually kind of surprised that a lot of people joined from uk i guess that's what happened we lost a lot of uk people oh no you didn't you didn't miss much we're just chatting yeah i think a lot of people are are in school when i do it in the morning right oh man i wish there was a time that would work for everyone how soon before the queen's castle is back uh i mean i'm really frustrated too because um yeah but um hopefully hopefully in um i don't think it'll be back in less than less than a month probably more than a month different day so if i were to do it in a different day like what what what would i what should i do not thursday which day tell me like uh which day is best for you guys monday to sunday the weekend wednesday so if i do you think if i do it in the weekend um the morning is okay like 10 a.m in the west coast then 1 p.m in the east coast no keep it on wednesday man i think i think i'll probably have to i think i'll probably have to um [Music] kind of go back to this live and look at all the comments like there's so many so many

lightweight lightweight shipment so maybe we can okay oh is that why even if it's like dried dried plants it's like all sealed and everything but i'll have to check with sean and the operations team like what what's what's up with that maybe that is that is why because it's like plant um well formerly living thanks [Laughter] yes they they were all formally living things like even the hay but um oh actually you know what i'm not sure if it's available yet but if it's not we should be able to ship uh hay to canada at least very soon if not already so um you know if that means if that's true then we might be able to make the herbal stuff work and p flake work too but anyways i'll have to talk to the operations team again and then let's let you i'll let you guys know next week um thank well thanks everyone for joining um it kind of went much longer than i expected so um well even pino says it was kind of too long and she's sleepy now she's gonna take a nap well thanks everyone for

bye", "qgssYNSMheg": "hello everyone welcome back to my video in this channel today I'm going to show you how to comfort round 2 cups so the question is a Coastie cups how to confer it alright here's the question accounts equals how many cup alright this is the question section now we are moving to the formula before we answer the question we need to know the formula so we use an us standard for the formula between owns in cup so one fluid ounce equals 0.125 cup you need to maybe you need to remember that but I don't I don't ask you to my because if you already understand the concept then there's nothing need to be remember memorize I mean alright here's the answer section first we write down the question again like arms equals how many cup and then this is the formula just like what I wrote before one ounce equals 0.125 cup and this is how we answer the question first to aunt to answer this question first we need to put this formula 1 ounce I call this number 2 here alright so this is the formula and then because you have a right here then you must put the egg in the left side of the equal sign and then in the right side of the equal sign so you multiply 1 ounce with a and 0.125 car with a alright so 8 times 1 equals egg bounce and 0.125 cup time a equals one cup so this is the answer of the question that's all it's very easy right alright everyone thank you for watching my

after using it for 14 days and if you'd like to see more awesome content like this please consider hitting the subscribe button and help your brother out anyways with that said let's jump into the video so when it comes to the sweet cake packaging this is how it looks like so after opening it says not today sugar we believe that big changes start small that the power to transform our lives is right there for the taking and doesn't require any superpowers or superhuman self-control so we created sweet kick simple honest products designed to help you fight your daily sugar cravings sweet kick when opening the sugar reset guide it says my name is harley pesterneck and i'm a sugar addict for the past 20 years i've dedicated my life to fitness and nutrition written seven books on the subject and worked with some of the biggest celebrities in the world after all these years of experience one thing i can say for certain we all struggle with sugar cravings i grew up with two brothers who had diabetes while i was lucky enough not to become diabetic myself i can honestly say i'm a full-blown sugar addict as co-founder of sweet cake my mission is to give you the tools you need to change your relationship with sugar so you can finally control your cravings ready to get your sugar fix you can do this we can help so i was quite interested as to how much sugar man is meant to consume every single day and when i searched it up it said that it's okay for men to consume 36 grams of sugar every single day while for a woman it's only 24 grams and i already know that in the last two and a half months when it comes to this uk lockdown i haven't particularly focused that much on my health and on my diet even though i have been consistently going for a run and doing home workouts i still feel like it isn't enough so when i look through the sugar reset guide a lot of the things mentioned where things are already new but was definitely a good reminder to read it again because it says that the benefits of a low sugar lifestyle is weight loss increased energy mood stability better sleep younger skin improved cognitive function lower risk of type 2 diabetes reduce risk of heart disease reduce risk of some cancers and reduce risk of fatty liver disease it says that the sweet cake 14 day sugar reset program is designed to kickstart your low sugar lifestyle by rebuilding healthier habits it starts with balanced blood sugar levels which help controls your appetite ultimately diminishing cravings and replacing empty calories with healthy nutrient-dense ones this program gives you the knowledge and power you need to make mindful decisions and reshape your relationship with sugar every day if you're ready your reset starts now so what can you expect after extended periods of consumption our bodies become accustomed to the sugar cycle when we significantly reduce our sugar intake sometimes that can lead to symptoms of withdrawal they say that the control means may be small but they're mighty instead of reaching for a treat when craving strikes reach for them throughout your day to steadily suppress the sweet taste of sugary snacks and drinks it also contains 14 body balance powders this potent powder kicks your body into high gear thanks to its propertary prebiotic fiber blend and nutrients that work to help curb your body's physiological dependency on unhealthy sugars and when it comes to these two products i'll talk a bit more about my experience after using them for 14 days sweet cake sugar control mints contain the herb gymnema sylvester from india known as the sugar destroyer the simple ritual of dissolving a sugar control mint on your tongue also dissolves the sweet taste of those treats you crave and because tasting is believing by suppressing the sweet taste of sugary foods and drinks you alter your brain's perception of them when sweets start to become less enjoyable you start to see them for the unhealthy empty calories they really are that's when you really start changing your habits so the way you use the sugar control mint is you pop a mint three times a day when craving strikes and let it completely dissolve and then you suppress the taste of the sweetness from the sugary snacks you crave and by this you break the sugar cycle and take control of your cravings and when it comes to the body balance powder sweet cake body balance powder is packed with 100 vegan super blend of prebiotic fiber vitamins and minerals to kick-start your blood sugar day their powder supports balance blood sugar levels gut health and boost your body's ability to metabolize carbohydrates and fat into all the energy when we're asleep our bodies are in a state of fasting which causes blood sugar levels to drop upon waking our need for sugar sometimes means we grab a guilty pleasure and make poor choices you can break these cravings by using the body balance powder and the way you use it is you pour one packet of powder into your morning beverage of choice and then stay until the power fully dissolves and enjoy which then helps support healthy blood sugar levels gut health and sugar cravings and when it comes to the food mentor guide it gives us eight principles of low sugar lifestyle where talks about not so good carbs and good carbs and any follow-ups by talking about hidden sugars eat more often with the five benefits eat more fiber with five benefits eat more protein with five benefits eat more healthy fats with five benefits drink more water with 5 benefits get more sleep with 5 benefits and then it talks about things you can eat all you want things you can treat yourself in moderation and things you should delete and stay away from all right so now i'd like to move on to the benefits and advantages of using sweet kick for 14 days so when it comes to the sugar control mint initially when you put it into your mouth it just simply feels like any sort of generic mint but then after the mint starts to dissolve you generally feel like that your tongue is getting a little bit more suppressed it's not any sort of severe suppression but you generally feel that it's a bit different than it was before they recommend you to use this mint every three to four hours after you initially use it to keep your cravings under control but in my experience it lasts four to six hours so when it comes to sweet cravings i'm genuinely impressed when it comes to this product because once you actually use one of those mints it can easily last for quite a long time i don't have any sort of sugar cravings and taking myself as an example when it comes to sugar intake i saw that my sugar intake tends to fluctuate between 50 to 80 grams a day and comparing this to what is recommended it's way above it even though i thought that i was pretty close to it since i'm not particularly the most unhealthy guy because when it comes to the sugar control mint they actually recommend you to give it a shot they say pop a mint and let it fully dissolve on your tongue grab your favorite sweet treat and give it a taste not so sweet is it want another bite didn't think so and when it comes to my experience when i did this it really reduced the sweet taste but it definitely wasn't disgusting in the end of the world but regardless it definitely takes away the kick that you get after consuming sugar and when it comes to the body balance powder this is definitely the better thing in my opinion because when it comes to me when i wake up in the morning i'm one of those individuals has to put a lot of effort to get out of the bed but after using the body balance powder for 14 days i definitely feel that it gives you a kickstart it isn't one of those powders that diminishes the taste of your drink instead in my opinion it makes it taste a little bit better and the great thing is that it helps to support your healthy blood sugar levels gut health and sugar cravings and i definitely agree with it because when it comes to love powders or any sort of health and well-being product it usually tends to take a few days but when it comes to this particular product when i started to use it i initially saw some results and i definitely felt that it elevated my mood so when it comes to this product and controlling your sugar levels i definitely feel like that it works i have the product linked down below if you're interested and that pretty much sums it up for this video i hope you found the information useful if you did please leave a thumbs up for the youtube algorithm and consider

"SspvCGqwQ38": "coming up on today's episode of detailing basics I'm going to show you the simple way to work out dilution ratios in detailing products you so getting started with your diluting Rios it's quite straightforward your standard spray bottle holds 947 milliliters but let's just say it holds 900 milliliters it makes it a lot easier if you narrow your figures down to those sorts of things so take for example if we've got this quick detailer and this quick detailer to bead it to be diluted down as a quick detailer is a five to one so that's five parts water to one part product so what we do is we add those two together which gives us six and then we divide the total volume of our container 900 by the six that gives us 150 so each part is 150 milliliters so if we were dilating this down five to one we'd have 750 milliliters of water and 150 milliliters of this product that would then give us a quick detailer at five-to-one quite straightforward if we were going to use this say as a clay lubricant ten-to-one can work that out quite straightforward gives us 11 part so we've now got to divide a 900 mil by 11 gives us eighty one point eight so we're going to use 818 milliliters of water and eighty-one milliliters of product that then gives us a ten-to-one clay loop nice and straightforward so next up let's say we've got this which is a all-purpose clear citrus-based one like this product it's pretty good cleans a lot of crap off so yeah right what we're going to do now on this bottle they're actually the opposite way around than they are on the quick detailer so on the quick detailer and this might be where some of your confusion lies on your quick detailer it's listed is for example 2 to 1 5 to 1 10 to 1 on here it's listed as 1 to 100 and 1 to 8 now that might be where people are getting confused sometimes it doesn't help when they're listed in different ways round what you want is always going to be this product so it's whatever you are diluting and the larger number is generally going to be the dilute and in this case water so this is a 1 to 100 so it's a hundred to one we'll put it back the right way around so if we want to dial it this down a hundred to one we end up with 8.9 because we've got a hundred and one part remember we have to add the hundred and one together so we end up with 101 power to 8.9 so we need eight hundred and ninety-one milliliters of water and 8.9 milliliters of this product so you can put nine in don't be worrying it's not going to blow up it'll be fine so what's next if you want to use this as a degreaser for example that's an eight to one dilutions and that will shift a lot of stuff so at eight to one you're looking at nine parts in total remember so 8 + 1 9 easy home 8 of 1 so then you ended up with 9 part a hundred each so we need 800 milliliters of water and we need 100 milliliters of this and then we get our 900 milliliters in total see I told you it was straightforward it's really easy once you know how to do it working out dilution ratios is so straightforward and so easy all you need is to add the numbers together and then divide your total volume by that it's dead straightforward I put all the numbers on the screen for you hopefully I haven't confused it too much and you can get through using just this guide and I really do hope it's helped if you found it useful give it a thumbs up if you've got any tips you want to share or if there's anything else you want to see leave it in the comments below and subscribe to be notified when I upload new videos

multi-step inequalities solve each inequality and graph its solution so if I was given this inequality 8 times 1 plus 8x plus 8 times X minus 11 is less than a negative 10 X plus 2x all right first thing let's to distribute with to each parenthesis 8 times 1 is 8 plus 8 times 8 is 64 X now we add 8 times X plus 8 X + 8 times a minus 11 is a minus 88 that's less than negative 10 X plus 2 X is a negative 8x Plus that's my daughter now below me they're just amazed all right come on our like terms on each side 64 X plus 8x comes to be a 72 X at 8 plus a negative 8 and minus and 88 is a minus 80 here and we still have less than negative 8x so let's combine our like terms access to the left numbers to the right we add an 8x to both sides here then we add an 80 to both sides now on the right there's no number there well it's a zero so we kind of put it on its own these eighties cancel and these x's cancel 72 X plus eight X isn't 80 X that's less than and now we just have an 80 on the right 80 X is less than 80 they're multiplications going on we divide by 80 to get rid of that and now X is by itself X is less than 80 divided by 80 is just a 1 so let's graph we have 0 1 2 3 4 negative 1 negative 2 negative 3x is not equal to one so that means we have an open circle right there X is less than one so the arrow goes to the left and there we have it our graph matches our final

Making Tips and Tricks. what's up everybody I'm tan from\ntemporary gifts and this is the tips and tricks video now in the intro I would\nhave liked have been able to list all the tips and tricks that I'm going to\nshow you in the video but it's kind of a work in progress I want to decided to go\nand do the intro I've got four or five other videos that I'm going to tack on\nto it but I'm probably not done yet I'm just gonna keep going and just as things\ncome up while I'm in my regular process that I think might want to be passed on\nI'll make a quick tips and tricks video and add into this video so I probably\nwould actually post this one for a while I'm just gonna kind of do bits and\npieces as I go and hopefully by the time it's you know lots of tips and tricks\nlet me say I'm by no means an expert you might see something in the video that\nyou think you've already got a handle on or that's great\ndefinitely I'm an expert but I do run a successful candle shop I've been doing\nthis for a while I have learned a few things on the way so I thought it might\nbe kinda nice to pass them on to somebody else it's really the only way\nwe learn none of us picked up a big box of supplies and decided we're gonna be\ncandle experts one day we got on YouTube we got on Google check one check out\nwhat everybody else is doing what we could then set out on our own chops and\nwent through our own trial went through our trial and error so hopefully in this\nvideo you'll see something that hasn't occurred to you and will help you in\nyour shop let's check out the first tip ok for this first tip I'm going to show\nyou how to get your color just exactly right now if you're making soy candles\nit's relatively easy but you're gonna find that getting your color just right\nis one of the hardest things if you're just making them for yourself and you're\nnot too worried about the color it's not that big of a deal but if you're making\nthem so if you've got them listed online somewhere if you're gonna resell them\nconsistency's pretty important right now we're making my riding mower candle it's\na pretty popular candle buy I've restocked at several times I've got\nseveral repeat customers so they expect it to be about the same every time they\nbuy it oK we've already got our wax melted down\nwe've already got our color added I've got the measurements that I used last\ntime so it's fairly easy for me but I still want to double-check it just to\nmake sure you'll find with the wax that it's gonna be a lot darker in its liquid\nform it's gonna dry a lot lighter so just looking at it right now I can't\ntell what the finished color is gonna be yeah\nwax dial use does have a color guide on it kind of an easy reference but we're\ngonna show you this trick and it's gonna make your life a lot better a lot better all we're gonna do we've got the wax\nmelted down we've got our color added all we're gonna do is just take a little\nflirt clear plastic container just gonna dip that out about that much that's\ngonna go in the freezer for about five to ten minutes that'll freeze go with\nsolid form and you'll be able to tell exactly what the color is now while\nyou're waiting for that to freeze your wax is okay to sit we don't have the\nfragrance oil added yet so we've got just the wax and the color dye so we can\njust let it sit we can turn it off and reheat it or we can set the temperature\nto about a mid range I usually do about 165 170 it's not going to hurt anything\nlong as you don't get it too hot you're not gonna scorch the wax I said I don't\nhave the fragrance all add it in yet so I don't have to worry about burning it\noff so we've let that freeze get it out the freezer and there we go we've got\nthe perfect color without even having to dry okay so I mentioned in one of my earlier\nvideos how it's important to measure your fragrance oils by weight rather\nthan volume we show you an example what I'm talking about you can see we've got\ntwo fragrance oils from the same company there's a both from rustic essentials\nit's red maple leaf and toasted marshmallow these are the 8 ounce\nfragrance models as you can see by looking at them it appears that there's\nmore in the red maple leaf than there is the toasted marshmallow but I'm going to\nshow you that there's not now if you were to measure it by volume using one\nof these your measurement is going to be all because you've got the toasted\nmarshmallow 8 ounce bottle 9.15 ounces that's accounting for the plastic bottle\nitself it looks like there should be more in the red maple leaf just by\nlooking at it but 9.15 ounces so they're both the same weight so if you measure\nby volume rather than weight your measurements are gonna be off so get you\na scale measure by weight okay so as you can see we've got our candles forward\nand we've overfilled one quite a bit I'll show you a nice easy way to clean\nthat up if you were to try to reap or that or tip that up and pour it into\nanother container you're just gonna make a huge mess so I'm gonna show you an\neasy way to fix this all you're gonna need is one of these this is a kitchen\nsyringe or a kitchen injector or a meat injector and give these a Walmart I\nthink it's about six or seven dollars all we're gonna do just draw out the\nexcess wax till we get it down to the level we wanted that you're on that\ncandle see now we can add this to another lower candle or another neat\ntrick with it we can use this on the smaller molds that are hard to fill if\nyou were to try to fill that with a pouring pitcher you're just gonna make a\nhuge mess but with this we can fill it up to the\nperfect level every time do you need to add that if you're gonna\nuse one of these this is only gonna work on a soy wax if you were to try to use\nthis with a blend or a paraffin or a gel wax it's gonna clog up on you and it's\ngonna be almost impossible to clean out so only four so on this one okay so if\nyou've done any type of candle making I'm sure you've heard the expression the\nfragrance load a lot of people call this the fragrance percentage basically it's\njust the amount of fragrance oil that you add to your melted wax to get the\ndesired load you can pretty much be anything you want it there is certain\nmaximum amounts that you can put in just refer to the type of wax that you're\nusing a lot of times on the packaging it'll show you the maximum amount of\nfragrance slow little old but basically it goes like this just bear with me I'm\nnot the greatest at math I'm a police officer but I use a lot of math my\nfiance is the accountant she can probably breeze through this a lot\nbetter than I can but it's a pretty simple equation so I'm sure I'll be able\nto get through it basically you're just going to take the amount of wax that\nyou're using the desired fragrance low percentage that you want does both apply\nthose two together and that will give you the ounces of fragrance load that\nyou need I've got the examples down here so basically it's going to go like this\nwe'll just use 16 ounces as a good example so we've got our 16 ounces of\nwax we want a 10% fragrance load anytime you're multiplying percentages you're\njust going to move the decimal point two places to the left again that's the best\nexplanation I can give you for multiplying percentages I'm not a math\nguy but this just needs to remember if so if it's 10% just move the decimal\nplace two points to the left so that gives us point 10 so 16 ounces times\npoints in gives us one point six ounces that's one point six ounces of fragrance\nload one thing to keep in mind if you're making an exactly an exact size of 16\nounces once you add all that together that's\ngoing to give you 17 point 6 ounces of actual product in you're pouring pot so\nif you've only got a 6 ounce can container a 16 ounce container\nyou're gonna have an ounce and a half of waste basically unless you've got\nsomething else for it to go into so you can play with the equation a little bit\nto figure out exactly on what you're gonna need so we have a 16-ounce\ncontainer just did a quick math in my head we can use fourteen point five\nounces of blacks for our 10% fragrance low that's one point four five ounces of\nfragrance oil and that in our pouring pot that gives us a total product weight\nof fifteen point nine five ounces so it's just something to watch if you want\nto keep on your waist fragrance oils can get pretty expensive so if you need a\n16-ounce candle you end up with an ounce and a half that you can't use it's gonna\ncost you money so just play with that equation like as if it's not lard it's\nonce again it's just the amount of wax you have times the desired percentage\nthat you want and that gives you the total weight that you're gonna need of\nyour fragrance oil hope that helps okay if you've done any cut any kind of\ncandle making already or research on candle making you've likely either seen\nor read about frosting that's a perfect example of what it is basically what's\nhappening is as the fragrance oil and the soy wax solidify and combined on the\nmolecular level the soy and the fragrance will want to form these little\nwhite crystals it's basically the soy returning back to its natural straight\nnatural state with the infusion of the fragrance oil molecules it ends up\nlooking like this now this doesn't affect the the smell of the candle at\nall it doesn't affect the performance of it just strictly cosmetic but if you're\nselling colored candles it can be pretty irritating because that definitely\ndoesn't look like what you want it to look like in your shop\na lot of a lot of candle shops won't even make color candles just because\nthey don't want to deal with this issue I found that some things you can do to\nminimize the effects of frosting but there's really no way surefire way that\nI found to prevent it if you checked a hundred different candle blogs you'd\ncome up with a hundred different answers a lot of people will tell you to only\nstir it a certain direction stir it so many times during a figure eight at your\nfragrance hold at this temperature report this temperature some will tell\nyou pour hotter than others to reduce it so I'm gonna tell you the pour colder\nthan others to do it I've seen one that told you to pour so cold that it was\nalmost like you know your wax had already started to solidify in the\npouring pot so you're basically pouring out these chunks of wax into your candle\nit was kind of messy it didn't really seem to help any some vlogs will tell\nyou you can use a stearic acid I've used that a couple times it seemed to help a\ntiny bit but stearic acid if you don't get it just right it'll actually affect\nthe cold and hot center of your candle so it's kind of a trade-off do you want\nthe looks or do you want your candle likes to perform and with stearic acid I\nmean your measurements have to be exact down to the down to the milligram if you\nhave too much it'll affect it if you add too little it'll affect it it's it's\nweird well we're going to show you how to fix it real quick there's this real\nsimple fix it's not going to cost you any extra takes a little bit of time and\nthen we'll bring your candle back to its original state of how you want it to\nlook when you're gonna sell it to a customer so let's check that out this is my eighth ounce gunpowder\ngunpowder candle actually got a couple of these going on in order later today\nas you can see the frosting really did a number on this one now when I poured\nthese and when they cool they look great just over time it seems no matter what\nyou do if the candle sits long enough it's gonna do this and unless you do\nsomething to fix it before you ship it this one's actually frost it's so bad\nyou can barely see the the original gray that it was it's almost frosted light to\nthe point where it kind of looks like it's supposed to be that way I could\nprobably pass it off and they would never know the difference it would work\ngreat but it's listed in this color so that's the color that I want it to be\nwhen I send it to the customer now in my equipment video you were seeing that I\nhad the up the heat gun this is what I use this forward to get rid of the\nfrosty it only takes a minute a few minutes after that to let your candle\nrisa lit a fire it's as good as nearly looks great and it's ready to go out to\nthe customer you can see what the crossing does to the table but the\nlighting will show it on this video once again does not affect the candle at all\ndoesn't affect the the feel of it the smell of it just mainly affects the look\nof it so what you want to do and what you're gonna want to be careful of when\nyou're heating this you can actually melt this entire candle you don't want\nthat basically you're just gonna want to do it very lightly on the outside of the\njar you're basically just heating up the jar you'll see once we get going all\nthose little crystal and air bubbles will start releasing floating up to the\ntop you just want to do the whole jar once over you'll see it darken up you'll\nget all that frosting out of there the outside layer will cool off again your\ncandle will be its original color it'll look great and ready to ship so while\nI'm doing that you probably I'm probably not going to talk while I'm doing it\njust because you're not gonna be able to hear me over the gun but what I'm gonna\ndo first is I'm going to heat the top layer basically make that top layer\nliquid I don't want to scorch it because that will affect your colts in throw\nwhen the customer gets the candle I'm basically just gonna liquefy this top\nlayer so that way as those air bubbles rise it's not trapped trapped at the top\nit's got a way to escape then once I do that I'm just gonna slowly work my way\naround the candle just gently heating it up you'll see me using like a sweeping\nmotion with my heat gun that's just to keep from directing too much heat on one\nparticular spot it's only happen once but you can't act to me anyway but you\ncan't actually crack your container especially if it's not a heat-resistant\nglass which you don't really want to be using anyway for\nsmall candle like this but if you get too much heat on one particular spot for\ntoo long you can't actually crack the glass and that's gonna ruin your candle\nand if it's the only one you got left you have to rework something with that\ncustomer to cover that order but I've been doing I've done this quite a few\ntimes you'll be able to see I'll just be doing a slight sweeping motion but this\nmuch frosting I may have to do is do what I can the first round let it cool a\nlittle bit then there might be a spot or two that I have to touch up but\nbasically it's going to go like this okay I've got that top layer heated up\nwithout burning it now I'm just gonna work my way around you should be able to\nsee the little air bubbles going up here just a minute I can see them starting to form you\nmight not be able to see it in the video yet you can see them starting to form there it's not all those working way up to the\ntop yeah that's that pretty good I'm gonna\nwork my way around now and see how they kind of see those air\nbubbles on their way up there's all that frosting leaving your candle there's notice I'm careful not to stay\nin the same spot for too long okay that's basically it you can see how\nmy candles darkened up quite a bit on me it's gonna light and as it cools like\nthey always do hopefully that wasn't too boring to watch I don't think I'm gonna\nfast forward it when I edit it just so you guys can see the whole process of\nwhat I do let's think of the look at the top real quick you see how it's kind of\njust melted the edges you can see those bubbles coming up this candle is wide\nenough to where I don't have to worry about too many issues if you're doing a\nsmaller candle like the four ounces that I make you can actually it'll look like\nyou got a big melted candle wax with a little boat it's stuck in the middle\nthat can actually you can actually pretty much remelt your entire candle\nwhich you don't want and if you do it too much you can actually get your your\nwick to turn loose depend on how you've glued it and then you basically just\nhave a little votive with a wick floating around in your candle it's not\ngoing to dry right you've pretty much ruined it so you want to be careful of\nthat that's pretty much all we do to fix it you might have seen this thing in my\nequipment video show you what I use it for bought this in the canning section\nin Walmart I've seen them a target as well probably a few other stores these\nare using these are for used when a during a canning I guess to move the\njars around just basically what we're doing now I've got a hot canning jar\nthat I need to move around so let's move just like that\nand what I can do before I set it down I can just lightly just lightly tap on the\ntable free up some of those air bubbles now let's just let that cool once it\ncools all the frosting will be gone it'll be good as new and ready to ship\nto my customer again I'm probably alright so that was the tips and tricks\nvideo hopefully found at least one or two of those useful make sure you guys\nsubscribe to the channel", "ZpbLICGmIis": "hello or even one today no it's not today it's tonight tonight we're going to answer a question about math about okay stuttering measurement how many grams in an ounce okay actually already uncensored well here's the answer okay for everyone's pounds how many grams do you get okay hist equation is answer so one ounce is equal to twenty eight point three four nine five grams well let's make a question and answer it so maybe it will help us to remember that question or health hey here's an example question oh man how much is how many how much is ten ounce okay okay let's answer the question so the first thing that I need to do is to put ten you'll find it from here and multiply it with one ounce because this is amps okay and then you put it equal sign and then how much scrums that because you have ten your life must have two in the right as well okay thirty ten and we multiplied it with the basic formula just like we do with this one okay we do just the same okay tamp apply wait the number okay now to apply once equal to tan tan hours is equal to two 83.4 I'm sorry for 9.5 gram well that sounds of the

Mahalo comm and today we're going to learn how to turn a mixed number into a fraction now it's very simple you just need to remember that you're going to multiply the bottom two and add the top one we're going to constantly go around in a circle so for this one we would multiply 5 times 3 is 15 and add the 2 15 plus 2 is 17 that number goes on top and your denominator stays the same so 3 and 2/5 turn into a fraction is 17 over 5 and that's how you turn a mixed number into a fraction thanks for learning with me today if you liked what you saw and would like more information about related

to the channel so on today's video i'm kind of excited because we are going to be spray painting this bumper here and we are using the harbor freight spray gun with the harbor freights and we are using the rust-oleum paint right here the beautiful sunburst yellow and what's interesting is in this video i'm gonna answer some questions that need to be answered on the web thus the mixing ratio of rust-oleum have an effect on the paint's finish does it affect the gloss does it affect the orange peel lay down on the paint afterwards does it affect how well this rust-oleum paint sprays out this gun with this 1.4 millimeter tip so if you guys are interested in finding out whether the mixing ratio does affect the paint outcome don't forget to stay tuned for the entire video all right since we are limited on time i'm only going to be painting this surface right over here which is a nice flat surface and as you guys can see the bumper has a lot of damage right over here we're not going to get into that for this video for this topic but i'm going to clean this surface up with some soapy water first then we have a scuff pad we are going to use and then finally we are going to mix sand it down with 500 grit sandpaper [Music] so [Music] so we are going to be painting in the garage once again the main thing is the vehicle and the overspray so i'm going to take my car right here and i'm going to go all the way there and park it over there all right guys now that we cleared the area we're gonna clean the garage we're gonna let these dogs out so they can relax and calm down and then we're gonna get to spraying all right guys we got the floor cleaned up we got it wet i put some cardboard under the spray area so we don't get it the concrete nice and yellow like last time so the 500 standing uh grit sandpaper really smooth everything out there was a bunch of small fine scratches here which are eliminated right now right now the main thing is to tape off everything else that we are not going to paint thank you road and track for donating some paper alright guys so the last video i sprayed a bumper i had a lot of orange peel and a lot of comments were saying that i need to dilute my ratio a little bit more and if anything increase my pressure as well in the gun so it atomizes correctly now atomization is when the air and the fluid mix together in this little storm area when you depress the trigger and depending on how well the fluid comes out that's how well it will stick on the panel and how well it will lay down so when you purchase the harbor freight gun you are going to have this manual in here as well and the manual is pretty cool because it has some tips when shooting and what you want to do to better your gun spray pattern so if it's too thick it'll tell you what to do if it's shooting all crazy it'll tell you what to do but one thing that's interesting right over here page nine it is saying that this spray gun is meant for spraying oil-based paint which is crazy because everyone online is saying that you shouldn't spray oil paste oil-based paint because it is too thick for this gun but regardless it says proper paint mixture is essential and yes it is to atomize correctly once again which is right here you want it to spray properly if your paint is too thick it will spray blotchy just like this if it is too fine and not enough paint coming out is going to be too thin so we want to achieve this proper spray pattern spray ratio right over here in order to get a nice finish with as little orange peel as possible also when you guys are spraying make sure you are holding the gun perfectly perfectly adjacent to the panel you are spraying don't use your wrist and go side to side in sweeping motions this is actually what i did when i was laying my primer down and i cut that right away so you want to keep a stiff wrist and just move with the body panel there is a nice troubleshooting chart as well over here so if you are having trouble spraying or you're encountering any problems definitely check this out check this little booklet out comes with the gun definitely something to read through before you start spraying and again if you are having a difficult time it is okay you guys are learning i'm learning we all learn as we go every paint job is going to get a little bit better and a little bit faster so this is the gun i am using her from harbor freight obviously i changed the top because the cup that i bought the gun with did not have a lid so i bought these from harbor freights i do have a pressure gauge and i do have two filters this is the original filter i bought off of ebay and it cracked the first time i was using it so i went to harbor fry and i picked up these cheap filters which i was very hesitant about but so far the last time i painted it came out great so not too bad just make sure you don't over tighten these now again my gun right over here is not reading properly as you can see with the gun disconnected it is reading about 11 pounds so i'm gonna have to factor in that and according to the gun we'll probably be spraying 40 pounds all right guys so the first thing i'm gonna be doing is adding some odorless mineral spirits into the gun we are gonna just clean the gun out by spraying that fluid out i'm gonna adjust a little bit of my fan pattern right over here i'm gonna adjust a little bit of how much fluid comes out of the gun with this and we're gonna get the gauge pressure reading somewhat properly last time i used acetone for this paint job and after doing some more research we are not going to be using acetone anymore odorless mineral spirits is what you want to use there is also mineral spirits but definitely get the odorless there is less oil residue left behind with this one so the adjustment knob on the pressure regulator was always leaking and so i decided to take this out so we are going to be using some of this plumber's tape to put it on the threads so it seals nice and tight gun hooked up we are shooting about 42 pounds on the gun which again with the correction equates to about 32 pounds you see that's running already so that's going to be very very tricky i'm definitely going to turn down that fluid knob right now and that pattern is pretty good but it is a little too thick so i'm gonna turn down my fan pattern just a little bit but this is not good with with paint if it runs like that although paint is going to be a little thicker than this so it shouldn't be a problem turn down turn down that fluid tip again and you want to shoot about six to nine inches from the surface area that looks pretty good so let's throw in the paint let's mix it up and let's see if the consistency is good as shooting just with the mineral spirits so make sure you guys shake this up pretty good i've been shaking it for the last five minutes and then once we get it open we're gonna stir it up for another five minutes we want to make sure we mix everything inside really well and i could feel at the bottom of the paint can there's a lot of contamination and sediment sitting in the bottom so definitely don't skip this step because we are only painting a small surface i've decided we are gonna go about two ounces of paint and two ounces of mineral spirits that's going to give us a 50 50 dilution ratio this is going to be the ratio that everyone talks about spraying 50 50. and i'm not going to be using any of these ratios on these cups i'm just simply losing using the fluid ounces on the cup and judging and going based off of that and that's spill all over the can we are just using some masking tape here we're going to create a pour point for the paint all right perfect two ounces of mineral spirits goes in first let me just pour in whatever paint is here all right guys as you can see i got a 50 50 ratio there you can tell clearly by the color of the paint and the color of the mineral spirit sitting there i'm going to mix that really well we'll pour it in the gun so i'll tell you right now mixing this compared to the old mixing ratio i had this is a lot thinner very much like water consistency what is the viscosity of the paint one way to check is to have a viscosity cup but a cheap alternative is after mixing just raise the stick and count how long it takes how many seconds it takes for the paint to dry drip off the stick so let's try that again we're mixing we're mixing one two three so if you guys are mixing any kind of paint that is one way to find out the viscosity of the paint so again this is a 50 50 ratio with rust-oleum and mineral spirits let's see how it lays down let's pour this through the paint strainer into our paint gun and go from there all right like i always mentioned make sure you put the cap on real nice and tight so it doesn't leak and pour out when you're painting and just mixing this in the paint cup you guys can see [Music] how water like it is so 50 50 ratio guys it's time to use a wax and grease remover which we have already put in a smaller container and we are going to use sharp towels to clean the surface off you definitely want to use a wax and grease remover a dedicated one that is and make sure you use the shop towels because these won't leave any residue behind on the painted surface once we clean the whole area off we are going to use a tack cloth to tack down the surface this is going to remove any dust and extra contamination that is laying on the painted surface this item has a little adhesive properties to it so it lifts and absorbs and reduces static on the paint job now as you guys know from the last video i did put a little plastic tarp on here i do have the floor wet and these things should help eliminate some of the dust contamination on the painted surface so we get a better finish [Music] if we were just to clear coat the bumper right now a lot of those scratches would have been removed and would look really nice but our goal is here to spray the rust-oleum paint with two different viscosities two different mixing ratios and to see how it will affect the final outcome guys at this point it is time to put on the suit alright so now we are ready to paint all right guys so it is about 80 degrees 40 humidity today and that's why we are painting the bumpers now the first coat that i just laid down it came out quick compared to the last time where i was spraying and my dilution was a lot thicker with rust-oleum it was a lot more consistent i felt more comfortable spraying the thicker coats because i felt like i was in more control but right now this thing just came out even as the first coat which was supposed to be tacky kind of coat it applied fairly thick and even but it is a watery and a thin consistency so we'll give it about i don't know 20 to 30 minutes to dry we'll see how fast it dries and then we'll do two more coats i don't want to do five coats like last time as well i just want to do another wet coat the second coat and same thing with the third coat but the first coat man i tell ya there is so much debris already in the paint there's so much dust and i just had clothed it i just cleaned it and it's kind of sad that the first coat is already looking so bad so so far i think it looks okay but let's see what my fans have to say all right guys let's talk about the second coat right now the second coat i thought i was gonna slow down and lay down quicker but i don't know i guess i'm just used to going fairly quick so the third coat we definitely have to slow down the spraying process and get it nice and thick so after the first coat i still noticed all the all the 500 sanding marks were still visible it did dry after 20 minutes we laid down the the second coat after 20 minutes which is good it definitely dries out faster than what i was spraying before and hopefully the second coat covers all those sanding marks because if not then we kind of screwed up we should have did a 600 or 800 grit but we'll see we'll see it's all an experiment we'll see how the coverage will look like let's give it another 20 30 minutes and get the third coat done all right the second coat looks fairly dry you guys can do the touch test where it's still tacky but nothing is transferring over so let's go ahead and do that third coat clearly i don't know if you guys can see there are sanding marks still in here so let's lay down the third coat real thick where's my mask i want to know let's go so so all right i think that's a wrap boys i think that's a wrap that came yo that came out nice thick very very nice i still got some paint left actually so i might do a fourth coat i know a lot of people say don't do more than three coats but uh i might still squeeze a fourth coat in because my first coat wasn't that light and it seems like some areas like right there did not cover well and look at this i think there's a bubble right there in the paint and and then there's a there's some hair right there but overall this coat laid down pretty nice nice and thick hopefully won't give us too much orange peel so i think it came out pretty good let's ask our friend and i know some of you guys might be wondering why i'm not tack clothing between each coat well on a regular two-stage paint that is ideally what you want to do you want to lay down one coat let it fully dry tack cloth it spray another coat but with this being an oil-based paint it's still it's still very tacky and putting that tack cloth on it i think would mess up the paint surface unless you want to maybe wait a good hour or so with the 50 50 ratio and tack cloth it but in my opinion you're better not tac clothing it in between the coats i usually use the gun do the first trigger and just blow some air on the surface to to dust out the area all right guys it's been about 40 minutes since that third coat it looks pretty good there's a lot of contamination of dust a few areas right over here just didn't get coverage from the get-go so i do have some fluid left over i am gonna do a fourth and final coat and we're gonna call it a day on this video because you know as you guys know painting takes a lot of time you guys are just seeing the cuts and edits of what i do but in reality this takes a long time sanding prepping getting the garage ready so i hope you guys enjoy this video don't forget to smash the like button don't forget to comment your opinions and obviously stay tuned subscribe so you stay in tune with what's going on what the results will be whether a 50 50 ratio will be better and give a better result or the next video we are going to be spraying a different mixture on the other side so comment down below what your common mixing ratios are for rust-oleum and maybe we'll spray that mixing ratio on the other side and then we'll compare both of them [Music] so [Music] that's a wrap boys [Music] i'm here for the money [Music] but sometimes", "yFqaGeL6Yb8": "[Music] hey guys we get a lot of tech calls with people asking about mix ratios because it's really really important to obey the mix ratios on your components for instance the Euroclear is a 2 to 1 mix ratio now the easiest thing to do is to think about it in parts and not necessarily volume it has nothing to do with a gallon or a quart it's two parts of clearcoat and one part of catalyst and it's really really easy to wrap your head around if you're using these mixing cups now what we have here is a division on the cup with almost every mix ratio that you would ever want to use and in fact there's one for the two to one mix ratio so we're gonna walk you through it once you find your mix ratio across the top stay within that column now we know we want about a half a quart of paint which this is a quarter cup so we're gonna come up to the five two two one two two one it's simple we pour up to the first five with our first component right there now two two one the math is done for us this is the beautiful thing about these cups now we're gonna come up to the second five and right there we have the exact precise mix ratio of a two to one formula now of course there's more columns here there's a half part and another full part so if you have more than two components like two two one two one half will go up to the next five with an additional reducer so just pour up to the next five and again we've got a precise mixed racial and of course always always blend your components before you pour it into the cup now if you're working on an all-over paint job or a larger project well there's larger tubs again with all the mixing ratios all you have to do is find your column and work your way like you read the book from left to right and you're in there's also caps that you can put on the cups to keep debris from falling in while you're between coats or while you're between sessions so hopefully this has cleared up mix ratios for you and as always get in touch with us on the forums or send us an email drop us a line [Music] [Music] you", "HJ7D-1hi4uE": "how do you mix 42:1 fuel mixture for two-stroke engines like string trimmers weed whackers chainsaws so on and so forth well it's pretty easy its afforded to one mixture now don't be don't be discouraged or run away or stop the video because I'm putting up 120 fluid ounces or whatever I will show you all the possible measurements that you will that you can do right down to cups for mixing four to one fuel mixture right so 128 fluid ounces equals one gallon of gasoline now seeing that it's 40 to 1 128 fluid ounces divided by 40 is what 128 divided by 40 3.2 fluid ounces I'm only going to show you this one time google has conversion doing 3.2 fluid ounces equals 0 of 4 tenths 4 tenths or 2 fifths of a cup now you get go and convert every what you can even get a measuring cup that measures fluid ounces not very useful that's why I'm going to show you other ways to measure the fuel mixture okay ii nonetheless a thousand milliliters equals one liter you can get syringes large syringes and sort of that the mix the fuel if you really wanted to do it that way a thousand milliliters divided by forty is what twenty five milliliters you forty cups is equal to 2.5 US gallons 40 cups divided by 40 is what well it's 1 so you would need only one cup of two-stroke oil per 40 cups of gasoline or 2.5 gallons that is by far the most easiest way to do this you could you don't have to measure out the 40 cups at you know with a measuring cup you can actually go to the gas pump make sure that the gas can is empty and pump 2.5 gallons of gasoline into the gas can because I'm pretty sure that they're not going to give you anything over 2.5 gallons if that's what you're putting it your guests gas can because they're pretty tight about all that stuff so 2.5 US gallons per 1 cup of oil so I'm going to basically the cups is the absolute best way to do this here's a fifty to one filled mixture 50 cups equals three point one two five or a three and an eighth of a gallon so 50 cups divided by 50 you would still need one cup of oil for a fifty to one fuel mixture all right so that's just my little video thing stop for watching stay tuned for more exciting videos on more interesting subjects", "96qTeMDDcB8": "hi everyone in this lecture we're going to talk about word problems now word problems in algebra is something everybody fears because what we have to do is we have to take a text like this and turn into an algebraic problem and how to do that well that can be very confusing sometimes and the reason why it's confusing is because there's a lot of different kind of word problems here I have on the board a mixture problem which is one of the many different types of problems and because there's so many different types and each type has to be handled a little bit differently from the others people get really confused so what we're going to do here is we're going to walk through a lot of these different types of word problems and then we're going to start with mixture problems and as the lecture goes on we'll go ahead and do a lot of different types of problems so you can see how they're all handle all right let's read this one one of the things you need to do when you do mixture problems or any kind of word problems you need to read the problem very carefully so here goes it says how many gallons of a 30 percent acid solution must be added to how many gallons of a 70 percent acid solution to make a 50 gallon Oh to make 50 gallons of a 40 percent acid solution so you read that and go wow I don't even know where to start well there's a very handy little technique that liked it that I like to use and that they can eek is to turn something that is like a text that's very confusing into a graphical representation that makes it really easy to figure out what's going on so when I recognize is that I'm mixing two things together two different kinds of solutions one that's the 30% solution to once it's a 70% solution and that will produce a mixture that is a 40% solution so what I'm going to do then is I'm going to write that this is a 30% solution this is a 70% solution and this becomes a 40% solution all the sudden this problem is not so complicated anymore I cannot clearly see that I'm mixing two different kinds of solutions to produce a third solution with a particular concentration of acid also in these boxes we want to put in there how much of each that we have now it doesn't tell you how much use of this solution and it doesn't tell you how much use of this solution matter of fact that's we're just supposed to figure out but it does tell you that you have 50 gallons of dissolution alright so we put 50 gallons over here so how many gallons do we have here and how many gallons do we have here now if there's two different kind of solutions you're adding and you don't know how much of each you use you typically let X be the amount you have of the one solution and the total - X be the amount you have of the other solution so this you write in X gallons that solution and the total 50 - X be the amount of the other solution and now you're ready to start solving the problem the product of the amount of gallons that you have with the percentage of acid that you have in the solution that gives you the total amount of acid so if I multiply these together I get the amount of acid I have in this solution if I multiply these two together have the amount of acid I have in this solution and if I multiply these two together I have the amount of acid I have in this solution and the amount of acid in this solution plus the amount of acid in this solution equals the amount of acid in this solution so simply put in algebra or in algebraic terms we write 30% times X plus 70% times 50 minus x equals 40 percent times 50 and all we have to do now is solve this algebraically like solving a linear equation to figure out how much of each solution we need all right so now we just use our techniques that we've learned before of how to solve linear equations first of all we change a percentage into a decimal so 30 percent is the same as 0.3 times X plus 70 percent is the same as 0.7 times 50 minus X and 40% is the same as 0.4 times 50 okay now we have an equation that has decimals in it then we don't like decimals so we're going to multiply both sides of the equation by a number to eliminate those decimals and it looks like all I need to do is multiply both sides by 10 because I'm the 0.3 to 0.7 0.4 turn into a 3 a 7 and a 4 so multiply the left side and the right side by 10 of course remember if you're going to multiply something on the left side you must multiply the right side by exact same thing okay let's do that now so 10 times 0.3 is 3 so I have 3x plus 10 times 7 is 10 x plus 7 is 7 multiply that times 50 minus X and 10 times point 4 is 4 times 50 ok now we just simply go ahead and get rid of the parenthesis so I have 3x plus 7 times 50 is 350 seven times minus X is minus 7x equals 4 times 50 is 200 and of course what we do here is remove all the terms with the X to the left side all the terms that don't have an X to the right side so I have these already in the right location 3x minus 7x equals 200 and when we move the 350 over the other side remember we change the sign it becomes minus 353 minus 7x is minus 4x 200 minus 350 s minus 150 divide both sides by PI minus 4 - 4 cancels in 150 divided by negative 4 that gives me X is equal to that goes in there 37 and 1/2 times quick check to make sure I did this correctly 4 times 30 is 120 4 times 7 is 28 hundred twenty and twenty eight thousand hundred forty eight four times four and five is two 140 a plus two is 150 all right I have the answer here so that tells me that I need thirty seven and a half gallons of this solution and fifty - thirty seven and a half which is 12 and a half of this solution so the answer is we need thirty seven point five gallons of the 30% solution and we need 50 minus that which is 12.5 gallons of 70 percent solution so quick recap we read the problem carefully you recognize you're adding two mixtures together one mixture is thirty percent the other mixture is 70 percent and you want finally to end up with a mixture that's only forty percent they tell you that you end up with a 50-gallon mixture they don't tell you how much of each of these two mixtures you have to add so you let X be the amount for the one and the total 50 minus X be the amount for the other when you multiply them together you get two mana facet you needs mixture that should add up to the total amount of hassle when you put the two mixtures together and then else your break will solve for X and you put down your answer and that's how you solve a mixture problem", "4KtyhrP-oEw": "this video is sponsored by nordvpn today we've got an interesting experiment with these two types of metal rods

the main attraction using what we've learned here hmm well this pattern is a little bit distorted but that tends to be the nature of forging the metal near the outside generally displaces more than the metal near the middle plus this isn't perfectly square yet so things are a bit wonky for that reason too now here's what it looks from the side there's not a lot going on here clearly to get the most out of this we want to have the on end or cross-sectional area on the surface of the knife so i have to bring that to the outside somehow there are several ways to do that we've sort of talked about these in the past but let's sort of recap the fairy flip because it's one of the most common ways people might do that in the fairy flip the goal is to get the red area to the outside of the knife so you cut the billet at an angle at even intervals then pull them apart turn them on their sides and arrange them so the red portions are facing up then forge weld these in place into a flat bar my metal band saw it's sort of a hobby level enthusiast type band saw for multiple reasons it has trouble cutting thicker carbon steel pieces accurately which is why i've never really tried this before but the billet is small and we may be okay i'd like to keep the pieces in order so that the pattern doesn't change dramatically on the side by side tiles across the final billet at any rate so when we flip them and arc weld them together we'll clean it up and then forge weld it now if you're like me and you're not like me you're better than me you're smarter than me you're half machine a cyborg you're wondering how this will ever work first we're going to get the bill at red hot then add some flux put it back in the forage at forge welding temperatures and try to press it flat so wrap your metal brain around that [Music] okay okay so shockingly shockingly this has worked now it's time to see if we can forge a solid piece of 1084 steel to the edge here so we can actually make a knife of this thing now anyone who watches knows i've never been able to weld two thin pieces like this on top of each other not ever never see everyone else can do it but not old steve see for him this is something the fundamental laws of nature will not [Music] allow wow that is a really great pattern parts of it are out of focus while other looks in focus until you turn it but there's a crack that opened up on the quench right along that last forge weld no okay universe you got me again good one so for the main show let's try to think about other ways we can bring that interesting cross-sectional pattern to the outside of the blade doing a ladder is sort of a good way you cut down through the billet and the divots on the sides of those cuts become displayed along the top of the billet sort of like i'm drawing out here now the boring area in between the ladder divots will still be visible on the outside surface too so it's not ideal or one can try this accordion type pattern where you grind down deeper wedges across from each other leaving none of the original surface left i.e there's no green so the wedge area becomes the outside of the blade after the flattening the problem is i think you lose partial thickness of your cross-sectional area here because it's not all turned up you know okay let's make a slightly larger chunk of steel this time i'm going to incorporate a solid piece of one-quarter inch by one-quarter inch 1084 steel into the canister for our edge so no more dicey forge welding at the last minute which is where things blew up last time this is a great shot of that square 1084 steel piece that's going to be our cutting edge [Music] so when we etched it on end here you can see that our 1084 cutting surface is right where it should be we may have actually pulled this off we just have to keep it centered from here on out so it can form a straight and centered cutting edge for our knife and to help with that we're actually going to grind away some material on either side of it so that it can stay as wide as possible while we squish down the rest of the [Music] billet now it's time to grind in our first ladder pattern and smoosh it flat [Music] so everything is right where it should be so we're going to do a second ladder pattern a finer ladder pattern and we'll see what that looks like after we smoosh it flat oh man we narrowly avoided disaster so i didn't take into full account the fact that when we smash a ladder pattern flat it makes waves and all the steel underneath even our 1084 steel edge core it's not as pronounced as it would be because we did some grinding away of the sides in that area a bit before smooshing it but had we not done that our cutting edge would just be wandering all over the place and it really wouldn't be usable we wouldn't have a straight surface to make a knife edge with so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you've probably noticed there's an up sloping tip at the end of the knife and that's to account for our cutting edge having to get pushed far up enough at the tip without making it too narrow back to front by fully forging the tip to the shape so this up swoop will be ground away and our cutting edge will be right where it needs to be all right down to business we're going to grind our profile then set our shoulders with a carbide file on the 2x72 grinder they'll be touched up a tad with the file but it doesn't take much touching up if you use a fine belt on the grinder to to really get things smooth and flush our blade goes into a steel pouch for normalizing a 1550 degrees and then 1500 degrees each time for 10 minutes followed by cooling at room temperature the quench is going to be from 1490 degrees into a medium speed quench oil professional quench oil i have started to temper in stages these days so as not to over soften a blade the published add-on tempering is great i always start there but i take off about 25 to 50 degrees for the first cycle then i work my way up in temperature over the next few cycles to desired hardness and the tables are good but who's to say that my 1084 is the same as the person who put the table together or that they were quenched from the same temperature and start at the same hardness and all that it's my understanding that these things can slightly alter the tempering curve you know how to reach a certain hardness so at any rate i treat it like barbecue you start low go slow type thing i'm putting a thousand grit finish on it before etching i've worked up a wrought iron bolster and the handle is going to be stabilized maple burl [Applause] [Music] you", "bcM5J-wYHjE": "This video is provided as supplementary material for courses taught at Howard Community\nCollege and in this video I'm going to show how to convert between\ninches, feet, yards and miles. Now before we can\nactually do a problem, we have to understand how these four\nunits of measure relate to each other. So let's start with that. One foot is equal to 12 inches. Another way to say this would be that there are 12 inches in one foot. One yard is equal to 3 feet. Now very often yards are expressed in terms of inches. So we can find what  one yard equals\nin inches. We can do it this way: if one yard \nequals 3 feet and each of those 3 feet has 12 inches, if we multiply 3 times 12 inches, we should get the number ofinches in\na yard. So 3 times 12 is 36. That's going to be 36 inches. We've also got miles. One mile is equal to 5280 feet. So these are some facts\nthat you should have memorized. So when you get a chance, make sure\nyou commit them to memory. Now let's go on to a problem. Convert 4 yards to inches. \nHere's how I'm going to do this. I'll write 4 yards. I can abbreviate yards\nas yds, and just to make this clear, I'm go to\nmake that into a fraction has a one as its denominator. And now I'll multiply it by another\nfraction. What I'm going to multiply it by is the fraction 36 inches --\nand I'm going to keep that unit of measure -- 36 inches over one yard. Now this fraction equals one, \nbecause 36 inches is the same as one yard. When my numerator\nand denominator are the same, then the fraction equals one. So all I'm doing\nis taking 4 yards and multiplying it by one. Now when I do\nthis, the next step I'll do is cancel out anything I have in common in the\nnumerator and denominator, and both have yards. \nSo I'll cross our the yards the numerator, cross it out from the\ndenominator, and now my denominators are just ones, which means I can just multiply the\nnumerators. That's going to be 4 times 36 inches.\n4 times 36 is 144, and the unit of measure was inches. Now let's do this is second way. Let's convert the yards first into feet\nand then the feet into inches. Let's see if we come up with the same answer. So once again, I'll write 4 yards as a fraction. \nIt's not absolutely necessary. And now I want to convert this into feet. So the unit I want to convert into its\ngoing to be unit I put in the numerator. So let's see: one yards is 3 feet. So I'll have three feet as the numerator.\nI'm converting out of yards, so I'll have one yard in the\ndenominator. So I'm multiplying 4 yards times\ntimes feet over one yard. 3 feet is the same as one yard, some I'm just multiplying by one. \nBut after I do that I'll want to convert feet to inches. Now there are 12 inches in every foot. So 12 inches equals one foot. So 12 inches over\none foot is a fraction equal to one. Now I've got my multiplication\nproblem. I can cross out things that I have in\ncommon. So I've got yards in the numerator and yards in the denominator,\nfeet in the numerator, feet in the denominator. \nAll of my denominators are now one, so I just have to multiply the numerators.\nI've got 4 times 3, that's 12, times 12 again is 144, and the unit of measure is inches.\nSo that's 144 inches. it's the same thing I got the first time. Let's do one more. Let's convert 48\ninches into miles. So I'll start out with 48 inches. I'll make that into a fraction and I don't know how many inches are in a\nmile, so I'll have to convert 48 inches first into feet. So let's see. One foot is the equivalent of 12 inches. So I'll make a fraction with one\nfoot as the numerator, because that's what I want to turn \nmy number into, into feet, and 12 inches is the\ndenominator, that's what I want to cancel out,\nthe inches, and that fraction, again, equals one because\none foot is the same as 12 inches. So it's a\nfraction with the numerator and denominator the same.  Once I get the number feet, I'm going to want to convert\nthat into miles. So one mile -- I'll make that the numerator -- is equivalent to 5280 feet, and  that'll be the\ndenominator. Now let's get rid of inches, which I have\nin both the numerator and denominator. So I can cancel them out. \nWe'll get rid of feet, which I have in the numerator and denominator. We can simplify this a bit more. I've got 48\nas a numerator and 12 as a denominator. So I can divide both of those numbers by 12.\n48 divided by 12 is 4, and 12 divided by 12 is one. And now when I multiply this, I get 4 times one times one mile. Let's put that\ndown here. So that's 4. Mile is the unit of measure I have left. And that's going to be divided by one\ntimes one times 5,280. So I've got 4 over 5,280 with miles as the unit of measure. \nSo let's see if we can simplify this. I can divide 4 by 4, and I know I can\ndivide 5,280 by 4. Let's see what I get. 4 divided by 4 is 1. Dividing 4 into 5280... 4 goes into 5 one time with a one remainder. \n4 goes into 12 3 times with no remainder, it goes into 8\n2 times, and it goes into zero zero times. So I'm going to have one over 1320. I'll have that faction of a mile. Okay, so that's basically how this works. As I said, you have to know\nthe conversion facts before you can do this. Once you know those facts, it's a fairly simple and straightforward process. Okay, take care. I'll see you next time.", "CLvf4FMAUx8": "all right so you've decided what type of audio system that you're gonna design 8 ohms now the question is you've got a whole bunch of speakers and amplifier how do you wire it up properly so you don't damage the amp or the speakers well hey everybody Nick here for snap AV and this how-to video we're gonna walk through the different types of wiring parallel series and a combination thereof as well as the different calculations that you need to understand in order to design an efficient system let's go Dan you started alright in the first example we're gonna take a look at a standard 8 ohm amplifier stable to 4 ohms we're also going to be referring to speakers that will be 8 ohm now in order to wire it in stereo you simply hook up positive positive negative to negative pretty simple right well let's say we want to double up the number of speakers on to this channel as the example we've drawn out here simply wire that in parallel so you'll double up the amount of wires positive positive and negative to negative now can this be done well let's take a look the implications using our calculations all right so here's our calculation to determine total resistance with speakers running parallel we have 1 over R T equals 1 over R 1 plus 1 over R 2 so on and so forth for the number of speakers that you have with R stands for the resistance and we said each speaker is paid ohm so we have 1 over 8 plus 1 over 8 this equals 2 over 8 which equals 1 over 4 to figure out total resistance we simply flip the equation so that equals 4 homes now obviously we said this is a form stable amp so we're good to go in this scenario well let's say we want to add on another speaker can we do it well common sense is going to tell us no let's take a look at the equation to figure it out anyway so we'll add on another 8 ohm speaker this equals 3 over 8 flipped over is 8 over 3 or 2 and 2/3 home now obviously 2 and 2/3 ohm is less than 4 ohms which means will damage the speaker if we damage the amplifier if we add on any more speakers now let's take a look at wiring in series again we're going to use an amplifier that's a dome and for Au Sable now you're gonna find series wiring is rarely ever use but for the purposes of this example we need to show you so you understand now to warrant you go positive out of the amplifier to the positive of this first speaker and then negative out of the first speaker into the positive of the next speaker and so on and so forth down the line out of the last speaker you're going to wire the negative to the negative terminal of an amplifier to close a circuit let's take a look at the calculations to understand the total resistance of wiring it like this all right so here's our calculation to determine the total resistance for wiring in series very simple you add up the total resistance of all the speakers that you're using so since we have one two three speakers at 8 ohm apiece our total resistance is 24 ohms well wait a minute I've got an 8 ohm amplifier here and twenty four ohms there what does that mean well let's take a look at how power is calculated power equals V squared voltage squared excuse me over resistance now in this case voltage is constant our resistance is going up with each speaker there or our power is going down this simply means we're not going to get near as much amplification out of our speakers even if our amplifier is high-powered now knowing all this let's take a look at our third and final example of wiring in parallel and in series again we're going to use an amplifier that's 8 ohm 4 ohm stable now with the combination wiring we're going to run these speakers in series so we'll simply connect positive to negative and again with these speakers now since we're also going to run them in parallel we're going to take the positive terminal of this set of speakers and run it to this channel and connect this this series speakers here then we're going to take the negative terminal out of this speaker and run to the negative terminal the amplifier and then connect this via so now we have these figures and these speakers in series as well as being in parallel now for our total resistance with these being in series we learned that we just sum up the total resistance so we have 16 ohm here and 16 ohm here to calculate our total resistance in parallel as we've already calculated in series we have 16 ohm and 16 ohm we want to do one over RT equals 1 over 16 plus 1 over 16 this equals to 16 equals 1 over 8 now again to figure out the total resistance we just flip the calculations on both sides so R over T higher resistance total here equals 8 ohm now as you can see the benefit is well we now have an 8 ohm speaker load on 4 speakers with to an 8 ohm amplifier instead of running them down to 4 ohms which happened when we ran them in parallel now unfortunately this can get more complex as you get to bigger systems and more speakers and that's where you'd want to use impedance matching speaker selectors now let's say you put a volume control and with a whole bunch of speakers now you did the calculation and your total resistance was 2 ohms well if you look at the back of an episode of volume control you're going to see jumpers 4 1 X 2 X 4 X + 8 X the sole purpose is to multiply the total resistance and not damage your amplifier well obviously if you have 2 ohms and we have an 8 ohm stable amplifier we'll take 4 X as our jumper so 4 times 2 equals 8 ohms perfect for our amplifier well that concludes this how-to video on designing an 8 ohm system we covered wiring and parallel wiring in series as well as a combination of parallel and series wiring in addition to all the calculations and those pesky jumpers on the bond controls if you do have any questions or any issues while you're in the field please feel free to call our tech support team thank you very much for buying with snap AV and as always happy installing", "VKyeYt2og2I": "okay guys Steve small engine saloon again thanks for coming back one of the most commonly asked questions by a customer when they come into a small engine shop is I have a chainsaw I have a weed eater I have a two-stroke engine how much oil am I supposed to put in this thing well thanks to the metric system this is super easy to do this is super easy to figure out yourself what are you going to need to do this obviously you need a jerrycan you need some mix oil unless you're a mathematical genius like me you need a calculator you also need a beer so one thing I have to show you on this before we start these red plastic Jerry cams like this one right here is the most commonly used one for a homeowner it's a five liter Jerry can it says five liters right there there's a line right there that's five liters to the line there's a big difference between where that line is and where you can fill it right to the top where it's overflowing these red plastic jerry cans are actually semi-transparent you can see the level of the gas if you look close enough you can see where it's coming up you want it to the line all of these plastic ones have that whether it's a five liter a ten liter 20 liter they all have that line on there so don't fill it past the line or your ratio is going to be not exactly correct now you need to figure out how many milliliters are in this because mix oil is in milliliters to convert to calculate this properly you have to have them equal milliliters in your oil you don't need to know how many milliliters of gas or in your jerrican your gas can super easy to do 5 liter Jerry can you times it by a thousand a 5 liter Jerry can is five thousand milliliters 10 10 liter Jerry can ten thousand milliliters 20 leader Jerry ken is twenty thousand milliliters so now you know how many milliliters are in this the next thing you need to know is what ratio that you want to mix your gas at now all the new equipment out there all recommend fifty to one mix I personally have always mixed my gas at forty to one just a personal preference of mine there's some old-school guys out there that still like to mix their gas at thirty two to one some to stroke outboard manufacturers out there recommend one hundred to one mix for their out boards so figure out what ratio you want to mix your gas out now you got to pull your calculator Road we're gonna go with the easy one here with the with the regular homeowner on a five liter Jerry can and maybe you got a new chance all you got a new weed eater you know that the they're recommended for fifty to one so how many male leaders are in this five thousand milliliters go five thousand on your calculator you want fifty to one mix in that simply divide it by 50 equals one hundred one hundred milliliters of oil in this Jerry can when you fill it to the line is going to be a perfect fifty to one mix okay if you're like me I want to go forty forty two one five thousand milliliters / 40 because I'm going 42 one equals a hundred and twenty five now you put a hundred and twenty five milliliters in this and it's going to be a perfect forty to one mix now maybe you're a landscaper you mix up a ton of mixed gas at a time maybe you got a lot of equipment on your own you mix up twenty liters of mixed gas at a time let's go let's say we're mixing this old-school we're going to go to 32 to 120 thousand milliliters in that one divided by 32 equals 625 625 milliliters in this jerrican right here when you fill it up to that 20 liter mark is going to be a perfect 32 to one mix okay here's one out work there's no board can right there it says 12 liters on there to that line 12 liters twelve thousand milliliters go twelve thousand on your calculator your outboard recommends a hundred to one twelve thousand divided by a hundred equals 120 120 120 milliliters in that is going to be a hundred to one mix for all y'all Americans out there I'm sorry to say but the entire world is on the metric system except for y'all and that's just one of the reasons right there because calculations like this are just so easy with the metric system before I go I got a couple of little tips here for you just quickly you got an empty jerrycan you're mixing it up put your oil in there first and then when you're putting your straight raw gas in there whether it be right out of the gas pump or whether you got a like a big quantity like this and just raw straight gas for your riding lawnmower put your oil in there first pour your raw gas in there afterwards and then as that raw gas going in there's churning it up it's mixing that mix oil for you if you put your oil in afterwards swish it around make sure that's mixed up good in there the other little tip I had for you was that we all know that the bigger quantity you buy of something the cheaper it is you buy it in bulk it's gonna be cheaper if you know you're mixing up this all the time because you're a homeowner you only mix up five litres at a time this is a little bottle right here 100 milliliter bottle is perfect fifty to one mix in there my one of them little ones use it pour it in there keep that little empty container it's a perfect measuring container now then go buy yourself a big bottle of mix oil and just use that as a measuring container pour it in there perfect you know you got 100 milliliters in there dump it down there good little tip right there so I think that was pretty clear metric system rules man so yeah if you uh if you think that was helpful you like that see that little mark right down in the corner right down there round here somewhere bottom right down corner there's a little subscribe button it says click to subscribe click that doesn't cost you anything super easy Steve out", "qswcnyy787U": "this is question 21 college war is giving us a mixture problem and in this case they give us the equation for the mr. problem but it's worth reviewing the equation because you will often have to write these Kleenex is 10x milliliters of a 10% solution with my one milliliters of a 20% solution so the amount of salt in these will be 0.1 times X plus point two times y and he creates an 18% solution it's the amount of salt in that is 0.18 18% of the total amount X plus y in this case we're given the amount of 20% solution is 100 milliliters and that amount is y so that gives you the equation 0.1 x + 1 - 0 times 100 equals point 1 8 times X plus 100 and we can solve this algebraically but if you have the graphing calculator you can put the left side into y1 21 X + 2 point 2 times 100 and the right side into y 2.18 parentheses x plus 100 graph there in the window where your X going to influence the maximum solution here 100 and I'm going to take a why max of 40 and the graph looks like this and the x-coordinate of the point of intersection will be my solution some the graphing calculator second trace Troy's father for innocent can enter three times on the ti-83 or 84 x equals 25 and it makes sense that if we want to be closer to 20% and 10% the amount of 20% solution will be substantially more than the amount of 10% solution so that seems reasonable we can also do this by hand I have 21 X plus 25 2 times 100 equals 0.18 x plus point 1 8 x 118 subtract 18 from both sides subtract point 1 X and I get 20 minus 18 is 2 equals point 0 8 x divided by point zero 8 and on my cat litter 2 divider point 0 8 is 25 which is the same answer I got using the graphing feature we have a number of options for solving these just make sure you're proficient with your favorite one and come back soon for my next video with math there's always more", "gvaojICThzg": "you before we look at what speak impedance means when connecting speakers we need to note that a stereo - amplifier has to individual amplifies built in one for the left channel and one for the right channel the same principles apply to both amps so to simplify our discussions we will talk about only one amp most stereo amps are designed for speakers with an impedance between 4 and 16 ohms the symbol for ohms is the Omega symbol so you connect the speaker to this amp on the back of this speaker or speaker box it says the impedance is 8 ohms 180 ohms speaker gives a total load impedance of 8 ohms this is what the amp is built for so it's happy if the speaker was rated at 6 times that's also fine as is a single speaker rated at 4 ohms now the fun starts what if you were to connect 2 speakers to the 1 amp if both speakers are 8 ohms and you have wired them in parallel you need to calculate the total load impedance an easy way is to use my speakers in parallel calculator this tells us the total load impedance is 4 ohms the app is built for this so that's fine now what happens if both speakers are 4 ohms the calculator tells us the total load impedance is now only 2 ohms way below the minimum for the amp one way to solve this situation is to Y the speakers in series we don't need a calculator for this as you only need to add the 2 speaker impedances together so 4 plus 4 gives the total load impedance of 8 ohms the amp is booked for this so that's now fine okay so what if you want 4 speakers connected to the 1 app let's say you have four eight ohm speakers wide in parallel the calculator tells us the total load impedance is only two ohms that's not good for the amp if you were to have four four ohm speakers wide in parallel then the total load impedance is even less and there's even more disastrous for the poor amp a solution is to use a combination of series and parallel connections which technically will work but is rarely practical often a better solution is to use a speaker's selector switch with impedance protection these are connected adjacent to the app and all the speakers are then connected to the switch speaker selector switches use one of three methods to provide impedance protection or impedance matching one method is to combine the speakers in a series parallel combination internally this shows you having to figure out the wiring this method also gives full power to a pair of speakers if I mean one pair is selected this method works best for two or four pairs of speakers only it is not used for six or more pairs of speakers speaker selectors which use series parallel switching tend to look like this they have no protection switch the second method of impedance protection is to use a series resistor a resistor normally around 4 ohms is put in series with the parallel speakers remember the total impedance of 4 ohm speakers in parallel it was 1 ohm for ohms in series with 1 ohm gives a total load impedance of 5 ohms which makes the app happy if you have 4 8 ohm speakers in parallel the speaker impedance is 2 ohms 4 ohms in series with 2 ohms gives a total load impedance of 6 ohms which is also good for the app speaker selectors which use series resistors tend to look like this inside there are two high-power resistors and not much else they normally have air vents for when the resistors get hot they also have a protection switch or something similar the switch is used when you have only one pair of speakers switched on this bypasses the resistor and connects a speaker directly to the end the third method of impedance protection uses transformers a transformer basically multiplies the speaker impedance if the multiplier is set to times four then the impedance of each speaker is multiplied by four so if for 8 ohms speakers each speaker would appear to have an impedance of 32 ohms the calculator tells us for lots of 32 ohms in parallel equals 8 ohms all good with 8 ohm speakers you could set the multiply 2 times 2 this would make each of the 8 ohm speakers look like 16 ohms the calculator tells us for 16 ohms in parallel equals 4 ohms no problems however if you have 4 ohm speakers and select times 2 then each speaker looks like 8 ohms and the calculator tells us for 8 ohms in parallel gives a total impedance of only 2 ohms not good however if the multiplier is switched 2 times 4 then each speaker looks like 16 ohms the calculator tells us for 16 ohms in parallel give a total impedance of 4 ohms this is fine for the app speaker selectors which use transformers for impedance matching look like this they mostly incorporate individual volume control for each zone they normally don't need ventilation and don't have a protection switch inside there are individual transforms for the left and right channel of each Zone on the rear of some there is a multiply switch which you set during installation in summary no matter how many speakers you have connected to one amp whether they are wired in series or parallel whether you use any type of speaker selector switch the total load impedance must be above the minimum impedance the app is designed for remember we have looked at 1 amp only in practice the methods mentioned need to be duplicated for each app for more information read the articles on connecting speakers on the website", "PvXjT7rK5Bg": "today James brew said yes this looks like a lesson from school but it kind of is this is a big deal nowadays and I've been thinking about how to present this for quite a long time and so we're going to just start with the old days when I when I was a kid we had an old two-stroke mower probably something along the lines of what Road King would work on yes they had movers backed it and my dad would grabs me gas and a can takes some 10:30 oil in it mix it around and throw it in the more and it would usually smokers get rid of mosquitoes pain and that was okay because the tolerances weren't that high and and I'm sure dad knew what he was doing to is just that you know he didn't he didn't measure so nowadays it has to be absolutely right on the money excuse me and for example it this is deal oil it says 50 to one right and that means 50 to one so these are 100 milliliters and we'll just use a couplet because that's easier for all of us here so we have 100 milliliters times 50 that equals five thousand milliliters or five liters of gas so that's exactly what you need is you need five minutes of gas for every one of these little jokes or one second if you guys have been watching I I carry funnels and measuring devices that are accurate some for bigger amounts like one liter does that mean someone for smaller amounts that these are cough drop containers or okay you know hi yay and you get sick and got these little guys and you get your cough measure your cough syrup and they're perfect they have milliliters on one side and two spoons on the other side or tablespoons on the other side and you take your two-stroke oil not some ten thirty from underneath the bench in the shed your two-stroke oil very good quality two-stroke oil and you measure your gas in here and you made sure that it's fifty to one or so will chainsaws I got it I got a little hollow that I think is twenty forty one and you don't use one gas for the other because one will be too rich and it'll smoke and follow the plug and maybe even ruin the motor eventually so that's what I'm trying to say and I do not mix my gas and big guys like this because I don't use that much two-stroke fuel personally and with all the stuff I do in the summer time so I mix it up two liters at a time and a little guy like this so two liters is two thousand milliliters the nice thing about metric is it actually is easy to use so two thousand right divided by 50 for the steel and I take 40 milliliters of oil in here put it in there with two liters of gas and shake the heck out of it don't just let it sit now another danger this is a big one is that these little guys that people read on here it says to dump into a container of 5 liters of oil I think it even says that mix the entire contents of this bottle with 5 litres of fresh super unleaded gasoline for a fifty to one mix it says it right on here but what happens is people take this and they people don't understand the metric system I think okay I got five liters of gas and they don't this in here but this is five gallons right so you're going to need they're going to be around 200 to one not 50 one on this so it's not just a matter of dumping one of these into here and I've seen bad things happen because people think okay this is the big jug I take one of these I dump it into here and I'm good for fifty to one so anyway when you're mixing be careful but I'll just do one world mixed well next two liters of gas and we'll divide it by 24 so now you need 83 milliliters of oil for two liters now in Canada here before were fully metric which makes it a lot easier because there's no even they sell our gas by the liter up here so you know our mindset now is finally moving over to the metric system although you know mr. Google is pretty smart on yet it was asked him how much oil are you going to need with a certain amount of fuel so all I'm trying to do is say be careful out there mixture gas properly use premium

everything up to about 6.6 pounds and that is equivalent to 3 kilograms so this is a smaller smaller size scale and it's meant for weight for wings small amounts of things it comes with these two pieces which you can turn over and use as receptacles for putting things into way and then when you're all done with the scale that one fits on there and then you can just slide the scale in here and it's kind of like a protective case which is an ingenious idea this scale comes with two double-a batteries so everything is ready to go out of the box you just put in the batteries and you're ready to go it has an on/off button it has a changing your measurement scale pieces button and then it also has a tare button so for the modes you can there are four different modes that you can weigh things in so right now I don't know if you can see it but there's a tiny little G and that means grams then it can go two ounces and as you see it comes out to three decimal places which is really nice and then it's got CT and that is a carat weight and that's used for gemstones I don't have much experience with that other than I know what that stands for and then you have GN which is grain weight and I have zero experience with that and as a matter of fact I had to look that up online to see what GN stood for so grain weight is very small and I don't know what you would use it for I bet most people who get this are going to be using the grams or the ounces I know that's what I'll be using so I want to go over this tear button with you in case you're not familiar with how that works but the tare button does is it allows you to measure things when they're in a vessel without measuring the weight of the vessel so I'm going to go ahead and put that on there and this way is one point four eight five ounces so then I'm going to hit the tare button and it will zero out and so now it will weigh what I'm going to put in the vessel without weighing the vessel so my pen weighs 0.4 ounces so then when you're all done you take the whole thing off and now it's registering a negative number you just hit the tare button again and then you're back to zero so operation is very simple on this there's not a lot of ways to mess it up and before you just so you have a true idea of how big this scale is it is exactly 5 inches by 4 inches and the plate itself I believe is this is going

For newcomers, all those arbitrary letters and numbers are an utter\nmystery; and even many experienced shooters can\u2019t keep track of all the different sizes,\ntheir diameters, and how they\u2019re organized. And every shot size chart or table I\u2019ve\ncome across is incomplete in one way or another. So I figured I\u2019d kick off this new video\nseries with an exhaustive, two-part video guide that covers all of the American shot\nsizes, common and uncommon. I\u2019ll explain the various formulas and naming conventions,\nand touch briefly on what the different sizes are used for.\nI\u2019ll explain some basics and try to keep things easy for newcomers to follow, but even\nexperienced shooters should be able to learn something new here.\nNow, the American shot size system isn\u2019t the only one in the world, but trying to include\nothers in the same video would just be confusing - especially with birdshot, where the same\nnumbers and letters refer to different diameters in different systems.\nA majority of my viewers live in areas that predominately use American shot sizes, so\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover first. Other shot size systems will get their own videos later\non. I\u2019ll get to specific sizes shortly, but\nfirst, some definitions and background: For the purposes of this video, shot refers\nto spherical projectiles fired two or more at a time from a firearm. Shot size is either\nthe nominal diameter of the pellets, or the standardized name representing that diameter.\nNon-spherical shot exists, but I\u2019ve never come across a standard size system for those\nprojectiles, and they only show up in a handful of novelty or specialty shotshells anyway.\nShot can be made from a variety of materials, but I won\u2019t get into that much in this video\nbecause standard shot sizes are the same for all materials. Despite some misleading charts,\nthere aren\u2019t separate size systems for lead and steel shot.\nAs used in firearms, shot can be separated into two major varieties: smaller birdshot,\nand larger buckshot. Both are round pellets fired manifoldly, but they can be distinguished\nby their size, the way they\u2019re loaded, their ballistic properties, and how they\u2019re used.\nThe next video will cover buckshot; this video will focus on birdshot.\nBirdshot is very much the characteristic shotgun payload. Dozens, hundreds, even thousands\nof birdshot pellets are fired simultaneously, and spread out in flight to create a wide\ncloud - called a pattern - that improves the shooter\u2019s chances of hitting small, fast-moving,\nand/or distant targets. The idea is that with the right pattern; a\ntarget anywhere inside will be hit by enough pellets to get the job done.\nThis is the kind of behavior most folks associate with shotguns - sometimes incorrectly so,\nbut more on that in the next video. As the name suggests, birdshot is used on\nall types of birds, along with other small game animals, pests, and varmints; and inanimate\nobjects like the breakable clay discs used in various shooting activities.\nBecause birdshot pellets are relatively small and used in large numbers, the amount of birdshot\nin a shell is typically described by the total weight or mass of shot, usually in ounces\nor grams. When it\u2019s loaded, the shot is measured out by weight or an equivalent volume,\nnot by a specific number of pellets. Ammo manufacturers may give pellet counts\nin addition to the weight of shot, but these numbers are almost always estimates.\nStandard American birdshot ranges from the size of a grain of sand to just below the\nsmallest buckshot in steps of one hundredth of an inch. There are also accepted half-sizes\nthat cut that step to just five thousandths of an inch.\nThat\u2019s less than the thickness of one of my beard hairs.\nAll these birdshot sizes are split between two major naming systems. The smaller sizes\nuse a system of numbers, while larger sizes are designated by letters. We\u2019ll run through\nthe sizes, starting at the bottom with the numbered birdshot.\nThe way these numbers work, the lower the number, the larger the pellet. It\u2019s a little\ncounterintuitive, but there\u2019s a handy mathematical formula that relates these numbers to their\ncorresponding pellet diameter. Simply take the shot size number, subtract\nit from seventeen, and the difference is the nominal pellet diameter in hundredths of an\ninch. Take #5 birdshot as an example. 17 minus 5\nis 12. Move the decimal point two places to the left, and #5 birdshot pellets are .12\ninches in diameter. This formula also holds true for non-integer\nnumbers, allowing for half sizes such as 7\u00bd. 17 minus 7.5 is 9.5, or .095 inches. The numbered birdshot sizes start at #12, which is .05 inches in diameter, followed\nby #11, and #10. Anything smaller than #12 is simply called \u201cdust shot\u201d, though sometimes\n#11 and #12 are also referred to as dust shot. Because of their very low mass, tiny #10,\n11, and 12 pellets are only effective on small animals at very close ranges. For that reason,\nthese sizes are used primarily for pest control, and are often called rat-shot or snake-shot.\nYou won\u2019t see many actual shotgun shells factory-loaded with this tiny shot nowadays;\nbut it does show up in specialty shotshells and pistol cartridges, and the shot by itself\ncan be obtained for handloading. Moving up the scale, we have #9, 8, and 7\nshot. Unlike minuscule #10 and smaller sizes, this\nshot is heavy enough to remain effective beyond absolute point-blank ranges, but still provides\nvery high pellet counts and large, dense patterns that are ideal for fragile, but small or fast-moving\ntargets such as clays or small game animals. Also in this range are #7 \u00bd and #8 \u00bd birdshot.\nThese are the only common half-sizes in the American system, though others can be defined.\nWhen dealing with pellets this small, half-sizes offer relatively significant changes in pellet\ncount, and with the way these sizes are made and used, it makes sense to have these intermediaries.\nSince #9 through #7 lead birdshot is less expensive to manufacture than most larger\nsizes, they\u2019re what you\u2019ll usually find in cheap, steel-based, bulk-pack shotshells\nthat are great for inexpensive plinking and training.\nNext, #6, #5, and #4 birdshot are popular for hunting most upland game, as well as smaller\nor close-range waterfowl. .125\u201d #4 \u00bd shot isn\u2019t unheard of. Some\nreloading suppliers offer slightly oversized #4 shot that\u2019s technically #4 \u00bd. And since\nthat\u2019s exactly one-eighth of an inch, metal balls from various other sources can be repurposed\nas shot. But if you see shotgun ammunition specifically\nmarked as #4 \u00bd birdshot - or 5 \u00bd, or 6 \u00bd - you\u2019re more likely dealing with a different\nshot size system. British birdshot sizes include #4 \u00bd, but that\u2019s similar to American #6.\nAbove #4 is #3, #2, and #1 birdshot. These bigger pellets are used primarily on waterfowl;\noffering the penetration and energy retention needed for big, tough birds like geese, or\nlong-range shots at high-flying game. At .16 inches in diameter, #1 shot tops off\nthe numbered birdshot sizes. Larger sizes still move up in hundredth-inch increments,\nbut the math is replaced by a new system of letters and tuples.\nThe sizes just above #1 are the \u201cB\u201ds. At .17 inches \u2013 what would have been #0\nby the number-size formula - is B shot. After that, we have BB shot at .18 inches, and triple-B\nat .19 inches. If that middle one rings a bell, yes, .18-caliber\nBB birdshot was the original basis for the name and bore size of BB air guns. However,\nair rifles have evolved some since their introduction, and the standard pellet size for modern BB\nguns is 4.5 mm, or .177-caliber. Also, it\u2019s worth mentioning that \u201cBB\u201d\nis often used as a catch-all term for shotgun pellets. If someone uses \"BB\" as a plural\nnoun, as in \u201cI like magnum shells because they hold more BBs\u201d, they probably just\nmean pellets in general, not necessarily BB-size pellets.\nAnyway, above triple-B, there\u2019s no quadruple-B. Instead, things start over with a new letter,\nand we have .20-caliber T shot and .21-caliber TT shot. Then, the letter changes once more\nto give us .22-caliber F shot \u2013 sometimes called triple-T \u2013 and .23-caliber FF shot.\nThe \u201cB\u2019s\u201d and \u201cT\u2019s\u201d are common steel shot sizes for waterfowl hunting in\nareas where lead has been banned. Since steel shot has a relatively low density, achieving\nthe same penetration and effective range requires larger pellets.\nThe biggest \u201cT\u201d and \u201cF\u201d birdshot sizes are also used on thin-skinned varmints and\npredators like coyotes and wild cats. Compared to buckshot, these sizes offer higher pellet\ncounts at the expense of some range and penetration. There\u2019s no handy formula for these letter\nbirdshot sizes, but they\u2019re not too tough to keep track of. Just remember that \u201cB\u201d\nshot is essentially #0 at .17-caliber, then the other two \u201cB\u201ds, the \u201cT\u201ds, and\nthe \u201cF\u201ds follow in the usual hundredth-inch increments.\nThe \u201cF\u201d sizes top off the American birdshot system. One hundredth of an inch above FF\nis the smallest buckshot size, .24-caliber #4 buck. We\u2019ll start there next time.\nAll in all, American birdshot isn\u2019t too difficult to grasp and remember once you see\nhow the system works. Stay tuned for part 2 on buckshot, where things get somewhat less\nstraightforward. For now, I welcome any questions and comments,\nand please let me know if there are any general shotgun topics you\u2019d like me to explain.\nI\u2019ve been planning this new video series for a while, and now that it\u2019s finally off\nthe ground, I\u2019m looking forward to feedback.

door at a house and I can't think of a better way to utilize the door and to shoot it so we're going to test out some stuff that 12-gauge it's a bird shot a double ought buck and some slugs so we're gonna check it out see what can happen I don't expect the bird shot we'll start with bird shot to go through or even close to this is a standard metal door here so we just got some number eight bird shot it's just gonna most likely just hit the surface they're not do much but well see what it does alright being a pretty nice dead oh cool alright let's see what number four bird shot here alright that actually did it more than I expected that's pretty cool nice pattern there alright number 4 bird shot Wow I think I may have penetrated a little bit yeah we'll check well check it out after the double-aught buck here it's a double lock lock I think is gonna go maybe even go all the way through we'll see here so this is the standard double-aught buck suprema nine pellets alright here we go the other side there we're here we're fairly close it had a nice tight pattern let's go check it out all the way through oh yeah I see light so the door doesn't hold up hold up much it is a metal door though Wow look at that the birdshot almost went through there maybe a piece a couple spots there there's just a few few spots where it actually went through maybe one anyways that's surprising that's a pretty it's a pretty decent dip man that's awesome alright well let's see what else we got so next in line I've got the standard slug that one out slug so if it kills a deer what you think what do you think it's gonna do to a door I think it's gonna go through a little hollow point wow they actually made some dents around the side there oh very cool that's surprising okay and last but not least these are awesome these are Winchester defenders so the 1 ounce rifled slug and then they have three double plated but bucks buck pellets so slug with 3 Dunlop pounds very nice let's go check it out actually we'll check it out after wall well we'll just do a variety back here and we'll just kind of the rest the doorway here it might be kind of fun these couple more big shot the brute shots are actually pretty impressive to look at that's it alright so the rest we're just gonna have a little fun with that's cool I'll shoot the people all right this is so much fun let's check it out Wow a double up but it looks like every single one went through that is amazing ever single one went through like all nine pellets look at that gosh that would be some major devastation that kid he managed to get hit by that look at the people well it's people I'm surprised with this birdshot bird shots especially the floor the the number for birdshot room and packs a pretty good impact yeah look at that hole the way through just sistah punch the tree well there you have it a standard door out at the range it was a lot of fun I gotta tell you I'm gonna have a lot of fun just shootin the heck out

sprayed over a variety of substrates a wide range of textures can be achieved from smooth like we see on this phone case to something that's extremely coarse raptor is designed to meet a broad range of interior and exterior automotive marine off-road agricultural and industrial applications it's equally suited for use as a truck bed liner or as a protective floor coating practically any application that you can imagine the abrasion and chemical resistant properties of raptor make it perfect for most substrates including properly prepared bare metal aluminum and galvanized panels om painted surfaces ecoute fiberglass wood and even concrete since Raptors fill shake and shoot it's extremely easy to mix if you're spraying a black kit all you need to do is open a kit take out one of the bottles and pour the hardener to the top of the indented fill line put the lid back on and shake the product for approximately 2 minutes an alternate method is to measure the activator by pouring 250 milliliters of activator into a separate mixing Cup then pour it into the bottle and shake it once the product is agitated remove the lid attach the applicator gun adjust the inlet pressure and shoot if you're mixing a tenable kit there's the extra step of adding the toner each leader will require 100 milliliters of toner so a total of 400 milliliters will be required for attending a complete kit for tinting a solvent base coat system works best but you can use single stage urethane toners as well there won't be much room left in the top of the bottle so you may find it easier to mix the wraptor activator and toner in a separate mixing Cup and then pour it back into the original bottle for the ease of this video I'm going to be using a mixing Cup and mix by volume let's say you're going to mix about 12 ounces of material go to the three-to-one ratio on the cup and pour wraptor up to the three line which is about nine ounces then add hardener up to the next corresponding line which is about three ounces stir the products together pour them into the mixing container attach a shoots gun and spray another option that you have with Raptor is the ability to reduce it 10 to 20 percent and apply it with a gravity feed spray gun once you've mixed the Raptor and attach the gun adjust the inlet pressure on your gun to between 35 and 60 psi hold the gun approximately 24 to 32

one connector coming out use ESC well you can only get a while aid but I don't like them because it's more connectors and it's more stuff to go wrong and the other way is is to put two connectors on here so you would cut one lead off put another connector in series so you go from for example negative there to positive there join that to that and then that one back into this so basically you just cut one off put that onto the negative of the other one and then just link the other two together [Music] [Music] [Music] hi guys it's all done so basically this is what it looks like and to keep things simple basically if you're positive red wire coming out you're a SC go into the positive terminal of one connector then on your other connector black wire negative into the negative and then you destroyed the last two together we just positive to negative [Music] there you go success baby and he's still running on a single battery like a free cell you just got to make yourself up one of

imagine a milkman carries a full 12 litre container of milk he needs to deliver exactly 6 litres of milk to a customer but the customer only has 8 and 5 liter jugs can he measure out exactly 6 litres for the customer while taking 6 litres for himself he can obviously use all three containers in order to get this measurement the story goes this problem was asked to a school child in France around the late 1700s he was so interested in the problem that he went on to pursue mathematics this child was named Poisson and he's made many contributions to statistics so the question for you is can you figure it out how can the milkman measure exactly 6 litres and take home 6 liters for himself give this problem a try and when you're ready keep watching the video for the solution all right we have 12 litres of milk and the other two containers have 0 and 0 they start out with nothing so we're going to pour this milk between the containers and we're going to keep track of how much milk is in each container first we'll pour 8 litres and fill up the 8 liter container so that leaves 4 litres in the 12 eater container and we filled up the 8 liter completely we'll fill up the 5 liter container so we now have the amounts of 3 & 5 we'll take that 5 liter amount and put it back into the 12 litre container so we have 4 plus 5 which makes 9 we transfer the 3 litres from the 8 to the 5 litre jugs we now fill up the 8 litre container from the 12 litre jug so that leaves 1 liter of milk in the 12 litre jug and we have 8 litres filled in the a leader jug we fill up the five liter container from the eight liter jug and that leaves six liters for the customer the milkman can then take the five liters pour back into his twelve liter container and he is left with six and so now we've measured it out the milkman can take home the six liters of milk and he's provided six liters exactly six liters for the customer did you figure it out thanks for watching this video please subscribe to my

let me say two things first a while ago I did a couple of video presentations entitled introduction to shotguns and shotguns don't suck for home defense so today in the interest of brevity and to avoid redundancy I'm going to give some really brief explanations of a couple of things and if you'd like a more in-depth explanation you can watch either of those videos secondly the idea of choosing a shotgun as your home defense gun is in itself debatable that's why you see things like videos called shotgun suck and why I made a video entitled shotguns don't suck for home defense so for today we're going to approach this from the standpoint that a shotgun is what you're going with so that having been said let's get to it the question is birdshot a viable option with which to load your home defense shotgun well to answer that question requires that we ask a few other questions the first one being what is birdshot well let me show you now this is buckshot and that's just a few big pellets as opposed to birdshot which is lots of little pellets this is number four birdshot and this is number eight which you can see is a lot smaller the bigger the number the smaller the projectile so now that we know what birdshot is the next question is why why would you select birdshot in your home defense shotgun buckshot is made to shoot large game like deer that's why it's called buckshot birdshot is made to shoot small game squirrels rabbits and birds so why would you put birdshot in your home defense shotgun there's actually quite a few reasons but the primary reason is because you believe that it will penetrate less through common building materials like sheetrock plywood household appliances whatever and therefore with less tendency for over penetration it has less potential danger to innocent bystanders well that brings us to our two big questions that we really have to answer one is that true does birdshot penetrate less than buckshot through common building materials and two will birdshot give you the desired effect on the intended target well I've got some birdshot let's shoot it and see if we can shed any light on that if you've seen our shotguns don't suck for home defense video you've seen this setup before we have three walls set up six feet apart we have to condense the distances a little bit to fit it all on the range you've got a two by four frame half-inch sheetrock on each side another two by four frame would happen sheetrock on each side there are no studs in here most houses have studs set up on 16-inch Center and if you shoot through that wall you got about a 1 in 10 chance of hitting a 2x4 stud so we've just removed that extraneous variable oh and these are just get the whole thing to fall over our exterior wall is sheetrock on the inside half inch and then on the outside half inch plywood and then some cheap particle board siding and then down here we've got our innocent bystanders now again if you've seen our shotguns don't suck for home defense video you know that big buckshot like double lot will go through this smaller buckshot like number three or number four won't but it's only stopped by the exterior wall it'll go through the sheetrock side of the exterior wall so let's go back to shoot this with some birdshot and see how that compares so we're loaded with 12-gauge two and three-quarter inch one and one eighth ounce of number eight birdshot and I'm going to shoot from the prone so later I can shoot from the kneeling and not shoot through the same holes so you see that that birdshot goes through our first interior wall but not through our second interior wall so it penetrates a lot less than buckshot does however one in 1/8 ounce of number 8 birdshot is a fairly light 12-gauge load let's try a heavier 12-gauge load and see if we get any different results well you can see when we go to the bigger birdshot it easily went through both interior walls but this sheetrock the interior of our exterior wall it had just about no energy left when it got here you can see a lot of holes here but none of these actually go through the sheetrock some of them are stuck kind of halfway in you can feel the lump of the pellet and a lot of them just hit and bounced out there's quite a few pellets laying right here so although this did a lot more than the number 8 birdshot it still pales in comparison to the penetration of buckshot and just to illustrate that I'll reload with double-aught buck and shoot through this wall and see what happens and there you have it the big buckshot like double lot goes through as you saw in the other video the smaller buck shots like number 3 and number 4 don't and as you make the transition to birdshot it goes through even less and when you get to the really small birdshot like number 8 it goes through even less so our first question does birdshot reduced potential for over penetration and therefore reduce the danger Dinis applies damage and the answer is absolutely yes it does but our second question will birdshot especially that smaller birdshot deliver the desired effect on the intended target that's a little harder to illustrate but we'll give it a try so at typical home defense distances and bird shot get the desired effect against the intended target well we've got our favorite target soda jugs and I'm back to the one and 1/8000 number eight shot let's shoot these and see what happened well we proved that was fun but let's try something else that might be a little more definitive so what is a good way to test whether or not at close range birdshot can give you the desired effect on the intended target well we can shoot soda bottles water jugs in ballistic gel and they tell us what they tell us but probably the only real definitive test would be if you got a large animal like a deer and then somehow got it smoked meth and then took it out and shot it with a shotgun well I'm not going to do that but let's see what I can do I've got a ratty old hoodie sweatshirt some duct tape a couple of hearts I got them from the butcher shop not the coroner some pork steaks it's important ribs some frankfurters now in case you didn't know this the skin of most hotdogs is made of an intestine and the contents of most hotdogs probably does pretty well simulate the contents of your intestines yeah and some margarine this will simulate that fat layer we all claim we don't have so let me see if I can put all this stuff together into a target that will tell us something so to start with what I've built here is I've got a pork steak which will simulate a pepper also behind that pork ribs and behind that heart now it's a beef heart but I think we'll be okay and then we'll cover that with our foot and I know that's not four layers of denim but it is there's plenty and of course we all know that hoodlums wear hoodies no that's not where the term put them or hoodie came from anyway we'll also take on these repair centers find the center of our target put that there in about the center so I know the right spot to shoot and we'll go back five yards and shoot it with shotgun now we shot those soda jugs with 12 gauge 1 and 1/8 ounce of the number 8 shot to shoot this meat target I'm going to use the stand gun it's a single shot Iver Johnson 28 gauge this particular load has 3/4 ounce of number 9 shot you can get more powerful ammunition than this but the reason I'm going to use this for this particular target is because this combination of gun and ammunition happens to be the least powerful shotgun I own how'd we do well peeled off all our duct tape unwrapped our heart and our first layer our steak is just pulverized the ribs they stopped most of the pellet some got through and our heart has about eight or ten pellets in it so is that an effective hit you be the judge but remember that's about the lowest powered shotgun I can get so let me make up another one of these and we'll go back and shoot that again with a more powerful shotgun so with the 28 gauge that was marginal now let's go back to the 12-gauge we've got the exact same steak ribs heart targets set up under here and where the 12-gauge we're going back to the 1 and 1 8 ounce of number 8 shot which although more powerful than the 28 is still as 12-gauge ammo goes a pretty light load well before we go dissect our heart I wanted to show you this a lot of the pellets went clear through the heart and into the sheetrock wall now none of them came out the other side so still your wall stopped it but quite a few of the pellets achieved full penetration now let's go dissect our heart and see how that looks well we've got this all torn apart and of course our steak is polarized the ribs didn't stop very many pellets at all and our heart is riddled with shock pellets and pellet holes again that 12-gauge round although more powerful than the 28 is really not all that powerful as 12-gauge rounds go but even with a mediocre round you can see pretty good effect with the birdshot so let me generate one more of these targets and we'll shoot a really powerful 12-gauge birdshot round well I'm out of ribs so we're going to have to make our next shot at gunshot so I got our boxes of margarine actually two thicknesses of them and then some pork steaks to simulate an abdominal muscle wall and then our intestines so let's hang this up and we'll shoot it with a more powerful 12-gauge level so we got our gut shot target set up and I had to fold the sleeve of the hoodie across here to get our layers back and what I'm going to shoot it with is federal 12-gauge three inch Magnum two ounces of number six led birdshot that is not the most powerful 12-gauge birdshot load you can get but it's getting pretty close and we'll shoot from five yards and there's the result pulverized our target blew a big hole in our wall now some of the pellets did go to the next wall but all they did was hit and bounced off after going through our target in this wall they had virtually no power level so what does all this tell us well does birdshot as opposed to buckshot reduce the potential for over penetration therefore reduce the potential for danger innocent bystanders yes but is birdshot going to give you the desired effect on the intended target if you use a fairly powerful birdshot load yes so the bottom-line question is birdshot a viable option in your home defense shotgun and I would say again if you use a fairly powerful birdshot load absolutely yes it is so as always don't try this at home I'm what you call a professional and thanks for watching the birdshot vs. buckshot video", "o9pDIC1nh-M": "what's going on guys alright so this video ended up being way way longer than I anticipated it turned into more of a vlog style video than a review but I promise the reviews in there and if you just want to see the review I'll put a timecode down in the description you can click on it it'll take you right to the review but if you want to watch the whole video that'd be cool too hope you enjoy so I posted a picture on Instagram asking people if they prefer three inch or three-and-a-half inch shells and boy it caused quite a stink we were supposed to have a discussion you've got an angry so we're gonna not talk about it we're gonna be about it we're gonna go right we're gonna go snag some shotgun shells from the local gander and do a little test shall we so from what I gathered from the comments is there's basically two camps and no one's really in between you're either on the side of I shoot three and a half inch shells because they don't make four inch shells or you're on the side of the argument that says two or three quarters enough I only shoot three inch because it's hard to find two and three quarters if you can't get them close enough to shoot with three inch you shouldn't be shooting and that's all well and good I'm not I'm not picking a side but it brings up another point that I'd like to talk about but we'll talk about that in another video we're all in the same team guys just because it's not what you use doesn't mean it's wrong but we'll save that for another video right now we're gonna go to Gander we're gonna snag some shells and we're gonna do some tests all right we have arrived to beady gander go see what they got all right when you got blindsided first three and a half inch two shots 1,400 feet a second 26 bucks the exact same shell that's three inches 22 $5 difference they got Winchester there to shot again three-inch two shots 1550 12 bucks three half-days two shot here we go 17 bucks so about a five dollar difference per box again I think that dude test two different kinds of shells all right we've got our shells look at this nice eco-friendly bag we're gonna go shoot something all right step one of the process is complete I'm thinking we're gonna need some big pieces of cardboard to shoot at the board that we shoot at is really shot up and I want to shoot it a bigger target I want to see all the pellets the whole spread rather than just shooting it a 12 inch piece of paper and you only get to see the pellets that hit the target I want to see you know the full spread of what we got going on so we're gonna run in here to the home depot see what they got for us all right well that was a success we got a big roll of paper three feet wide so we'll probably do like a three foot by three foot square put that on the boards we'll be able to see a lot more of the pellet strikes that should make people happy so I'm gonna go ahead and make a prediction I'm gonna say that the three and a half inch shell is going to put more pellets on target but it's only going to be marginally better than the three inch it's going to be a small enough gap where the three-inch guys are going to say see I told you three 1/2 inch shells aren't worth it you don't need that but it's going to be just big enough to where the three and a half inch guys you're going to say see I told you the extra five dollars is worth having you know however many extra pellets on so I don't think it's gonna change anybody's mind his moon make the argument worse but we're gonna find out nonetheless it is test time all right so we're going to be shaping these bigger targets but for test purposes we're only going to be concerned with what is inside it's raining perfect timing great that is that's exactly that is exactly what I wanted come on I guess we're gonna have to wait this one out for a minute you know what we came here to do a test and we're doing a test don't worry about this rain come back gonna be oh goodness so we're going to cut these into a roughly three-foot pieces okay so after further assessment the chest is gonna have to wait till a later day because it's raining a lot so this is to be continued mmm all right it's a new day the sun is shining and we're gonna do a shotgun shell test also side note I got a drone I've actually had a drone for a while but I've never flown it outside of my house so we made a little bit of drone footage in here too and if you came here not to be entertained but just to learn about shotgun shells well I apologize you can fast-forward to the shotgun shell part but this is my video I can do what I want so ok we're back again this is take two [Music] gonna be shooting at 30 yards see who can put the most pellets in the square and what they're the bigger paper is I just want to see what the entire pattern looks like if there's any major differences here we go Nate who's gonna be helping us Azir protection which one we gonna shoot first first one in line okay that 3-inch two-shot Winchester Hey so we got that was the 3-inch two-shot Winchester matters a little bit high one shot down three more to go well that's been impressed with that I'm not gonna lie so next we'll do the three 1/2 inch Winchester two-shot so this is the three and a half inch this is the three and a half inch Winchester and it is substantially better absolutely worth the extra $5 a box in my opinion for this application I'm interested to see how it compares to the blindside so what's this target out the next will be three-inch blindside still number two shot trying to keep things as fair as possible I think it's better it's better it's definitely better than the Winchester three-inch but not nearly as good as the three-and-a-half so during a half inch blindside okay last one this is one I'm most excited about seeing that is a pretty doggone good package blindside that was our square one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen we got 14 inside the square and a pretty good pattern overall little behind left but they were all like that now this is the 3 inch blind side 1 2 3 4 5 yep 5 on the 3 inch blind side still a decent pattern not nearly as dense as the Korean half 3 inch Winchester 1 and I will count that one will count that one mm close three of them in the square with the 3 inch Winchester the three and a half inch Winchester I miss my square up a little bit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 we got 15 on this one there in the Blind Side that's what you get what the paper looks like on the back that's a solid pattern that's what it looks like on the back of the blindside so those are two three and a half so three and a half inch Winchester did fifteen three and a half inch blindside did fourteen three-inch Winchester did three kind of three-inch blindside did five so that pretty well settles it for me you can make your own mind up I would say there's no other conclusion that you can draw from this other than you should be spending the extra five dollars on three and a half's if your gun will accept them so I hope this video helped you leave me a comment down below let me know if this changed your mind at all if you're gonna stick with threes if you always been shooting threes or maybe if you're gonna accept your going to move up to three and a half's or maybe both shot three and a half's and this just confirmed what you thought but anyways enjoy some drone footage and while we were down here we figured why not break out the fun guns [Music]", "F8zxG_djKhE": "hey guys if you've ever had questions\nabout how to mix clear coat while we're going to show you exactly how to\nproperly mix a catalyzed clear code system because it's really important\nthat you stay within the manufacturer's recommendations on the mix ratio now the ratio has nothing to do with\nvolume it's not about volume it's about parts so think of it like this two parts to one part the euro clear is\ntwo to one ratio two parts clear one part catalyst here's how to utilize these mixing cups\nthey have multiple ratios across the top these cups are fantastic tools and\nthey're very very accurate so basically what you do is start at the\ntop find your ratio and then just like you read a book work your way from left\nto right so are two to one ratio is across the top like we said and we know that we want about a half a\nquarter clear so here's our line and the five has nothing to do with the volume\nthe five is just the number that were chasing so our first column here is our\nclear coat before are clear into the mixing Cup up to the five now just like\nwe read a book left to right our next is the one ratio\ntwo parts clear one part catalyst so we pour the catalyst up to the next five\nand that's it no more mixing into your spray gun you get an accurate mix into\nthe mixing Cup every time now even though euroclear has a two to\none mix ratio you have the option of an extra part of producer or a whole part\nof producer for extra flow out if you're dealing with hot temperatures high\nhumidity or if you want to flow

fourth grade he will decompose fractions 3/8 is a fraction we can compose 3/8 in two parts using a tape diagram as the visual model 1/8 plus 1/8 plus 1/8 equals 3/8 your child will write this as an equation these are called unit fractions he will also decompose 3/8 as two eighths plus 1 eighths decomposing fractions into different parts helps your child to understand that one whole can be expressed in more than one way sometimes your child will work with improper fractions ten fourths is an improper fraction because the numerator is greater than the denominator your child will decompose an improper fraction by considering the denominator and pulling out one whole four fourths equals one whole after pulling out four fourths 6/4 remain but wait he can pull out another whole

now most of these products that Artful McGuire's are all DeLuna bulette that means is they can be diluted and mixed with water so instead of just buying one gallon of it that one gallon can be stretched out into multiple gallons for detailing now this means that this product is going to last me a lot longer than say a regular diluted product that's already purchased like a consumer product the professional products that I've got behind me I'm going to show you how to dilute them and how to get them ready for spring so behind me I've got a couple of McGwire's products that I was talking about now all of these are from the detail of professional choice series of products that McGuire sells now all of these you can pick up on amazon online and in most stores that sell detailing products like this now these products can be diluted however those some of them that can't like the leather conditioner and cleaner from McGuire's cannot be diluted these synthetics spray wax cannot be diluted the quick interior choice detailer cannot be diluted but most of the other ones can now the way that you know which ones can be diluted and which ones can't there's gonna be a little sign on the back that's going to show you the dilution ratio and it's going to say either ready to use or you're gonna have an option and it's going to show you two different numbers so like five to one four to one 128 to one so like for the shampoo Plus that I've got right here the recommend dilution rate is 128 parts water to one part of the cleaner the soap right here now can go down to the next one this is the glass cleaner concentrate and this can be diluted ten parts water to one part of the cleaner now this means that this one gallon of this cleaner is going to make eleven total gallons of sprayable glass cleaner now when I'm detailing a car say the engine bay I want a degreaser that can break down and strip of all the grease inside the engine bay so I'm left with nothing but a pure clean engine bit when I do that I'll be using the McGuire super degreaser now I'll be diluting it four parts water to one part in this cleaner in this bottle I've got one liter of total fluid that can be put inside of here so that means if I'm going to be diluting this four to one I'm getting mixing 200 milliliters of the solution and then the rest of this I'm going to be filling with water now the same thing goes with the ten to one dilution ratio and I'll be using this for say cleaning leather and softer stuff I don't need something that will be breaking down thick gunk now in an engine bit you're going to have about a quarter inch of gunk lying around the engine bay you want something strong to take that down if you're going to be cleaning leather seats you don't need something that strong you're only working with little body oils inside the leather and that gets trapped inside of it now for that I'll be using ten to one super degreaser now to do that inside this one liter bottle I'll be putting a little bit less than a hundred milliliters of the cleaner inside the 1 liter ball now I'm going to show you exactly how I do this calculation how I find out how much to put inside of here all right so I'm gonna bust out my trusty iPhone calculator to do this now inside this bottle I'm going to be mixing and diluting the super degreaser right here to make a cleaner for leather that's safe so the ten to one ratio so it's ten plus one total parts okay so you have eleven and it's ten to one so you're going to be bringing that one and bringing that over the eleven so that's the ratio for this mix now if you're going to be multiplying this mix to the entire bottle so this is one liter so I'm going to be doing a thousand milliliters so out of this entire bottle ninety milliliters of this is going to be this straight super degreaser concentrate so ninety point nine milliliters of this is going inside of this bottle and the rest of that I'm filling with pure water so just to show you if I was going to be doing the other mix for two one this is how I do that calculation so four plus one so five total parts and you're going to bring one over that five one over five and you're multiplying this by the total concentrate or the total size of the ball so times one thousand milliliters two hundred milliliters of this inside thing is going to be the pure concentrate and you can do this for any dilution ratio you can make and you can make this 10 2 1 5 2 1 4 2 1 3 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 if you really wanted to but again this is good for engines this is good for leather and you can work out any kind of other concentrated mix for whatever product and application you're doing so to get started remove the top got a funnel put it on top of here and because of mixing this 10 to 1 we just saw that it's ninety point nine milliliters of the straight concentrate so over here on the side it's going to be right underneath this line now if it goes over it's not the end of the world but that's if you wanted a straight if you wanted a pure ten to one ratio you're going to want the level right there as you can see it's right underneath the line let's put that aside and then your be mixing the water into the solution so get a jug of water and just fill this up until it's full now just a little tip the slower you pour this the easier this is going to be because you're gonna have less and less bubbles forming as you can see if you put it in too fast it's going to start bubbling like this after you fill with water put the top back on turn it upside down and then mix it so the entire thing is shaken up and you've got the same consistent mixture through it now as you can see after right here we've got our sprayable ten-to-one super degreaser inside this bottle and if we put this up to the four to one you can see that it's a little lighter of a color and it's going to be not as strong as a cleaner as this now this is perfect for leather as I said earlier and if you want something stronger like something to clean the underside of a car or an engine bay or whatever you're going to move to something stronger like this now you guys can use this exact same technique for any of these products right here you can dilute them to whatever ratio you want but don't forget to make sure you calculate it so you the right ratio if you guys have any questions regarding this video please post them down in the comments below and I'd be happy now ok guys thanks for watching I'll catch you guys in the next", "IxDpQB6iVY4": "\u266a\u266a\u266a My name is Ronnie Coleman and\nI'm an 8-time Mr. Olympia and current IFBB pro, and I'm\nhere today to tell you guys more about my training,\nnutrition and supplementation. \u266a\u266a\u266a Real quick before we get\ninto that, let me tell you a bit more about me. I got into bodybuilding and\nI did it working full time as a police officer. \u266a\u266a\u266a It kind of goes\nback to growing up. When I was a kid, you know, my\nmom pretty much had a strict regimen that we followed. Before she went to work, she\njust laid out everything she wanted us to do\nbefore she came back. When we went to school, we had\nto come home and do our homework right away, you know, before we\nwent out and played and stuff. If it wasn't done\nwhen she got back, you was in a lot of trouble. A hard head makes\na real soft behind. Just been--just followed\nme all throughout my life. I've been training all my\nlife and I had a pretty good background in just training\nbut, you know, not training as a bodybuilder but just training,\njust to keep in shape and training for football and\ntraining for the college team and that kind of stuff. I went to college for 4 years\nand got my degree, it was a BS degree in accounting and kind\nof graduated with honors and everything, so I was at\nthe top of the class. Couldn't wait to get out\nof school so I could get a job in accounting. So I'd go out and I'd\nput in probably about at least a thousand resumes. I'd get called on some\ninterviews and the thing that they wanted most, I didn't\nhave and that was experience. So I was bored so a\nbuddy of mine said, \"Oh, I'm going to Dallas.\" I'm like, \"Okay, I'll go out\nthere with you 'cause I ain't got nothing to do at home.\" So I get to Dallas and I'm\nlike now, you know, I ain't got nothing to do so I need a job. Finally got a job, you know,\nworking Domino's Pizza part time and stuff. I figured that I'll just\nstay there until I can get a job in accounting. So cut to the chase 2 years down\nthe road and I still don't have a job in accounting, you know? And I'm thinking,\nthere's something wrong here. I used to get the paper every\nday and the only job that they had that you didn't have to have\nexperience was a police officer. I used to have a buddy\nof mine, he's like, \"Man, you need to apply.\" I'm like, \"Dude, that's the\ncraziest job in the world.\" It didn't sound so crazy after\nlike, you know, 2 years so I just broke down and I applied\nand I was hired probably about 3 months later. I've been out on calls where,\nyou know, before I got there, you know, there was a big\nargument going on and the people yelling at\nscreaming at each other. And then all of a sudden, I\nwalk up and they look at me and they stop, right away. And then the focus is on me. \"Man, you're pretty big.\" Yeah, a little bit. I didn't know anything about\nbodybuilding when I got into it. Weightlifting, I try to tell\npeople all the time, it was like a hobby for the and the reason\nwhy I started because people used to always ask\nme if I worked out, and I used to always say no. I got to the point where\nI got tired of saying no. I'm like, if they ask me why I'm\nworking out, maybe I should work out and see where it can\ntake me so that's why I started working out. It was all a stepping stone\nto where I am today. It took me about 8, 9 years of\ndieting, training, working full time in the police department\ntrying to organize all this with a family. And first we had to get, you\nknow, out of the amateurs, then we had\nto get to the pros, then we had to get\nestablished as a pro. And then we had to get good\nenough where we could, you know, win a Mr. Olympia. \u266a\u266a\u266a Yeah, buddy. \u266a\u266a\u266a I try to train every body\npart about twice a week so I'll try to train like 6 days a\nweek, spend about an hour, an hour 15 minutes a\nday on training alone. And if I'm getting ready for\na contest and stuff like that then, you know, it's another\ncouple hours a day of cardio. I take Sundays\noff, 1 day a week. My rest day is like, you know,\nget up early, about 9, have a little bite to eat, go to\nchurch, come home, take a shower and stuff and get\nready for work. People always ask me how do you\nbuild muscle and how do you get strong and all\nthis kind of stuff. It's two different things. I did both, you know, I was a\npowerlifter and when I was a powerlifter, we only did, you\nknow, like a few reps at a time. And we'd like do like, six, four\nand two, something like that. That was to build strength. But to build muscle, you know,\nyou do a lot of reputations like 10, 15, 20 and that's\nhow you build muscle. It's all\nlightweight to me though. It wasn't a big transition\nbecause I only did powerlifting for about maybe 2 or 3 years. Now when you got like 800 pounds\nof weight on your back, you ain't really thinking\nabout no competitors. You thinking about trying\nto got the weight off ya. Every rep, that's what you\nbasically thinking about. I've always wanted to train with\na partner if it's somebody that can, you know, challenge\nme and do the same weight that I'm doing. But if not, then I\nrather train alone. Coming up, you know,\nwe pushed each other and it worked out\nreal good for us. So I much rather train\nwith a training partner than to train alone. I like to tell people just, you\nknow, do it like I did it and get a personal trainer and that\nway you know what you're doing. You're doing it the\nright way and you're not going down the wrong way. You're not wasting your time. \u266a\u266a\u266a If you don't have the right\nnutrition, you're not gonna grow and I learned that the hard way\nbut I learned it in a good way. When I was playing football and\njust doing stuff like that and not actually trying to get\nbig, all I did was eat like hamburgers and fried chicken\nand all that kind of stuff. And I was wondering why I wasn't\ngrowing any muscle 'cause I was eating a lot of food, but I\nwant eating a lot of good food. Protein is what build muscle but it's gotta be good,\nquality protein. I try to eat about\nsix meals a day. What I try to do is get like\n2 grams of protein for every 1 pound of body weight. I try to take in about 600\ngrams of protein a day, like 100 grams of\nprotein per meal. My mass building muscle\ntechniques are chicken, steak, and turkey. It's a strict diet and we\ndon't deviate not one bit. Nutrition to bodybuilding is\nwhat an engine is to a car. If you don't have the\nright nutrition, it ain't gonna\nfunction properly. Just like a car, if you ain't\ngot an engine in it, it's gonna be kind of hard\nto drive around and get to where\nyou're trying to go. \u266a\u266a\u266a Without supplementation,\nyou can't do it. When I first started in\nbodybuilding, we didn't have as many supplements\nas they have today. We were just basically taking\nstuff like aminos, protein and you can't get not 1 ounce\nof muscle without protein. You kind of like, you know,\nlearn with the curve as time went on. Of course, you got pre-workout\ndrinks and post-workout drinks. You got your nitric oxide. It gives you a, you know, a good\nboost before you get in the gym. It gives you a good pump\nonce you get in the gym. It gives you a little\nbit of motivation also. It just got better and better\nas I've gone on year after year. My top three are basically\naminos, protein, creatine, basically are your main ones. Bodybuilding is all about\nbuilding muscle, who got the biggest muscle, who\ngot the best muscle and who got the most\nquality muscle. I don't think I could have\ndid bodybuilding without supplements, matter of fact\nI know I couldn't have done bodybuilding\nwithout supplements. Yup, you need to\nget the right one. That's the key right there. \u266a\u266a\u266a Whoo! For my full training,\nsupplementation, and nutrition program, check\nout the page below.

I'm Beth Somers from the Wilton\nTest Kitchen and I want to show you how easy it is to cover a round cake with\nrolled fondant I have my round cake all set up here\nready to go it's on a 10 inch cake board and I have an\n8-inch round cake so you want to put it on a base that's at least 2 inches larger than your\ncake and as you can see it's very level all the way around that's\nthe first thing that you need to know because then we can ice it very nice and\nlevel so I have buttercream icing here at a thin consistency which is the perfect consistency for icing a cake and you're\ngoing to spread it onto the cake just like you would if you were just icing it normally\nleaving it as a buttercream iced cake you want to make sure that you\nget it as even as you can it doesn't have to be perfect\nat this point but as even as you can because the more even it is the more even\nyour fondant will be over it so I'm using my angled spatula here and making sure my\ntop is nice and flat and I have a normal coating of icing here a normal amount so if you prefer a\nquarter inch a half an inch that's what you should do: okay so that\nlooks good because it's nice and flat now I'm just going to move to\nmy sides once you have your cake iced the next thing to do is measure the\ntop and the sides because that's how you're gonna figure out how large of a piece of fondant you need to roll measure the height of the cake\nmultiply that by two and then at the diameter my cake is just\nabout four and a half inches tall and eight-inches' across so that's how I\nknow how big I need to get now you're going to take your fondant out and begin to knead it you need to knead until its pliable before\nyou start rolling and the new decorator preferred fondant\nas much softer so it actually goes very quickly that's\nreally all I need to do. my 20-inch roller and I'm going to simply roll it out most projects will\ntell you to roll to about an 1/8 of an inch thickness and I'm using my Roll-N-Cut mat here as you can see if\nyou're just doing this straight on the countertop you might want to put some\ncorn starch or confectioners sugar underneath the fondant to prevent it\nfrom sticking you can also if you like pick it up and move it like I'm doing once in a while so\nthat it doesn't stick kind of like pie-dough like that you want to\nmake sure that you're always rolling from the center outwards and never fully over the edge of the fondant so that it remains consistent all the\nway across and again we're going for an 1/8 of an inch thickness it's better to start with a circle because it's easier to finish with a\ncircle if you start with something that's really misshapen it's harder\nto get it there now I'm just going to cut the fondant to the size that I need eight inches by four\nand a half inches I'm going to need about a 17 inch circle\nafter you get your fondant cut to the size that you need rolled out and\ncut going to want to make sure that your cake is ready before that because the\nfondant will go on right away you can't let it sit out too too long or it starts to dry out so\nwhat I've done I've just loosely folded the fondant over my rolling pin once just like that\nand what I'm going to do is start at about an inch away from me so that the fondant in the back is touching the base and gently roll my\nrolling pin out like that so that the fondant will drape\nall the way over the cake now you can see it's draping nicely and\nit's covering completely and from here we're going to use a\ncombination of our hands and the fondant smoother tool to gently adhere the fondant to the\nicing underneath and then start pulling the fondant away from the cake as you use your hand to slide down it to get rid of any creases so always pulling down away\nand down from the cake as I go so that the\ncreases actually come past the edge of the cake so that\nthey're on the cake board itself as opposed to on the side of the cake\nthat's the trick just to continue pulling and smoothing down and this fondant is really stretchy\ndecorator preferred fondant works really nicely it also drapes really\nnicely over the cake so it's very very easy to do this cover rotate the cake as\nyou go so that you're always able to see the part\nthat you're working on and just going all the way around\npulling it out and smoothing it down don't worry if you have a a few little\nlumps we're going to go back with the smoother at the and after everything is adhered so I've gotten almost all the way around\nand here a lot of people have problems this is the tricky bit it's adhered on both sides and then\nthere's this flap it's okay just pull it out one more time you're going to loosen\nit a little bit on either side there from where it was\nattached and just pull it again a little bit more so that all of that\ndraping comes to the bottom of the cake and then over onto the cake board itself see there's\na pleat here but there's nothing here so now what we\nwant to do is take our smoother and go all along the top and the sides to\nget a nice clean finish and you're going to go all\nthe way to the  cake board here to create a nice tight adhered fondant if you get the bubbles in your fondant\nyou can use a pin to insert a pin at an angle very\ngently to release the air and then just smooth\nback over it that'll happen once in a while and then\nI'm going to use my fondant trimmer here to very carefully go around the cake I have one little seam there so I'm\njust going to go back and resmooth it out get rid of it I'm a little bit of a perfectionist and cutaway the excess fondant as close as you can to\nwhere the cake meets the board again making sure to turn the cake as\nyou do this so that you can always see where you're cutting and I like to do it in smaller portions\nrather than go all the way around in one big strip because sometimes the fondant might stretch you don't want that to happen so tiny little strips is my\npreference and there we go all the extra fondant is off of the cake and just one more time we're going to go around if you have any buttercream on your board I have a\nlittle bit wipe it up before you do your final smooth so that you don't\nget anything on the side of your fondant so one final smooth just like that and there you go that is how you cover\na round cake with fondant", "55QL7na9kvQ": "man look I'm as excited today about what we're gonna do is anything I've done in a while it's winter time late winter here in south Louisiana and the fishes just not the best right now it's going to get a lot better soon but right now it's just tough well a great thing to do in the off season is to figure out what your lures look like underwater we all kind of wonder that as we're fishing right you wonder what are the fish seeing what's making fish hit what's making them perhaps not hit well getting some lures on a swimming pool will teach you a lot about how your lord looks when you do certain things with the rod not only that but how different weights of jig heads and and different lures look differently underwater well today we're going to show you some of that I'm gonna put some GoPros in the pool I'm as excited to learn what you're gonna learn today is anybody because this is going to teach me as much as it's going to teach you and I can't wait to do it so what we got here is a long punching rod got braided line on it nice and strong and what I did is I tied it to a stick inside of a traffic cone on top of the traffic cone I have a clamp with a GoPro I'm gonna lower this into the water and that will provide us a great perspective on how these lures look underwater now look this pool hasn't been used in months it is loaded with leaves it looks like a swamp but at least the water still clean so that's going to tell us all we need to know I'm excited to do this I really can't wait alright so I got the camera on I'm just gonna lower it into the water [Music] [Music] I guess the hardest part is going to be getting it angled correctly yes it is there we go perfect all right that's gonna work it's gonna work well [Music] here in south Louisiana everybody fishes soft plastic paddle tails with various jig head weights very popular weight is 3/8 ounce because it really kind of works well in depth of 10 feet or more maybe even eight feet or more but I've definitely found over my career that lighter jig heads work better in certain situations so I really want to see how a bait looks differently underwater jig depending on the heaviness of the jig head so I'm starting with the 3/8 ounce jig head this is a limbo sliced colored matrix shad one with a real bright color bait so you could see it underwater so let's see how it looks [Music] all right so obviously we're we're recasting right now is about four feet that's not exactly real-world if I was fishing for feet I would never go with the 3000 you can see how that beach is barely hops off the bottom this is how my rod motion would be if I was fishing this bait I would not be moving at much at all I'd just be kind of crawling it [Music] all right so what everybody knows is that fish tend to bite a lure on the fall so you want that lure falling as long as possible and slowly as possible so it's really tantalizing on the way down so I'm gonna do I'm a cash right in front of the camera lens so you can see this bait as it's falling and see how good it looks and that's the look that you really want so now we're gonna see how differently the lure looks we put this exact same bait on a 1/8 ounce jig head all right so here we go with the 1/8 ounce a lot lighter jighead let's see how it looks in front of the camera okay one thing that immediately jumps out at me and I wasn't expecting this this bait is falling so slowly with this 1/8 ounce weight that the tails not even flapping on the way down I almost kind of think that's gonna hurt you [Music] look at that it looks almost like a dead stick just falling down on the water with a lot less tail action now a positive is that when I do retrieve the bait it stays up and falls much more slowly so there is a longer duration of the fall than with the 3/8 ounce but the tail action again is just not as good even on those Falls the initial fall as well as the hops all right so my research is definitely paying off and I got to tell you my hypothesis is proven to be a little bit inaccurate because I thought what was going to happen is that this law is gonna look a lot better on a 1/8 ounce than a 3/8 ounce and it really kind of doesn't it doesn't look as good now the fall rate is a lot slower and there will be times obviously that's going to help you but I like that tail action on the 3/8 ounce and you know this dissipate in general has a great deal amount of tail action so it's not like it's just a stiff bait that needs a lot of weight to make it move so still it's going to be some trial and error with fishing locations obviously you never want to throw a twenty thousand in swift current areas or in very very deep areas and I have had fishing trips where we did much better on on lighter jig heads than on heavy jig heads but I don't know I think I kind of sold the 3/8 ounce short a little bit I'm uh I'm more client to use it in the future even a little bit shallower water alright so it wasn't planning on doing this I was only going to do an eighth and a 3/8 but my mind is so blown I want to see what happens on a quarter ounce so we're gonna go right in the middle with a quarter ounce weight and see how that changes the motion of the bait all right first cast with the quarter ounce I'm truly excited to see what happens here Wow okay not a lot of tail accident on that either definitely better than the three than the one eighth but not like we had not like we have with the three eighth not at all really really slow fall and look let's be honest it's not only the tail action of a bait that attracts bites it's also how you work it but that tail action definitely can be a difference maker on tough days [Music] okay so let's see if the next axiom is also this Peru everybody knows breed has no stretch Manos got a lot of stretch so when you're fishing with parade a slight movement of the rod tip it has a big impact on the bait fishing with mono you can be much more whippy with the end of that rod it's gonna have less of an impact on the bait so I'm going to make casts with braided line of course I got a fluorocarbon leader tied on gonna make some other cast with monofilament and see how the motions of the right tip impact the bait underwater you [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I think I know what that footage is gonna show but I'm gonna discover it when you do I can tell what I'm feeling here when I'm fishing definitely that mono is way spongy err but how much does it really affect that bait underwater all right the last pool check is gonna be weight of a jig head under a cork I am a big believer then use an extremely light jig heads when fishing under a cork because that bait falls so much more slowly looks much more like a shrimp and I think almost all the time speckled trout and redfish even bass and our coastal marshes I think they think they're feeding on shrimp even though what we're throwing them our paddle tail soft plastics you want it falling as slowly as possible but I really want to see I'm excited to see how quickly these baits fall with the various jig heads so what I'm gonna start with here is a quarter ounce really nobody fishes a 3/8 ounce under cork if you do that's really overkill but I got a quarter ounce here what I generally fish myself is a 1/16 ounce so I want to see the difference and how that looks underwater let's go check it out [Music] [Music] [Music] man that was so much fun I learned a lot just even watching the Lord's in the pool but I really can't wait to get home and check out the footage now obviously I had one of my tenants of my fishing philosophies kind of blown or at least I think I did I'm gonna get home and see if I did but another one was absolutely confirmed no doubt in my mind fishing those lighter jig heads under corks is a lot better now guessing the underwater footage is going to show that this bait was producing no tail action on this one sixteenth ounce jig head look at that jig that's tiny ooh tiny but I don't think it matters because I think again that the game fish in our marshes or thinking that that is a shrimp not a minnow or Kruk or anything trying to get away from they think it's a shrimp have you seen a shrimp falling in the water column it doesn't have a whole lot of action at all just Falls and then every now and then it'll pop and that's what happens when you pop the cork it that bait jumps up and it just barely falls you got that heavy jig head on there it's going down much more quickly yeah you might have a little bit of tail action but I think that slow fall in the water column is that what really inspires them to feed my philosophy anyway I'm gonna get home and see what all this shows well that's it hopefully you enjoyed

picadillo to start i have one pound of lean ground beef and i'm going to put it in a cold pan turn on the heat and start to break it apart and saute now you can fill your chimichangas with what you like chicken beef pork it all works i'm going with picario today i'm adding a half teaspoon of onion powder a half teaspoon of garlic powder i'm also going to be adding a quarter teaspoon of cracked black pepper and give it a mix and continue to cook the ground beef and the ratios of all of these seasonings and ingredients are up to you so now i'm going to add half of a small onion that i've diced give that a mix and saute i'm also going to be adding half of a small bell pepper that i've also diced and one medium potato that i cut into small cubes a quarter teaspoon of salt mix and saute for about five minutes now i'm going to add two cloves of garlic that i minced and one tablespoon of beef bouillon powder be sure to mix continue the saute for another minute or so now i'm going to add just a little bit of ground cumin about a quarter teaspoon it's really optional and up to you now i'm going to add three quarters of a cup of water give it a mix i'm going to cover with a lid lower the heat and cook until the potatoes are tender and once my picadillo has cooked this is for chimichangas if you're using this for burritos or tacos it's not the soupy kind i want to make sure that the water sort of evaporates and cooks out and really the water is just to help the potatoes cook along but this is what you'll end up with i'm going to set it aside and let it cool for a little bit and now i'm going to work on my flour tortillas now if you want the recipe for homemade flour tortillas i will link the recipe video below or somewhere above this video now i'm ready to put my chimichangas together so my picario has cooled off it's sort of like room temperature it's slightly warm here i have my flower tortilla you can use store-bought the burrito sized and i'm just going to add a couple of scoops of my filling so i'm going to tightly wrap and roll this and it's ready now you can deep fry this you can freeze it i have other chimichanga recipe videos i will link those below but today i'm using the airfryer so i'm just going to brush oil on the exterior of my chimichanga i'm going to place it into the air fryer and i'm going to set the timer for 15 somewhere between 15 to 17 minutes at 400 degrees fahrenheit in the meantime i am going to make the chile con queso so i have a preheated pan over a medium low heat i'm adding a half tablespoon of unsalted butter i'm going to melt that down a little bit now i'm going to saute one jalapeno this was a large one and i removed the seeds and i just diced it you could also use a can of rotel in place of all the fresh ingredients but this really does taste pretty good now i'm adding one tablespoon of finely minced onion and one clove of garlic one medium roma tomato that i've diced and just continue the saute now i'm going to add a quarter teaspoon of smoked paprika you could use regular but the smoked really tastes good and an eighth of a teaspoon of onion powder now continue to combine and cook now i'm going to add eight ounces of velveeta cheese this is american processed cheese i'm also going to add four ounces of sour cream i'm also adding a half cup of whole milk and now over a low heat i've sort of turned it down you'll want to just melt and combine everything until it is smooth and creamy just like this and it's done okay so at this point my chimichanga is done and you can actually do this in the oven as well if you want to do several at a time i've deep fried these before which also works but before deep frying i do like to freeze them seam side down but today i opted for the air fryer so now i'm just going to smother this in this delicious chile con queso and this will be lunch for my family and the recipe that i made today will definitely give you somewhere between four to five [Music] chimichangas [Music] i hope you give this recipe a try i hope you like it and thanks for watching [Music] you", "HaqL9RAIyLI": "hi everyone this tip is all about the time signatures of 12 8 6 8 & 3 8 so 12 8 it look like this 1283 8 & 6 8 time signatures so as you might know by now if we have a 4/4 time signature this 4 on top means 4 beats per measure and this 4 right here means the quarter note gets one beat the quarter note gets one beat so if we have 12 8 3 8 + 6 8 these aids still stay the same but the but the beat count 12 3 & 6 are all changing so it doesn't really matter what time signature you play this no value of 8 all stays the same 12 beats per measure 3 beats per measure and 6 beats per measure so if we were to count 12 8 it would sound like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 this is what they call compound meter compound meter as you can see come here there we go when I'm counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 I'm not snapping 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so all these beats are kind of like grouped together in one big snap 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so same thing goes for 3 8 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and the same thing goes for 6 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 so we're all at is that like I said before 12 8 3 8 6 8 these beats all changed so it's either 12 beats per measure 3 beats per measure or 6 beats per measure but these aids mean the eighth note now gets one beat okay let me actually rewrite this again 12 8 3 8 6 8 so in 4/4 the quarter note gets one beat but in either 12 8 3 8 or 6 8 the eighth note gets now one beat so that changes everything for our note values so if I write all my note values here starting from the eighth note here eighth note gets one beat now and we're basically just doubling everything eighth note gets one quarter note now gets two beats half note now gets four beats and the whole note gets eight beats but what if we were to add in those dots next to them like either add on an eighth note a dotted quarter note dotted half note or dotted whole note remember our definition from a couple videos back dotted note means you add half the value of whatever no you're you're putting it two dotted half note or excuse me dotted quarter note half of 2 is 1 2 plus 1 is now 3 and now for the dotted half note half of 4 is 2 4 plus 2 is 6 beats and the dot dotted whole note 8 plus 4 half of 8 is 4 8 plus 4 is 12 beats so we have a lot to work with in all these time signatures either 12 8 3 8 or 6 8 but in 3 8 we definitely can't use a dotted half note or a dotted whole note we can only go up to a dotted quarter note all right so six-eight we can go to dotted half no we can go to half note here but we can't use a whole note or a dotted whole hold on we're got the whole note in 6/8 we definitely can use all of this in twelve eight okay so all three of these have all these note values but you just have to be careful on how many beats are putting in every single measure depending on what your time signature is okay so so what all this means is if we were to put everything together and I were to put a rhythm pattern let's say and I'll just put twelve eight just as an example if I were to put twelve eight and I were to add twelve beats here so let's say I were to do a quarter note that's two beats plus an eighth note plus a dotted quarter now so here we have two beats plus one beat that's well coffee hasn't kicked in yet - B's foot won't be a three beats and plus another three beats at six beats okay so we need another six beats here we'll go and dotted dotted half note so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve if I were to clap that sounds like this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve one two three one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve so that's twelve eight here I go four three eight if I were to change that now we have three beats per measure so we have we can choose between an eighth note here and a quarter note that's two beats there two three pretty easy right 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 this is kind of like if you are going to kind of like speed it up a little bit it's like it's like riding a horse like one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two three one two right so if we were to do 66 eight here uh we have a little bit more to choose from let's go quarter note and I'll just put half note just be simple here one two three four five six one two three four five six here we have two beats and here we have four beats one two three four five six one two three four five six so the reason I'm counting all the way up to six is because we want to keep that consistency there so if we were to diagnose the counting okay so this gets two beats we're going to go one two three four five six two beats here and four beats here 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then when we're done with all of that all we just we have to do is just write another measure line and then we're on to the next one so that's basically at 12 8 3 8 6 8 every note value changes and it's basically doubled from 4/4", "KrM5U2kGQCc": "hi I'm Roy Huntington editor of American handgun ER magazine a lot of my readers are really concerned about self defense and home protection basically defending their families of course in these crazy times I think it's wise to at least be thinking about those things a lot of people have bought a short-barreled defensive shotguns lately in order to defend their home a lot of my readers asked should I buy buckshot should I buy slugs should I buy birdshot I'm just really confused can you help me now keep in mind this isn't a comprehensive training video about how to effectively deploy a shotgun in a combat situation all I want to do is give you just a real quick look at the basic differences between buckshot which in this case is nine pellets about 32 or 33 caliber my left hand I have a typical two and three-quarter inch number eight shot 12-gauge something that you would go dove hunting with now which one is most effective in your home defense shotgun a few things you need to keep in mind buckshot will penetrate just like you were shooting a 380 automatic or a nine-millimeter it'll penetrate multiple walls inside of your house more than likely now if you live alone and out in the woods then that may not be a problem but if you have family members in the house or neighbors who are close by over penetration is a serious problem and something you need to think about and that's maybe where birdshot is a good option birdshot since it's very small bb's tend to under penetrate now that doesn't mean they're ineffective against an unprotected bad guy we actually took buckshot and took number eight shot and shot it at a target that was about five yards away what I want you to pay attention to is the fact that at close range they're virtually equally effective now granted you can argue that the buckshot may be more effective because it'll penetrate better and I won't argue the point with you but if you're concerned about over penetration you're concerned about other family members in the house being armed with 12-gauge shotgun loaded with number eight birdshot will absolutely protect you and your family okay we made these two shots at about five yards and this is an old Remington 870 police trading shotgun and it's got a cylinder bore so there's essentially no choke whatsoever it's pretty short barreled and it's pretty typical of a lot of the home defense type shotguns that you buy nowadays made by Remington or mosburger but not only anybody like that well we've learned here is we have number eight birdshot here and then we have double-aught buckshot over here what I'm trying to show you here is the fact that at five yards which is essentially across the room if you're using this as a defensive shotgun this is actually very significant and you'll see the majority of the shot are clustered right in here and this is what's called a rathole effect wound this is where a large portion of the shot actually went through causing a very significant wound over here of course you have the 32 33 caliber pellets that have spread out in a little bit of a distance this may be more effective for you because it does cover a larger area and at these distances both would be very lethal and would more than likely stop any threat that you had so if you have a sporting shotgun there's certainly nothing wrong I feel to use birdshot of some kind at close range home defense situations the additional advantage of that is the fact that the birdshot generally won't over penetrate and won't pass through two or three walls the buckshot being solid lead 32 or 33 caliber projectile tends to really

papa herbs this is some weed for some people with daddy issues I'm just kidding but I mean Papa herbs there's 14 dollars and it's 916 percent THC I mean I just had to pick this up first of all because it was $14 an eighth and I didn't really want to spend so much on weed where it would be gone the next day this is just I'll smoke out my friends they'll know nothing better I'll obviously it's just some alright weed you know but saves me money and I get to buy some wax as well so definitely saving in that regard you know if I would have just bought like a $40 ate I wouldn't have enough for this so now I have to I have flour in this and it feels like popcorn mugs already and you must be real but if it's good popcorn nuts I won't complain people complain about popcorn it's gonna get smoked regardless but like alright let's just open this you got this lemon cake guys so just see what this is and I looked at the [Music] so before I start this I looked at their Instagram and I seen there grow off and all that stuff and it's definitely like not bad like this stuff is actually pretty decent looking up on them Wow hey I mean you're gonna get what you pay for but this kind of looks like better than what I pay for you know like it looks pretty decent basically I'm gonna start this again after this is done rolling I'm going to be using the curved papers but you know in love but I feel like this is just gonna be a weed review not like I'm gonna stop rolling on here because I don't roll that good and I don't want to be you know I'm so keen on saying so I've started again hey guys so I just thought I'd start the video again just because I broke this up and it smells like pretty good flour like $14 what the [ __ ] are you sure guys are you sure I mean that [ __ ] looks fire for poking up weed alright guys so we got the joint rolled not too bad and yeah I definitely see myself buying this before going on road trips because my friends won't know the difference you know I'm rolling it and it still tastes pretty good and obviously you know there are better options than this but for $14 you can't really beat it you know don't let's just burn off this extra [ __ ] right here extra extra [Music] I didn't see anyone I'll let you know though y-you stay over here okay I'll let you know hey no problem [Music] it's a bit windy guys drum roll her throat Boyan before I start this video I'm at Randy's house he's about to come out and about to go eat after so don't worry [Music] there we go [Music] [Music] yeah no problem say yes guys just smoking this this is actually really Pleasant smooth honestly $14 not bad they had a hella in stock guys so if you guys see this video you know and you don't want to spend too much on lead but you want to buy a lot of weed and just smoke you know and it's good weed it's club weed it's all a [ __ ] I'm for herbs man this ateva [Music] and and some people like my friend included calamity he loves popcorn hugs and if people can get high quality popcorn uggs for cheaper I'm pretty sure a lot of people would you know because when broken down it all looks the same from the fat note to a small note you know obviously fat notes are gonna have more it's gonna be more potent I guess but only by little you know that the popcorn nugs they're still there you know got a guy showed up to the popcorn eggs feeling that's why they call it popular or a store for sort of pop the popcorn herbs I don't know very nice little packaging not the best part packaging but very miniscule minimalistic very nice [ __ ] with it you know papa herbs honey I don't know if anyone's done it another video on YouTube on this specific brand but if they've done it they probably were pleasantly surprised just like how I am today so [Music] it's actually not bad guys this is like it's like I'm not saying buy like the cheapest dirt weed you can get I'm just saying some people can't afford the [ __ ] lavish $60 Apes you know and you know I could afford that too but I would much rather smoke some of this and then get some wax you know just get more for your buck than just [ __ ] one eight you know and you know if you are one of those people that can buy Apes like that more power to you you know I'm saying this is not a game of signing off on people you know I'm I'm just smoking you know I'm showing you well I think it's good and if you're trying to save some money to get some pubs they also have their Instagram right here and all of you guys been asking for flower reviews and all this stuff and uh from time to time I'll do them but I'm not going to break the bank or break my wallet for a 60 dollar eight just to review you know so hope you guys can understand there's a reason why there's so many levels of cannabis like lows mids and tears because not everyone is rich not everyone can afford that much in a I've gotten slack for making a video on spending a hundred dollars at a dispensary and I've been laughed at and it's like so what so what if I spend a hundred dollars like that's a lot to some people and that's nothing to some people you know and then there's people in between where you know it's they do that every now and then like honestly it shouldn't even be about that you know it should just be about chilling smoking and yeah I like this product part gonna see more of this on the channel if I do get it only bought this because I needed some nuts to do a rosin press and I the homie Justin say he was gonna provide the nug for me but you know sometimes you just I don't know do it yourself you know like I like I appreciate the homie for offering his nug but if I could buy 1405 I bought it you know already $14 for this eight I have some weed know to do this video on and it's not a rosin press video that I can show you guys it's actually for something else but I can tell you guys about it you know they but this lemon cake is pretty good it is a nice mellow not as potent sativa in the morning it is at 16% and it that's pretty good for a $14 eighth 16 percent THC suck honestly you it probably would have been like 12 at another club 12 percent I'm liking it though liking it I also picked up some apex I was gonna pick up some ghost rain haze apex but they had the last one and it wasn't it was the display one and I learned my lesson I only want to get the ghost train haze because I've seen it in one of my top 10 sativa videos and I've never tried this train so I wanted to get it but I learned from my past mistakes I'm not getting display backs ever again and it's nothing I mean don't get me wrong it still got me high when I got that display wax but I feel like it could have got me higher if I would have got it when it was fresh you know so good smoke guys honestly I'm pretty [ __ ] tired but hopefully you guys enjoyed this video so far it's just a Papa herbs Papa herbs you know I'm saying this is the one so yes guys I think my camera's probably gonna overheat pretty soon so I'm just gonna stop it before that even happens great for Papa herbs check them out Instagram is going to be under this right here at yeah right here so yes for those of you who are looking for cheaper alternatives to bring with you to share instead of sharing I mean obviously it's good to share the good stuff too but you know it ain't cheap so if you want to share this stuff it's pretty good I suggest I highly suggest it $14 is where it's priced where I'm at so definitely going to be you know it varies different from where location and even [ __ ] dispensary be sure to check out all your alternatives and I'll see you guys in next one [Music]", "nSoL-R7KHD4": "[Music] hey guys so last time we talked a little bit about the theory behind and making a toner for our hair after we've big steel or lightened it and at this time I want to go into the kind of Practical behind it and actually show you how to mix a toner and it's quite basic but there is a few little kind of like nuanced ways of making it that kind of different from other color so I'm going to go through that today and now first thing we need is developing lotion you can buy it in just about any cell supply shop I don't know about regular kind of hair stores but you can definitely get it and any salad supply shop something like Sally's or something like that you need 6% they come in different strengths you get three six nine twelve percent for today's purpose between 6% then I'll go into a little bit more about that whilst we're actually mixing and by only six percent of that or 20-volt they come in different most of them will say both of the ways of measuring it but it's either six percent or 20 volume and yeah that's the same thing six percent or 20 volume developed knows you need to color that you can use permanent tube I've got gold well today it doesn't matter if it's gold well or not that's just what I use and it needs some scales we need to set scales just to be quite precise with our ratios and it is quite important and and you'll see why in a minute but and it's not just it's it's best to use scales if you've got some needs it's a little jug or something you can put some water rinse on the end of the world and you need a brush and a mixing bowl and that's pretty much it for all the things you need and so yeah what I'll do is I'll get on to show you how to mix that now a little bit about through the boys we mix it the way we are what we're doing that okay so first thing we want to do is you got the scales and we've zeroed it with the mixing bowl on top of them now the ratio we're gonna do today is we're going to use one water one color for one developer takes one two one two one now and the example I use is 10 mil because I'm just going to right away so I don't need that much so what I mean by one to one to one is we can use 10 mil of water ten mil of color and ten mil of developing ocean now by using 6% developer so first we stick that in and then I'll carry on sorry so there's a ten meter wall there now we're going to use 6% developer now the purpose of using 6% developer and mix it down with water is that by using one to one of developer and water what we're doing essentially is we're creating a 3% developing nation because we are diluting it one to one with the water so by diluting with the water we're actually creating a 3% now 6% for lifting hair 3% for depositing tone so you could you can ask the question so why don't you just you know use a 3% developer to start with and the answer is the reason that I wanted to show you this video like this and that's the answer there is that you get a much it's much more fluid it's much more watery it's the consistency is just not so cake mix like and and when we're making a toner that's incredibly important because when we're making a toner we need to get it on as fast as possible so the point to get in with the water one of the big bonuses of using it this way is in six percent and then bringing it down to three percent with the water is that we are allowing it we're making a much more watery consistency and then when we're putting on our hair we can do it much faster somehow I'm losing the millimeter every time I'm doing it so we're just going to carry on now in ten mil of color to that be honest normally I do it the other way around but I want to show you the the consistency of the lotion or this it's not such a big deal so it's fine so yeah ten mil up the color to that and then just give it a good stir together and that's basically on such stirred up that will be our timer now this is a bit of a pig to mix in with the water and such but you just got to keep going and keep going because once you start breaking it down it will mix in with the water completely because you don't want it to have those you'll start to see in a minute it will get quite stringy but you don't want that you need to get it quite consistent to be honest using a brush it's not the best way I had I adapt I don't have any little kind of egg whisk things that we use to hand at the moment so I'm using a brush but it does work so it's fine yeah if you can get a tip to use as those if you get those espresso mixes and little kind of expressed our egg mix egg whisk type things there they're really good for this but yeah I don't have one hand at the moment so I'm choosing my brush but yeah so we're gonna we mix it all together and then say that one to one to one with the water it just really helps it to get a better consistency to put on your hair because when you're making a toner as we said in the last video you need to get on as quick as possible now if you're doing it without the water and just using a 3% developer with one to one with the color it's it's much it's it's it's less less runny so it becomes much more of a chore to get it into the hair and then but with the water as well you can really just throw it on the hair a lot quicker and that's a great help when you're trying to get it on fast so that's pretty much it we've mixed our toner so that's your toner really and then you just bang out on the hair as fast as possible now it's unlikely that you're going to be using one color for a timer so obviously you need to mix that with your own mixture first and in terms of amounts now you take 10 mil of each 10 mil color 10 mil of develop an urgent mo of water that and probably do someone's hair that's about my links but I don't really want to give you exact numbers of what you should be using for your own hair because it's very difficult it really depends on what your hair is like if you've got porous hair you'll need more longer hair you'll need more obviously but what I will say is you probably want to overshoot and because you don't want to get halfway through the all the develop on all depending on the hair to find out you've got to mix up a load more and do the other half of your hair so it's better to overshoot the number shoot when you're making a toe nose I know it's a waste and it's a bit of a shame but it is definitely better to overshoot we do with your amounts then under shoot okay that's about mixing at the time it really it's quite simple say it's just one one one one two one two one say so ten mil to mil and ten mil or if you're making more it's like 40 mil of water 40 mil of color forty minute developer so it's quite easy to remember and it's quite easy to do best of luck if you have any questions feel free to get in touch me in the comments below or you can visit my blog at lemon soda hair calm there's my email and then get in touch me down always happy to answer emails I've also got Twitter lemon soda hair and and yeah I hope you have it's helpful please subscribe and thanks for

more try a complete lesson today at your teacher comm here we want to find the mean median mode and range for the data set let's begin by finding the mean remember that the mean of a data set is equal to the sum of the set of numbers divided by how many numbers are in the set so to find the mean of the data set shown here let's begin by adding the numbers so we have 15 plus 24 plus 49 plus 8 plus 50 this will be divided by how many numbers are in the set which is 1 2 3 4 5 adding the numbers we get 146 146 is divided by the number of numbers in the set or 5 146 divided by 5 is equal to 29 point 2 so the mean of the set of data shown here is 29 point 2 next let's find the median remember that the median is the middle number and the data set when the data set is written from least to greatest so let's write our data set from least to greatest we have 8 15 24 49 and 50 so the median will be the middle number or 24 next let's find the mode the mode is the number that appears most frequently in a data set notice that each number in our data set appears only once so there is no mode finally let's find the range the range is the difference between the greatest number in the data set and the least number in the data set which in this case is 50 minus 8 or 42 so the range of this data set is 42", "3Kt2MnrJPKo": "[Music] when tile installations required durable proven protection

That\u2019s a liner. Birthday carp, bosh! Got him! Yes! Heads I\u2019m in the best swim,\ntails you\u2019re in the worst swim, yeah? It\u2019s got to be a better one,\npulling like that. These German carp are just so cool. And the biggest one so far,\nreally accurate, minimal disturbance. Ooh, just seen one out there,\nlong and... Yes, get in! I love it when a plan comes together. The heavier baiting\nis definitely working. Absolutely nailed\non that size 4 Long Shank X. Get in there! I\u2019m absolutely blown away. We\u2019ve been very fortunate to be invited\nto Bj\u00f6rn Brockmann\u2019s syndicate up in the north of Germany,\nabout an hour north of Hamburg. And we picked this place\nbecause it\u2019s very representative of what you would fish in England, what you would fish in France\nif you were going on holiday and loads of other club and syndicate\nlakes right the way through Europe. It\u2019s about 20-25 acres in size. Average sort of depth,\nsort of 3-10 foot and a stock of about 160 fish. The biggest of those,\nthere\u2019s definitely one 25-kilo fish which is a 55-pounder. And probably 8-10 fish over 20 kilos\nat the right time of year, which in English money\nare 44-pounders. And loads of other 30s. I\u2019ve seen from filming that\u2019s been done\nhere before, they\u2019re stunning fish. Everyone loves the German carp,\nmyself and Darrell included in that. Whether they\u2019re 22lbs or 44lbs, I\u2019m sure\nwe\u2019re going to love catching them. Right, heads I\u2019m in the best swim,\ntails you\u2019re in the worst swim, yeah? - Go on, you call it, bruv.\n- Heads. Tails. I\u2019m going to be good to you\nand I\u2019m going to go in here because I know you really want\nto go down there, don\u2019t you? Honestly, I was like, I thought\u2026 - You really\u2026\n- No, no\u2026 Come on, you really want to go\ndown there, I know you do. Be honest. I\u2019ve got a bait boat, I could probably do better in there than\nyou could without a bait boat. - Only because of the pylons.\n- Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean. There\u2019s pylons going over the lake.\nI fished here before. I think this swim is a very good option\nfor the long\u2026 Obviously, there\u2019s fish here now\nbut you\u2019re always in the middle. And I think that\u2019s a great option\nfor the week. - Whereas I think that\u2019s a great option\n- Now. five minutes after I drop my bait, and the wind is going to blow there\nfor a day or so so it should be\u2026\nYeah, I think I\u2019ll catch there and then we will see what happens. Go on then,\ngo and get your little black swan. Got my puppy feet. Swim choice wise\u2026 Oh, just seen one out there\nlong in front of where I\u2019ve chosen. That\u2019s nice. Swim choice wise, I knew Darrell\nwanted to fish down the other end. There are so many fish down there,\na big pack of them. You can tell because he gets all jittery\nand starts looking and he gets the fire in his eyes. So I knew he wanted down there and I get first choice a lot of the time\non these things. So it\u2019s obvious\nthat a big pack of fish are there, but there\u2019s a big pack of fish in front\nof where I\u2019ve chosen as well. And they say all your battle plans all\nchange on first contact with the enemy and I was planning to fish longer and fish lead clips if I could,\nfish wafters. The fish are here\nand they\u2019re really close in. So I\u2019ve got rods that I had tackled up\nfrom Embryo Norton Disney on a shoot last week. They\u2019ve got helicopter rigs on,\nlittle pop-ups. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to flick out\nto start off with and see how it goes. That\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve got three rods out. The left-hand one has gone out\nto my left-hand margin. There\u2019s bush there,\nsaw a couple of fish top and on the echo sound on the bait boat\nit looked really clear. I\u2019d also plumbed it with a marker rod. It\u2019s a difficult cast,\nthat\u2019s why I\u2019ve used the bait boat because the wires over the top\nwere a little bit much, but I\u2019m on it. It\u2019s gone down with a solid bag and it\u2019s absolutely bomped down\non the bottom really well. I\u2019ve got quite a bit of bait around it. The middle rod is really long\nwhere this morning\u2019s activity was. There was loads of fizzing,\nloads of topping going on out there and it just looked like the place to be and the right-hand rod\nis down my right-hand margin. Again, there\u2019s a little bit of bubbling\nthere this morning. One fish topped and I\u2019ve just cast out\nwith a light lead and Spinner Rig, kept casting till I got a good drop and then just sprayed\na few boilies over the top. They\u2019re in the water, I\u2019ve done the best\nthat I can and there were fish about. It's just a case of whether\nthey\u2019re still there or not. Well, the first day\u2019s\ndrawing to a close. I\u2019ve been racing against the light as is always the case\non the first day on a new lake. It doesn\u2019t help\nthat it\u2019s weedy out there. The left-hand area where the fish were\nshowing this morning is really weedy and I tried to get rods out\nwith minimum disturbance. To be honest, the chance for a bite\nwas gone at that point. It was ten o\u2019clock in the morning,\nthe sun was higher in the sky, they\u2019ve stopped showing. But I put three rods out close in\njust to see if I could nick a bite, which I did a few hours later,\nbut the fish charged off sort of to the right\nand the line went through the weed and as I was trying to steer the fish\nback around the weed bed towards me, the hook popped out. That was a size 2 Kurv,\nfished as a pop-up, Spinner style. So I moved over\nto a size 4 Wide Gape X, which is a much stronger hook. So hopefully when that rod goes again,\nthat will be a fish in the net. So, the good thing is\nI know that spot produces fish. I\u2019ve actually had a cast round now later\nin the day and it didn\u2019t look like a bite was going\nto happen and found a better area just about a rod length further out,\nso I\u2019m just over 16 rod lengths. I also got caught up in a snag\nout there, so I know that\u2019s there now. I had to go out in the boat\nunfortunately, to get the line out. I don\u2019t know what it was,\nit felt like either rocks or a tree or something like that. So I\u2019ve kept away from that\non a spot with a little bit of weed, spodded about ten Spombs over the top,\njust a mixture of boilies and maize. There\u2019s not any small fish in here, so you don\u2019t need to worry about\nhaving little bits of particle on and the fish do love it\nin here as well. So when you\u2019re starting an area off, it\u2019s nice to have\na combination of baits. You never know\nwhat they\u2019re going to like. I\u2019ve throwing-sticked quite a few baits\nover the top of that as well, just spread it out right around\nthe area, just to get them picking. Hopefully finding the bait,\nfinding the bait, honing into the baited area\nand then producing the take. So there\u2019s a little tiny Isotonic pop-up\non that rod on a Spinner Rig with one of those size 4\nWide Gape Xs. And then a long area, I used Darrell\u2019s\ninformation from his last session, put the line around the sticks,\njust on the marker rod just with a lead on the end,\nno float at all so you can feel more on the bottom.\nThat\u2019s really, really important. I\u2019m using the Marker Braid\nand 30lb Arma-Kord as a leader so it absolutely\nflies off the marker rod. And I cast repeatedly\nout at 26 rod lengths, and sure enough, Darrell was right,\nthere\u2019s a lovely gravelly area out there just sort of in-between the two pylons. And I just kept casting, casting,\njust feeling what it was like, dragging the lead back. Sometimes it would tap along,\nsometimes it was smooth. That\u2019s a lovely area. If you find something\nwhere there\u2019s broken ground, where you\u2019ve got bits of gravel and then\nbits of soft silt or smooth silt and the lead just slides along,\nand in another bit it taps, I like that. I like having that sort of variance\nof substrate out there. So I\u2019ve got two rods at 26. Both on helicopter rigs\nto cast the distance and not tangle. Both on Spinner Rigs, but both\nwith wafters rather than with pop-ups, because it\u2019s nice and clean out there. I\u2019ve probably put about 30 Spombs out.\nI\u2019ve only just finished. My swim looks like absolute carnage.\nI haven\u2019t even got my bivvy up yet. We all know what it\u2019s like\non the first day on a new lake, especially when you\u2019ve travelled\na long way to get there. You\u2019re pretty knackered, you\u2019re not\nmaking decisions the best you could. You get frap-ups, things go wrong\nand it happens to all of us. So I wouldn\u2019t say\nthat I\u2019m massively confident. I know the rigs and baits\nwill definitely work, but not knowing the lake and not knowing how the fish are going\nto respond to all this commotion, I don\u2019t know\nif there\u2019s going to be action. But I guess tomorrow morning, we\u2019re\ngoing to see some more fish showing and if they get on that bait,\nI\u2019m confident I\u2019ll get bites. Much earlier than I was expecting\na bite, it\u2019s only about 10.30. I think it\u2019s just down here.\nIt is, just under my feet, I think. Get in the net, get in the net... Oh, yes! Got him. Okay, what does he go? It is 32.12. Beautiful. Well, check out the little tiny fins\non this guy. These German carp\nare just so cool, so, so cool. 32.12, this one. And he\u2019s angry still, he\u2019s angry. Up you come. Yeah, man, look at that. That is like a little baby Arfur\nfrom the Car Park Lake back in the day. Absolutely awesome. A lovely way to start. Now what I\u2019ve got to do is basically\nget the rod back out on the money. I was using 20lb Touchdown, but I\u2019m going to go down\nto 15lb Touchdown now just to make it that bit easier. It\u2019s 26 wraps out there and in the dark\nit is harder for all of us to get it accurate,\nso a slightly lighter line. I had no problems with weed\nor anything bringing that fish in. Just came in lovely on the surface,\nall the way in. Didn\u2019t touch any weed at all. So don\u2019t need the heavy line,\nand getting back out accurate and getting another probably\n10 Spombs over the top is the way to get another bite. But for now, I am really chuffed. Middle of the night, I think,\nI\u2019ve got no idea what time it is, but the long rod, where all the activity\nwas yesterday morning, has absolutely fizzed off. Okay, he\u2019s in there\u2026 He\u2019s in there. Chuffed with that, hey? It\u2019s 2.50. The road is still going,\nbut it\u2019s the same rod as before. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because\nthe fish have come in from the right-hand side\ndown from where Darrell\u2019s fishing, or it\u2019s just a better spot out there. Have to go down here. Big old common, long one. Get in that net. Bosh, got him. Well, the first one is always the most\nimportant and it came on the long rod, under the pylons at 36 wraps, where all the bubbling\nand all the jumping was going on yesterday morning\nand, yeah, it\u2019s the first-ever fish that I\u2019ve caught dropping a rig from\na bait boat so I\u2019m pleased about that. I\u2019m not sure how good it\u2019s looking\nfor the rest of the morning. It fizzled off, all the casting\nand getting the rods out yesterday seems to have scared the fish off. I\u2019ve not seen much this morning so\nmaybe a little move. We\u2019ll have to see. Yeah, man. Check that out. What a proper fighting machine and the first carp I\u2019ve caught\non my birthday for a very long time. 34.08lbs, absolutely pristine. This one was taken\non a little 15mm IB Wafter soaked in Isotonic Goo and that was on a size 4\nLong Shank X Spinner Rig style and a helicopter rig\nover loads of Link and loads of maize. Awesome result\nand looks good for more. I don\u2019t know about during the day,\nthe sun\u2019s coming up pretty rapid now and it\u2019s warming up straight away. So we don\u2019t know what daytime action\nis going to be like, but if I get a couple of these every\nnight, I should be more than happy. Right-hand rod again. The fish must be\ncoming from where Darrell is, probably somewhere in-between us,\nI would guess. Oh no, I\u2019m through my other line. Underneath\u2026 that other rod. I\u2019ve just got to keep the rod low now. There\u2019s weed out there. I thought that had come off then. Feel it rolling on the line,\nit\u2019s horrible. A leathery one. Come on, get in that net,\nget in that net, birthday carp! Bosh! Got him! Yes! That is awesome. What a day. 29lb on the button, this one.\nAnother proper old scaly warrior. A character fish, this one. He\u2019s got\na little tiny black spot on him. Looks quite old,\nso I\u2019m sure he\u2019s known to the locals. But I made sure I got four\nor five Spombs back out in the swim before the recast, wrapped it up,\nfresh hook on, fresh hookbait on, and I think I got it out there\nsecond cast. But it doesn\u2019t matter.\nIf you put the Spombs out first, you\u2019re going to scare the fish away\nwith bait rather than with a rig and I think that always means\nthey come back sooner. So another result and who knows,\nyou might get more later on today. So yesterday when we started looking, we saw the fish at the far end\nof the lake, loads of activity, loads of jumping, loads of bubbling and just that angling pressure\nthat we put on the fish, this morning\nit just looked desolate up there. I\u2019d caught one in the night, and maybe I could have caught one\nagain this coming night, but to be honest,\nit just didn\u2019t look right and this corner I know,\nwith the wind coming and with these trees here, it\u2019s just\nlike a little bit of a carp nest. It looks really, really carpy. We\u2019ve seen the odd one cruising around,\na little bit of bubbling and I think there\u2019s a really good chance\nof a few takes over here over the next few days. Well, I\u2019ve had a fair few casts\nabout out there and there\u2019s really not a lot of choice. The bottom is covered in weed,\na lot of debris on there, but so, sort of\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\nit\u2019s about 35 yards out, about six, seven foot off of the trees\nthere\u2019s a silty bit. It\u2019s not really hard, but it\u2019s clean,\nthe light lead slides through and it\u2019s far enough off the trees\nto give me a good chance. So it\u2019s going to be proper snag fishing. I\u2019m going to have to fish locked up, rods\non a little bit of an angle, sort of taking the take and be on\nthe rod straight away to the right. That left-hand tree line\nwas an absolute carp nest. It was a simple case\nof one pouchful of boilies, get the rig over the top and it wasn\u2019t going to be long\nbefore one of them found it. Move out of the way!\nMove out of the way! Sorry. You were in the way. Well, what an absolute battle that was. It\u2019s not a big fish, but it was really\ntrying to get in those trees. But I\u2019m fishing really, really heavy,\nlocked up. I\u2019ve got a size 4 Wide Gape X on\non a Spinner Rig. Crimped 20lb Hybrid, and that\u2019s breaking\nmuch, much heavier than that. Dropped the lead, 45lb leadcore\nand then obviously, 20lb Carp Line. He was obviously hooked\npretty good because I was pulling his head off\nat the start. Bosh! Well, the little move into the snaggy\ncorner has proved a good one. There\u2019s a few fish about. After getting the rods out,\nthere\u2019s a lot of bubbling going on and a few fish bow-waving around\nso it looked good for a bite, and this one hadn\u2019t been out too long,\nmaybe a couple of hours, and a proper, proper hairy battle. But I was rigged up heavy and that\u2019s\ngot this one into the net. Lovely. Because I now run a lot of fisheries, I know that the time the fish really\nwhack the weight on is these months, July, August, September,\nand the more bait you give them, the more they will eat\nat this time of the year. So, it\u2019s different from the spring where you\u2019re normally\nflinging bits of yellow and not putting a lot of bait out, and really, I think that\u2019s the key,\nis learning when to put bait in, how much to put in, so you don\u2019t put it in on feeding spells\nand ruin that feeding spell. You get everything sorted in advance,\nand then working out on your lake, how much do you put in after each fish,\nand by what method? Are you Spombing it,\nare you throwing sticking it? So it\u2019s very much about food\nat this time of the year. Yeah\u2026 Keeping your bait fresh\nin the height of summer, when it\u2019s 29 degrees, which it is today,\nis of absolute paramount importance. If your bait goes off, you put out\ncarpets of it into your swim, it can actually turn the fish off\nrather than bring them in. So you do need to pay attention to it. It does take a bit of effort\nbut it\u2019s not impossible to do. So first of all, my maize. This stuff here\nis three days old already and to keep that nice and fresh, all I\u2019ve done\nis just kept changing the water. So if the water goes a bit cloudy,\nor a little bit milky on the top, then I\u2019ll pour that water away and I\u2019ll just put fresh lake water\nover the top of it, flush it out and then do it again. If you do that every day\nor every couple of days, it will keep it nice and fresh and the best way to know\nis just to eat a bit of it. I know it might seem minging\nbut that maize is fine. I can still taste\nthe corny taste to it. A little bit of salt in there as well. You know,\nif I can eat it, the fish can eat it. This stuff basically\nhas literally been cooked today and all the particles\nthat you take with you, obviously, you can take dry and then\nif you soak them for two or three days before you boil them, they don\u2019t need\nanything like as much boiling. So this has probably been soaked\nfor a couple of days. All I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve brought it\nto the boil, simmered it for 10 minutes, turned it off, put it into a bucket, like red-hot, put the lid on,\nand then it\u2019s carried on cooking it for the next few hours\nand that\u2019s perfect. And this stuff\u2026 You can tell the difference\nbetween the stuff that\u2019s three days old and this stuff.\nThis has got a really rich corn taste, really salty because I put quite a lot\nof salt in the water. That is lovely. Now if in doubt,\nwith any kind of particle, just throw it away\nand cook another batch. And then my actual mix\nthis particular week is the Link boilie, which is my favourite boilie\nfor the summer. It\u2019s Mainline\u2019s new one\ncome out about a year ago now, and basically\neverywhere that I\u2019ve used it, it\u2019s caught fish\nabsolutely straight away. It\u2019s never been in this lake before\nand the fish have been crapping it out. It\u2019s been in the sling. That\u2019s my number one choice of boilie\nfor the summer and I\u2019ve just mixed it with the maize and put a load of water\nin the bucket as well. So basically,\nthe boilies soak up the maize juice, and it sort of makes them\nswell up a little bit. They go a bit softer,\nand then basically, that means that they can\u2019t take any of\nthe crap out on the lake bed into them. If they go out bone dry, they can\nsuck up the silt and smell very silty. So by doing that,\nif you do it in hemp juice, tiger juice, the maize juice that I\u2019ve got here,\nit just adds something extra to it. And then moving onto the boilies. I\u2019ve got my 15 and 18mm Link in there. This is one way to keep them fresh\nduring your session. Just transfer them into air dry bags,\nand what I do, I pour them out of the freezer bags into\na bucket and then pour them\ninto the open air dry bag and it just stops them going everywhere,\nall over the floor. Obviously, you want to keep them\nup off the floor if you can. If they\u2019re lying at the back\nof your bivvy, rats can get to them and eat through the bags. So I\u2019ve got them hung up in the trees. Again, out of the sun as well,\nand when they first go into the bags, if you fill them right up to the top,\nyou need to keep moving them around for the first couple of days because little bits of moisture\nget stuck in-between them and that\u2019s where the bait\ncan start to go off. And then you can look into the bag and all the stuff in the middle\nhas started to go white. So just keep moving them around\nthe whole time. These have been in there\nthree or four days now. They're going harder and harder\nall the time. Good if you putting them out\nwith a throwing stick, but really I want to be putting them\ninto that water and letting the maize juice\nsoak into them for at least 24 hours before I put them out. And another way\nto keep your boilies fresh. I\u2019ve got a great big cool box\nin the back of my van, it\u2019s one of the Coleman variety and if you put them in there\nand pack it in tight and keep that lid sealed down,\nthey will stay frozen for two or three days and the bait is now even four days in,\nthey\u2019re still cool to the touch. And I\u2019m probably not going to use\nall those baits. They\u2019re going to come home with me,\ngo back in the freezer and they\u2019ll be absolutely fine. And as a last resort, I always bring\nsome shelf life boilies with me. The High Impact range,\nnormally the Banoffees. Me and Darrell have used those\non loads of different sessions all around Europe, on the Dutch canal, the big lake that we fished in Belgium,\nand they work brilliantly. So if you\u2019ve got some of those in\nreserve, if you do run out of boilies, you\u2019re not going to stop getting bites. So this afternoon I\ndecided to move out of the snag swim. The clear spot\nwhere I caught the fish from. It\u2019s not the sort of spot\nyou want to be fishing while you\u2019re asleep\nin your sleeping bag. You have to be on the rods quick and the thought of sitting behind\na rod in there, fishing right up against those trees,\nnot getting onto it quick enough and then ending up in the trees,\nthat\u2019s bad angling. So the island\nto the right of the snag line as such, there\u2019s been a few fish bow-waving\naround behind that today and the next swim down to the right\nof the snag swim fishes out towards that island. I can\u2019t get exactly where they are\nbow-waving around because they\u2019re in a no man\u2019s land and that\u2019s why they\u2019re there,\nhappy and nice and safe. But this swim is the nearest to that\nand after throwing a bare lead around out there a few times,\nI found a really nice gravel patch. It\u2019s short of the island, so it\u2019s safe\nfor night fishing as such. If I get a take in the night,\nit won\u2019t be able to get to the snag because I\u2019ll be on the rod in time\nand it\u2019s fairly open water. So I want two\non that really nice gravel patch, and it isn\u2019t far for those fish swimming\naround behind the island to come and find that bait. I used the marker float,\nclipped up after finding the spot, put the float out onto the spot and then used the bait boat\nto take the bait out there. It\u2019s sort of lazy spodding, really.\nI\u2019ve been rushing around all day. I wanted to put quite an amount\nof bait out there and the bait boat\nseemed like the fastest way to do that. So that\u2019s why I\u2019ve done that and the right-hand rod\nis maybe 40 yards to the right of it, to a corner of an island out there\non the sort of marginal slope of it. It\u2019s a small spot, takes a few casts\nto get it in there but I\u2019ve got a really nice drop on it. All of them are fished on Spinner Rigs\nwith pineapple pop-ups, and I would say I\u2019ve probably got\ntwo kilos of boilies and a kilo of nuts on both spots. So it\u2019s quite a bit of bait, but there\u2019s\nquite a few fish in here and I\u2019m pretty confident\ngoing into the night ahead and for the rest of the session. The wind has been blowing down\nto the original swim that I started in and the fish were there to start with but there was definitely less there\nwhen I woke up this morning. I have since\nseen the odd fish down there but for the remainder of this session,\nthe wind is going to push this way and I\u2019m in this swim, got nice spots. If I get some takes tonight,\nI\u2019ll be really rubbing my hands for the rest of the session. In the early hours\nI was dragged from my pit and I wasn\u2019t surprised to see\nit was the left-hand spot and as it came into the net,\nI could see it was a really good one, a really good common. In the early hours of the morning\nmy right-hand rod was away. It had kited, as they often do at range, and I could feel the line grating\nalmost from the word go. Eventually, the fish stopped moving as I guess I had pulled it back into\nthe weed bed it had kited around. It\u2019s really easy to panic at this point\nand pull too hard. I\u2019ve made that mistake before,\nso now I tell myself to calm down, take my time\nand let the fish change its direction and pull itself out of the weed. It doesn\u2019t always work, but on this\noccasion, the spool started turning, which means the fish has worked\nits way free, and once it\u2019s moving, steady pressure on the rod\nkeeps it inching back towards me. It\u2019s a tense time,\nbut if you stay calm and patient, you can often win the battle. I never said a word because\nI thought I was going to lose it. Another mid-30, 34-pounder\nfrom in the night, and the most interesting thing about\nthis capture is what is in the sling. And with it resting for a few hours, it has passed loads and loads of maize\ninto the sling, like loads. And that is a great indicator\nof what the fish is eating. There\u2019s a bit of boilie\nin there as well. So it\u2019s definitely been eating that, but maize seems to be\nthe dominant food source. So tonight, I\u2019ll definitely be putting\none rod on a stack of maize, keeping the other one on a boilie and\nwe\u2019ll see if we can get two rods going because at the moment, all the action\nis coming to one rod. And on a long session like this where I\u2019m plotted up\nin the middle of the lake, I need to think about\nthe tactics I\u2019m using, when I\u2019m baiting up,\nhow much I\u2019m putting in, what I\u2019ve got actually on the rig, in\norder to make the most of the situation. Darrell\u2019s being Darrell\nand dotted around everywhere, fishing loads of different swims\nand getting bites and with me staying put, there\u2019s nowhere\nfor me to move to, really, so I need to think about\nhow I\u2019m fishing and making the most\nof these shorter feeding spells. Well, here\u2019s last night\u2019s result. 37lbs of German common carp\nand the biggest one so far. Came over the heavily-baited area\nwith the Link boilies and the tiger nuts from the bait boat, really accurate,\nminimal disturbance and then casting\nthose pineapple pop-ups on the Spinner Rigs over the top. Lethal. Right, we\u2019ve had hardly any action,\nwell, no action in the day, really. I just think it\u2019s non-beneficial\nto have the lines in the water. Sometimes you\u2019re fishing and you\u2019re trying to maximise\nthe most of the time you\u2019ve got, I understand that. But I think it\u2019s probably better\nto have the lines out of the swim, put some bait out, let it do its thing,\nsmell in the water without the lines in, and put them out again in the evening\nonce there\u2019s a chance of a bite. It gives me a chance\nto nip to the hotel, have a quick shower, freshen up, and, yeah, I think that\u2019s going to be\nthe winning formula. Lovely. Well, I\u2019m only two nights\ninto a session on a brand-new lake. Obviously the learning curve\nat this point is very, very steep. And with that fish I had\nin the early hours of the morning, the best bit about it\nother than obviously, the fish itself, was seeing the sling, when I got it out\nof the water this morning, it was full of maize, there was boilie\nin there, but not much. So I\u2019m going to swap one rod\ndefinitely onto maize tonight, but what I\u2019ve decided to do now\nis to bait up heavily now. I\u2019ve already wound the rods in. It\u2019s just about 10 o\u2019clock. As you can see, weather-wise,\nthere\u2019s not a cloud in the sky today. Perfect sunbathing weather,\nbut not perfect fishing weather. And you see a lot of people on a week\u2019s\nholiday out in France and stuff. They\u2019ve got to have rods out, you know?\nThey\u2019ve got to fish like 24 hours a day. They\u2019ve paid for their week,\nthey\u2019re going to fish no matter what. And you can end up, what I call,\ndrowning the swim by having your lines out all the time. So now I\u2019m a couple of days in, it\u2019s\nobvious the bites are coming at night and sometimes\nfirst thing in the morning. The wind has now changed\nto an easterly and they say wind from the east\ncatch the least and with it being hot and sunny, an open-water area\nin six or seven feet of water is almost certainly not going to produce\nin the middle of the day. So by bringing the rods in,\nyou\u2019re not missing anything and what you\u2019re actually doing\nis giving those fish an opportunity to find the bait, come across it.\nThere\u2019s no line in the water. That\u2019s 100% the scariest thing\nin fishing is the line. Much more than the rig or anything else,\nor even the sound of the Spomb, lines out all the time,\nthey know they\u2019re being fished for, they start avoiding the area. So bait for a few hours,\nsitting there with no lines in it is only going to help the action\nwhen it is feeding time. I\u2019m casting slightly upwind\nbecause when the spod hits the clip, the bow in the line is going to pull it\nin the windward direction. So I\u2019m aiming slightly right and\nquite a few of these are going more\u2026 Well, they\u2019re landing on what is going\nto be the middle rod tonight that\u2019s going to have the maize on it. So I need to aim even more right to get\nthem to land over the right-hand rod which has been doing all the bites. But now the wind\u2019s changed direction,\nI\u2019ve already seen a couple of fish ahead of me on the far bank and it looks like some fish\nare moving down the lake. So it might be tonight that\nthe middle rod is the one that goes, but, you know, doing this now means\nthere\u2019s no commotion later on. That\u2019s better. And I can get the rods out\nsort of late afternoon, early evening, and hopefully get an earlier bite. By baiting earlier in the day,\nI\u2019m going to leave the rods out all day. If you\u2019re at a holiday venue in France, then sort of after breakfast has been\ndelivered to your swim, you know, if it looks like this and it looks\nrubbish and you\u2019re in deeper water, out in open water, bait up, go and see\nyour pals, have a beer in their swim. If someone\u2019s doing\nlike what Darrell\u2019s doing, where he\u2019s snag-fishing in the day,\nyou know, go and sit with him, or go and do that sort of fishing\nyourself once you\u2019ve done this. And just know it\u2019s sitting out there\nworking for you. So when you come back and\nthe fish are in your part of the lake, they\u2019ve been feeding a little bit during\nthe day because there\u2019s no line, building confidence, hopefully,\nyou\u2019ll get more. Perfect. So a lovely 37lb common last night,\nreally pleased with that. It\u2019s a lovely spot,\nsort of a gravel bar and I\u2019m fishing on the near side of it and they\u2019re obviously feeding\nquite well at night. I could spod it out there\nas accurately as need be. I could get it on the size\nof the clear spots very easily, but the fact is\nI had the bait boat with me, I wanted to get a lot of bait out there\nand I wanted it really tight and I can do that with a bait boat\nin no time at all and it minimalises the amount\nof the disturbance on the water. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\nI\u2019m happy with the spots. I\u2019ve changed hookbait,\nthat\u2019s one thing that I have done. I caught the first fish\non a Banoffee wafter and I\u2019ve had the other one since\non Pineapple pop-ups, but having seen that common\nreally passing the bait, they\u2019re obviously eating it. I\u2019ve gone with a normal,\nlike a match to hatch colour, but I\u2019ve still gone with the pop-up. That\u2019s mainly to keep the hook\nin tip-top condition. I\u2019m using sharpened hooks\nand when they\u2019re on the bottom, they do have a tendency to sort of\ncorrode and lose their edge. So those pop-ups are sat just like\u2026\non a Spinner Rig, they\u2019re only sat maybe an inch or two\noff the bottom, very, very close to the bottom feed. So when they come in on that,\nhopefully they hone in on that smell, and, yeah, I feel really confident. It\u2019s just a case of are they here,\nbecause I haven\u2019t seen them and I\u2019m just hoping\nthis wind means they are. Get in the net\u2026 Yes! Got him! On lakes like this it\u2019s so important\nto resist the temptation to recast at first light\nif two rods are still left on the spot. This is the best time\nfor a bite in summer and even one recast\ncan spook feeding fish off the area and ruin the chances of another take. The less fish in your lake,\nthe better it is to adopt this tactic. On heavier stocked lakes,\nI\u2019d often rebait and recast straight away at any time,\neven at first light, as more bait can prolong feeding. But on this lake\nand many others like it, the fish appear to spook off baiting\nin the dark and bites can dry up. It\u2019s a case of trying both tactics and then switching to the one that works\non your lake at that time of year. Yes, got him. Another absolutely pristine\nGerman mirror. This is the one that came in the dark and I chose not to recast that rod\nin the hope that the other rod would go, and sure enough, it did. So I\u2019ve got that one to show you\nin a minute as well, but two bites in a night,\nI\u2019m well chuffed. I found out Darrell\u2019s\nnot had anything last night and I really thought\nhe was going to catch. I thought he was in the best spot\nand the wind was hacking in there. He reckons he may have put\na little bit too much bait in. But I\u2019m surprised\nI got two bites last night, but it certainly shows that the heavier\nbaiting is definitely working. Yeah, man, proper pretty one. This is one of the stockies\ninto the lake in recent years. Imagine this when it\u2019s 40 or 50lbs. 21 and a half, it went, and most\nimportantly, another bite off that spot. So the middle rod this time. It\u2019s about probably half a rod length to the left\nof where all the action\u2019s been coming. And I didn\u2019t redo the rod\nthat I caught the 25-pounder on, left it out the water and\nthen at first light this one roared off and it\u2019s the first bite I\u2019ve had on\ntwo grains of maize and a bit of plastic and that was based\non that fish yesterday that was crapping out all the maize\ninto the sling. So the plan has definitely worked. I still feel I can get more\nin a night out there. So maybe tonight, I\u2019m going to group\nall three rods together really tight\u2026 Oh, all right, mate, all right. Let\u2019s give you a dunk. There we go. I\u2019m going to put all three rods together\nreally tight and then if they go, don\u2019t recast them and\nsee if I can get three bites in a night and then later in the session I may\neven move right over to the far side just for the day, because\nI\u2019ve seen fish showing over there, but I know if I do it,\nI\u2019ll probably cut that other area off. So, for now, the plan is working. I\u2019ve got him. I\u2019ve got him. I\u2019ve got him. It\u2019s a little fully scaled. Bosh! Well, a bit of a quiet night\nfor me last night. Put a lot of bait out yesterday\nand I think a few fish visited the spot. One of the rods was sort of dragged\ndown the gravel shelf in the night. It\u2019s quite a bit of wind\nand weed on the line and the tension built up on those\nlittle two and a half ounce leads, and either a fish bumped into it,\nor it just gave way and I think that was\nmy chance gone as such. But this morning,\ncome back into the snag swim. I lost one\nreally quick after getting out. I wasn\u2019t positive enough on the rod, but the second one,\nI was straight on it. Really pulled from the off, got him away\nfrom the trees and this is the result. Lovely fish, probably an upper double. Looks really good for some more bites\nout there, and again, for this evening, I\u2019ll move back to the other swim and I\u2019m confident\nof some more action there, too. Right-hand rod again. Surprised it\u2019s happened so late,\nto be honest. It\u2019s kiting well right, which is good,\nkeep it away from the other line. Sun\u2019s pretty high in the sky now. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s sort of 9.30ish,\nsomething like that. It\u2019s not a big \u2018un\nbut it\u2019s an angry one. Tipping over its dorsal there. A lovely scaly one. There we go. Come on, you. Come on\u2026 into that net. Bosh, got him. Come here, mate, there we go. What an absolute stunner that is. Just over 17lbs,\nfought like an absolute demon and I wonder\nif putting in more bait yesterday has brought in a pack\nof the smaller fish. I\u2019ve had a 25, 22 and now a 17,\nbut I\u2019m going to keep going. Going to put a lot more bait in\nat lunchtime today, put all the rods out early\nand see if I can get an earlier bite because doing it yesterday seemed to\nsort of delay when the first bite came. So especially in the summertime\nwhen you\u2019re feeding a lot, you need to think about when it\u2019s\ngoing in, how much you\u2019re putting in, when the bites are coming, and basically, just honing everything\nto suit the conditions when you\u2019re at that lake at that time. I\u2019m going to\nkeep changing things slightly until I find the winning formula. I am using\nuncharacteristically tight lines. You see, if I pull that down, that\u2019s banging up against the rod there\nbecause it\u2019s so tight. And the reason for that is\nthere\u2019s a lot of weed out there and the first fish I hooked into\non the very first day took a load of line, went through\nthe weed beds at an angle and I ended up\npulling out of the fish. So I learned from that, and basically,\ntightened everything up from then on. I\u2019m fishing out\nat a reasonable distance, 104 yards. The water\u2019s only shallow,\nabout seven foot deep, so some of the line is going to be\non the bottom near the rig anyway and I\u2019ve got a very, very few liners. Maybe just the odd bleep\nhere and there, but generally,\nI just get a take out of the blue which means the fish haven\u2019t been\ncoming into contact with the line. So even though it\u2019s tight,\nit\u2019s not prohibitive and it\u2019s not stopping fish\ncoming into the swim. The added advantage of having a tight\nline if the fish kites left or right, when I get it closer in, I\u2019m playing it\nunderneath the other lines and there haven\u2019t been big weed beds left and right\nof where I\u2019ve been fishing, which I didn\u2019t know at the time, so I\u2019ve not really been getting fish\ncaught up in the weed. Occasionally, they\u2019ve moved into weed\nthat I didn\u2019t know about and I\u2019ve managed to pull them free,\nbut having those tight lines just allows me\nto guide the fish underneath when they get really close in. And you want to be thinking\nat the start of a session, where am I going to land my fish? Are they going to come into contact\nwith the other lines? And if I was fishing much slacker,\nwhen the fish came in close, you\u2019ve seen me passing the rod\nunderneath the others at the end of a battle. If the lines were slack there,\nI\u2019d be in real trouble. There\u2019s no point using back leads\nin this situation because the weed is up and down\nlike an egg box out there. So the line\u2019s not going\nto be on the bottom and if the fish ends up going through\na line that is back leaded, you\u2019re really in trouble. So in this sort of situation\nwhere there\u2019s a lot of weed around, I think a tight line is much better. I\u2019m using the Stow bobbins\nwhich are my absolute favourite. I know there\u2019s a fashion for using ones\nlike the Black & Whites now, but I can\u2019t see any advantage the Black &\nWhites have got over a Stow. I love the fact\nthat it\u2019s semi-fixed to the line. Any movement forwards at all,\nbasically, is just straight away, is registered on that bobbin. There\u2019s no line running through it\nbecause it\u2019s semi-fixed. And I love the way they look, I love\nthe way that they ping off the line when the fish\ndoes start to take some line and I can\u2019t see myself changing\nfrom anything else. So the line I\u2019ve got on\nis 15lb Touchdown. That\u2019s sailing out there.\nI\u2019m fishing really tight now. I\u2019ve got all three rods\nfacing out towards those pylons. They\u2019re probably\nonly three or four foot apart and it\u2019s important\nto have a line that casts really well and you can feel the lead down with to get those sort of distances\nwith pinpoint accuracy. It\u2019s all well and good saying, oh, yeah,\nI can cast 100 yards or 120 yards, but if you can\u2019t drop it\non a dustbin lid, then it is definitely\ngoing to work against you. They\u2019re on the Basia reels,\nthe brand-new ones. The matt black versions,\nabsolutely beautiful reels, an absolute Rolls-Royce,\ncan\u2019t recommend these highly enough. Obviously, they are a lot of money, but\nthey are absolutely top of the range. And the most important part of fishing\nat long distance is the rod and these are\n12 foot 3\u00be Infinity DF X45s. Really, really good recovery,\nwhich means they snap back straight after you\u2019ve finished the cast\nreally quickly. The line flies through them\nand absolutely sails out there and these for me\nare sort of multi-range rods. You might be scared\nby the 3\u00be test curve, but you\u2019ve seen how much they bend\nwhen I\u2019m playing the fish and if I was fishing\n20 yards further than this I would really struggle with a 3\u00bc. So the 3\u00be for me, when you are big fish fishing\nwith heavy lines at long distance, that\u2019s what you want to have on. And if I had to go further,\nI would scale up to the 13 foot 3\u00be because it casts that much further. When you\u2019re playing the fish\nwith these sort of stiff rods, you want to let the tip of the rod\ndo the work, especially when the fish come in close. If it\u2019s bending right through\nto the mid-section, you\u2019re putting too much pressure\non the fish and that\u2019s where\nyou can pop hooks out. So you\u2019ll see a lot of the time\nI\u2019m holding the rod above the reel and just absorbing the lunges of the\nfish in the latter stages of the fight and then you won\u2019t pop hooks out. And the whole lot is sitting\non my favourite Singlez System. This is the Stainless version. You can\nsee that is absolutely rock solid there. I\u2019ve got the Solar backrest\nwhich really grip the rods. They\u2019re not getting pulled forwards\nat all, and you can see there, I\u2019m using the new digital Delkims,\njust out this year. I\u2019ve got them set\non medium sensitivity. So you can see\neven if no line is being pulled through because they work on vibration\nI\u2019m getting really good indication and pretty much every bite\nis just pulled up tight and that bobbin\u2019s\ntried to get into the buzzer. The rod\u2019s bucking around in the rest. Off it screams\nand you get a roaring take. So that\u2019s the hardware I\u2019m using\non this particular session. It\u2019s no surprise that Darrell\nis using a virtually identical set up. It\u2019s our first choice for this\nsort of multi-range fishing. I think it\u2019s out to the left. Another small one. We\u2019re good. Well, you might have just seen how that\nfight started, and these snag battles, they\u2019re all won or lost\nin the very first few seconds. If you can get that first few yards\nback on them and turn them and get them away from the snags,\nthen you\u2019re onto a winner. This isn\u2019t a very big fish, to be fair,\nit\u2019s a really small one. The smallest one so far,\nbut even little ones can pull hard and you\u2019ve still got to get back\nfrom the water\u2019s edge rather than try and wind and crank and\nit\u2019s worked perfectly again this time. Absolutely nailed. Bosh. Come on. Well, not the biggest fish in the lake,\nbut they all count. It\u2019s proper hit and hold fishing\nin this swim and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some more fish to\ncome, much bigger than this, hopefully. But I\u2019m really keen\nto get the rod back out. The wind is just trickling in\nin this corner. Lovely, it just looks perfect. So, yeah, fingers crossed,\nthe next one might be a bit bigger. Just getting the rods sorted again\nfor the night ahead and you\u2019ll see me and Darrell\nusing the Distance Sticks technique pretty much in all of our fishing. Once we\u2019ve found the spot and\nespecially once we\u2019ve had a bite off it, we want to get back on there again\nand again and again. Using the Korda Distance Sticks\nwhich have got the grooves in, which means the line\ndoesn\u2019t come off too quickly and you don\u2019t end up\nwith a massive bird\u2019s nest. It\u2019s a great idea.\nWe didn\u2019t think of it. It was Jim at JAG that did it. And you\u2019ll notice\nwhen I\u2019m going around the sticks, I\u2019m going around\nin a figure of eight direction, rather than just round and round, and that again, stops the line\nfrom slipping off the sticks. If that happens, you just get a massive\nloop of line, it\u2019s impossible to undo. You have to cut it all off\nand start again. And when I\u2019m winding back off,\nI\u2019m using a little tiny bit of sponge, just an old dish sponge\nand this one\u2019s really worn down so it\u2019s gone really soft. And as I\u2019m winding the line on,\nit\u2019s going on tight and it\u2019s going on wet\nand it\u2019s going on clean. So obviously it doesn\u2019t show up\nso much in the water because all the grit sticking to it\nmakes it more visible and it casts like an absolute dream. You can come back off the distance\nsticks, through that bit of sponge with it nice and wet\nand whack it immediately without having to pay the line out first\nand get it wet and get it straight before you really whack it. So that\u2019s a major, major edge\nhaving one of those. Nick it off your missus out the kitchen and basically put it in a cup\nlike I\u2019ve got there. Just a bit of lake water in it and that\nwill mean that you never frap up again. So I\u2019ve caught a couple of nice fish\nfrom the snag swim today but it\u2019s time to move,\nto get back into the open water, get onto those gravel spots. I\u2019m going to make a rig change. I have been catching on pop-ups\nbut the water\u2019s coloured. We\u2019re catching at night. So if you take away\na pop-up\u2019s greatest asset, you might as well\nbe fishing on the bottom. And for me, I\u2019ve caught loads of fish on\nBanoffee wafters. In Masterclass 2 in Belgium,\ncaught some absolutely massive fish. It\u2019s a really simple rig, we\u2019re talking\nvery, very basic, but it just works. There\u2019s nothing on it\nand I think the reason it really works is because there\u2019s nothing on it,\nthere\u2019s nothing for them to feel and there\u2019s nothing for them to eject. They take that bait, they move away, they hit the lead with that ultra-sharp\nhook and that\u2019s them done. I\u2019m only going to fish two rods tonight and the reason for that is\nI think I\u2019m compromising. When you\u2019ve got two rods on one spot, you end up not putting it on\nat exactly the right part of that spot. So one rod exactly where I caught\nthat 37lb common, be really happy with that,\none on the right-hand spot as well. I think it\u2019s highly likely there\u2019s still\nquite a lot of bait out there on the bottom, but you never know. I could have been cleared out. For that reason, I am going to put\neight spods per rod out, just enough to get them sniffing around, but not enough to overdo it\nif there is still some down there, and hopefully,\nwe\u2019ll get another one tonight. The three lines are going out\nbeautifully off the tips there. Tram-lining out to the spot and I\u2019ve decided to fish all three rods\non that area tonight. The left-hand spot\ndidn\u2019t produce anything. I hung it out to about midday. Although I saw a fish show there, what\nit means is I can put a rod back there. If one of these goes tonight,\nI can cast that rod onto that spot. I know it\u2019s 16 and a third wraps. I haven\u2019t put any more bait\ninto that area. The ducks have still been diving on it\nfrom time to time. If I am lucky enough to get bites\noff of that right-hand area, rather than the rod\nsitting up against the bivvy, I can put it out in the dark there,\nleave the other two on the spot and hopefully,\nthat will produce more bites. So what I\u2019ve basically done\nwith the baiting, it went up to 29 degrees again today, so it would not have been fun\nSpombing in that. I would have done it if I had to, and I did Spomb earlier on\nin the session for two reasons. One, I didn\u2019t want to go out\nin the boat, the water\u2019s quite shallow, didn\u2019t want to potentially spook\nany fish that are in the area away and the second reason is\npeople that fish these sort of venues all around Europe\noften can\u2019t use the boat and they have to fish from the bank, so I wanted to show\nthat it could be done from the bank. Now that\u2019s been working and I can use\nthe boat, I thought I\u2019d go out there, just one trip,\nput the marker float out first, go around the sticks 26 times,\nput the float out, let it up in the middle of the spot, so I knew how much right and left\nI had to go from the float, go out in the boat, edge up to the spot,\nspread the bait all around it, so I knew\nit would be over all three rods and then the wind would push me away\nand then I\u2019d move back up again and spread it again. And I find it\u2019s better to throw the bait\nfrom a little bit further away, so it\u2019s spreads out a little bit. The tendency when you\u2019re out in the\nboat is to put everything in one spot because you can do it so accurately\nand then your rods are splayed out and there\u2019s only really bait\nover one of them. I did about half, maybe two thirds\nof one of those 11 litre buckets. Again, maize and boilies\nthat had soaked up the maize juice and I did throw some further\nwhich I\u2019ve not done with the Spombing. I threw some further behind the spot\nto try and draw fish off that far bank. But for tonight, I\u2019m pretty confident\nthat at least one of these rods is going to go, if not more, but the one that was on the left has now\nleap-frogged over the top of the rod that I\u2019ve been getting the bites on. So it\u2019s further right\nand I\u2019ve just dropped it back and I\u2019ve gone around\nthe distance sticks, I\u2019ve dropped it back by about six foot,\nso it\u2019s not cutting the other rod off. So if those fish\nare coming from the right-hand side, I\u2019m hoping\nthat any of the rods could go. The left-hand rod\nis fished six foot slightly further out. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s got the two grains\nof maize and a bit of plastic on that I had that lovely scaly 20-pounder\nthis morning on, and the right-hand rod,\nI\u2019ve put a match the hatch wafter on it. So I\u2019ve got a Link wafter\nthat\u2019s got cork dust in it to give it some buoyancy. That\u2019s been soaked in Garlic Goo,\nwhich I\u2019ve had loads of fish on pretty much on every lake\nthat I\u2019ve fished and it\u2019s more matching\nwhat I\u2019ve been feeding the whole week. You think the fish that have been coming\ninto the swim and not getting caught, have been eating that bait,\neating that Link, eating it, eating it, and not getting caught on it and maybe they\u2019ve avoided\nthe high attraction of the Isotonics\nand the corn sticking up off the bottom. Maybe they\u2019ve just been eating\nthe bottom baits and maybe I\u2019ll snare\none of those fish on that rig. If that rod doesn\u2019t go at all tonight\nand the other two do, then tomorrow night,\nI definitely won\u2019t have it on there. But when you\u2019re learning a new lake, it\u2019s good to change things\nup a little bit and it might be that rod goes first. I\u2019ll have put it out on the other spot\nand it goes on the other spot as well, then I know the fish are really\nswitched on to having the Link. So it\u2019s really interesting\nwhen you get into a new lake, working out how to unlock the code, what\u2019s really working\nat that time of the year. Everything I learn is going\nto get written down on the phone because I\u2019ll definitely\nbe coming back here, then I can employ them same tactics\nagain another summer. Well, I do love it\nwhen a plan comes together. It\u2019s not even dark yet and we\u2019ve had our\nfirst bite over that heavier baiting. And it\u2019s the middle rod which is in the same spot\nas the right-hand rod\u2019s been in, still on the Isotonic\nand that has gone first. It\u2019s well clear of the other lines but I have got a big weed bed out here. So try and steer him\u2026 Yeah, if I keep the rod low, hopefully, he\u2019ll just keep moving. He\u2019s going more over there. There he is on the top. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s above the weed bed\nand there is a tree out there. That\u2019s why I\u2019m playing it so hard. There he is on the surface. Just keeping the rod low, trying\nto keep the fish up in the water. If you put the rod high,\nthey tend to dive down deep. Come on, mate, come on. Death circles, as Darrell calls it. Get in that net. Bosh! Got him! Yeah, man. A good start. Hopefully, the shape of things to come and it looks like a 30 as well. Well, did I or did I not say\nit looked really carpy? And it doesn\u2019t get much carpier\nthan this. 32.08lbs on the middle rod\nwhich used to be the right-hand rod. That Isotonic wafter\ndoing the business again. Absolutely nailed\non that size 4 Long Shank X, fished D-Rig style with a D-Rig Kicker. Spinner-style as well on a helicopter\nrig over loads and loads of bait. And that seems to be the key now,\ngetting the bait in earlier, not baiting up again before I cast out,\njust putting the rods straight out and it took a few casts\nto do it as well, and I\u2019ve got to be honest, I am surprised it has happened\nas quickly as this, but what a pleasant surprise. So it\u2019s the left-hand rod again\nand I\u2019m not surprised, really. The fish are coming\nto that gravel patch, been cruising around\nbehind the island there and just working their way onto it. Obviously, a change\nto the Banoffee wafter rig and it certainly\nhasn\u2019t hindered things. It\u2019s so hard to tell where they are. It\u2019s just chugging through the weed\na little bit I can feel there. Picking up another rod\nis sometimes completely unavoidable when fishing three rods\nso close together at range, especially with weed around. Over the years, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best\nto slacken off the rod on the rest, loosen the clutch,\nor even open the bail arm, to allow the fish to come slowly in,\ndragging the offending line above him. It\u2019s very tense,\nit\u2019s caught around the other line. So horrible, you\u2019ve got no real contact\nwith the fish. Hopefully, the second line doesn\u2019t slide\ndown far enough to pop the hook out and if you take your time\nand don\u2019t panic, you can often land more than you lose. What a palaver, but it\u2019s in the net,\nthank God, and the road is awake. A proper character, this one.\nLook at him, or her probably. Big old distended belly,\nproper Italian looking strain. 34lbs taken on the left-hand rod. Two grains of maize\nand a grain of plastic, just to give it a little bit of buoyancy\non a size 4 Long Shank X and I waited all night\nfor another bite. I thought I was going to get\nloads last night. Getting that bite really early\nwas a really good sign. Got the cast back out there,\nsort of after a couple of goes and nothing happened\nall the way through the night. And this one\u2019s come at first light\nwhich is a fantastic time. It\u2019s getting really warm already\nand I reckon my chance of a bite, I\u2019ve probably got another hour or two\nout in open water and then if I want\nto get a bite after that, I\u2019m going to have to move the rods\nover to that far side. But for now, I\u2019m absolutely chuffed\nwith this proper character. The first consideration of any rig\nwhen you\u2019re constructing it is is it going to be anti-tangle? The second one\nis will it suit the substrate it\u2019s going to end up landing on? Then from then on, you can start looking\nat hooking arrangements and how effective is it going to be\nat hooking the fish. But if it goes out there\ntangled in the first place, or it doesn\u2019t match the lake bed,\nthen the rest of it doesn\u2019t matter. So I thought I was going to be fishing\nwith Lead Clips here. I\u2019ve moved over to helicopter rigs,\nwhich I\u2019ve used a lot in recent years, and the main reason for that\nis because they cast brilliantly and they are also very,\nvery good at anti-tangle, especially if you\u2019re going to use\na small hookbait. And because there are\nno nuisance fish in here, we\u2019ve been able to get away\nwith much smaller hookbaits. I\u2019ve brought everything with me. So I\u2019ve got them up to 24mm\nand down to 10mm and I\u2019ve settled on a 15mm wafter and that sometimes on a lead clip\ncan be problematic when you\u2019re casting it a long way. There\u2019s not enough weight\nin the hookbait to keep it away from the tubing\nand sometimes you can get tangles. So that\u2019s why\nI went over to a helicopter rig. I\u2019m using a leadcore leader\nthat I\u2019ve made myself. They\u2019re just about three feet long. The other thing about the helicopter\nis when I\u2019m casting it into weed, I can move the top bead\nup that bit of leadcore and by moving that up\nthe hooklink can slide up on the cast, the lead can go down into the weed, then the hooklink\njust finds its natural position and if it is really hard on the bottom,\nlike I\u2019ve got out on that spot, it will probably come down\nand rest next to the lead again. And I\u2019m using very tight lines, so the fish is hooking itself\nas much against the tight line as it is that 4oz Distance Lead. I\u2019ve cut the swivel off the lead\nand that\u2019s fished on a Heli-Safe so that basically\nthe lead comes off when I get the bite. And the reason for that is there\u2019s loads\nand loads of weed in here. If you\u2019ve got the lead on\nthe whole time, it keeps the fish lower in the water and it can end up going into a weed bed\nand you can end up losing it. So I don\u2019t dump the lead all the time. If there was no weed at all, I\u2019d be putting the little collar in the\nHeli-Safe and I wouldn\u2019t be dumping it. But here, if you\u2019re going to get\nsnagged up in the weed and end up losing everything, I\u2019d rather\nlose the lead than lose the fish and lose the lead and the leadcore\nand everything else. So the hooklink itself\nis made from Boom material. It\u2019s what I use for probably 90%\nof my fishing now and just with the 25, or in this case,\nthe 35lb Boom on, I just know it\u2019s not going to tangle. And I\u2019ve scaled up to 35\nbecause we\u2019re fishing for bigger fish. We don\u2019t know what snags\nand stuff are out there and it\u2019s just that bit stiffer. And with big fish and great big mouths\nand using bigger hooks, you can get away\nwith a stiffer material. So that\u2019s sliding up and down\nthat leadcore leader. I\u2019ve got a size 11 Ring Swivel\ncrimped onto one end of it and then I\u2019ve got one of the Spinner\nSwivels crimped on to the other end. Now you can cut the ring off\nof the Spinner Swivel, or now we actually do them\njust the swivel itself for clipping the hook onto. And fishing with wafters, it\u2019s probably\nbetter not to have that ring there. It hasn\u2019t really got in the way\nof me getting bites in this session, but if I knew I was going to be\ndoing that at the very start, then I probably\nwould have cut the ring off, just so there\u2019s a little bit less weight\naround the eye of the hook. I\u2019m using a size 4 Long Shank X and\neven the guys that are working with us, some of the crew are like,\noh, you\u2019re using a new pattern of hook. It\u2019s gone so out of favour,\nthe Long Shank X, that they thought it was a new hook,\nthey\u2019d never seen it before. And I basically used the Gamakatsu\nLong Shank to design this hook, whatever it was,\nprobably 15 years ago now, and the thing I didn\u2019t like about\nthe Gamakatsu, the barb was really big. So, we\u2019ve made the barb much smaller and the eye wasn\u2019t inturned,\nso we\u2019ve inturned the eye a little bit. But on this particular setup,\nI\u2019ve inturned the eye even more. So, I\u2019m just putting it\ninside the Krimp Tool and then just applying pressure\nto the back of the shank and just bending the eye in more and that just helps it to flip over\neven faster and catch hold. And I\u2019m using one of the new\nD-Rig Kickers on that. On a normal hooklink, you would keep\nthe taper on the bottom of that Kicker, but I\u2019ve just snipped it off to make it\neasier to get over that Spinner Swivel. So what you do\nwhen you\u2019re threading it on, the large end goes on first,\nthen the thin end. I\u2019ve already put a Micro Ring Swivel\nonto it before I do that and I do push that on\nbefore I cut the taper off. It just makes it easier to get the ring\nof that ring swivel onto there. So, once it\u2019s onto the hook, I\u2019ll clip\nthe hook onto the Spinner Swivel and then I\u2019m basically using my T-shirt\nand the Krimp Tool to pull it down\nover the top of the Spinner Swivel to make sure that the hook can\u2019t get off\nduring the battle. And that is probably the hardest bit\nof the whole rig. I\u2019ll wet normally the Spinner Swivel\njust with a bit of saliva, clamp down on the pliers\nreally, really tight and then just use the friction\nof my T-shirt to pull it down onto it. And once you\u2019ve done it once,\nyou can make the hook barbless once you\u2019ve got the fish in,\nslide everything off and slide it back onto another hook. And these D-Rigs will last\n10 fish, 20 fish, if you want. They\u2019re really robust bits of kit\nand I don\u2019t like throwing anything away. If there\u2019s nothing wrong with it,\nuse it again. Obviously, if the hooks have gone blunt,\nthen I\u2019ll be changing them and I\u2019m not sharpening my hooks\nat all here. Straight pointed hooks\nlike this Long Shank X are very, very difficult\nto sharpen effectively. And when we\u2019ve got gravel\nand stuff out there, I don\u2019t really want to sharpen it. I don\u2019t want to take the point down too\nfine, my hook holds have been brilliant. I\u2019ve landed virtually\nevery single fish on this and I\u2019m convinced that that kind\nof setup with a stiff hooklink, a Spinner Swivel and a Long Shank\nstraight pointed hook, it just turns so quickly. I think the first time they suck it in,\nyou just nail them. And the bait is a 15mm,\nit\u2019s an IB wafter, which is a brilliant bait on its own, but I\u2019ve just soaked it\nin the Isotonic Goo and that has been by far\nthe best hookbait. If you\u2019ve forgotten\nabout the Long Shank Xs, put them back into your fishing because\nthey are super, super efficient. Got to love a John Wilson strike,\nhaven\u2019t you, in the morning? Carp number two of a good night, really. The gravel spot, the quite slopey one, the change to the flat leads and\nto the wafters has proven a good one. Two fish.\nThis is obviously the smallest one and another one\nin the retainer to show you. Well, the first carp from last night,\nan absolute pearler, a lovely fish. Probably another stocky. Again, taken on the Banoffee wafter\non the very simple Dark Matter rig and a size 6 Wide Gape X. This is a rig that I\u2019ve used so much\nin the past, but I\u2019ve come away from it. Everyone is using Spinner Rigs\nand they are super, super effective. But if you think the fish are really on\nthe bait and especially in the summer, when you are summer fishing,\nthe fish are really eating. In the spring, single pop-ups catch you\nloads of fish, but in the summer, when they are eating bait,\nit seems silly sometimes not to fish on the bottom. And this rig, loads of people, the first thing they\u2019re going\nto look at it and go, that\u2019s brave, that\u2019s going to tangle. And I\u2019m going to talk you through\nthe components that make sure that it doesn\u2019t tangle. So first of all, Dark Matter tubing. Tubing is more anti-tangle\nthan leadcore. You can use this rig on leadcore and if you\u2019re really sort of meticulous\nwith your casting and smooth and hit the clip\nat just the right sort of force, then it shouldn\u2019t tangle. But Dark Matter tubing is thicker. It fills out the tail rubber\nthat much better and you don\u2019t end up with that sort of, that little edge\nthat the braid can catch on. That goes onto a Hybrid Lead Clip and I\u2019ve got a 3.5oz\nFlat Pear on there and the reason I\u2019ve got\nthe 3.5oz Flat Pear is one night,\nfishing to that gravel slope, the tension of the wind\nand the weed on my line meant that it sort of\ncame trundling back towards me. This 3.5oz Flat Pear\nsince then has stopped that altogether. Really important for a braided hooklink when you\u2019re going to be casting out\nis this Ring Swivel. A lot of people do quick change systems\nthese days and they\u2019re putting bits of rubber\nand all sorts on there. Now I can\u2019t guarantee\nif that won\u2019t cause tangles, but what I can guarantee\nis if you use it like this, with a Ring Swivel tied directly to it and the rig is roughly\nseven to eight inches long. This is Dark Matter in 20lb. And the next most important thing\nis the size of the boilie. If you\u2019re going to use this rig, you can\u2019t just put a 15mm boilie\non there and expect it not to tangle. It won\u2019t tangle sometimes,\nbut it will tangle sometimes. So it\u2019s a bit inconsistent and when\nyou\u2019re sitting behind rods all night, you really, really don\u2019t want that. So if you\u2019re going to use it,\n18-20mm bait or a snowman rig. It\u2019s just important to have that weight and that wind resistance\nduring the cast that keeps it away from the lead\nduring the cast. I always use this rig\nwith a size 6 Wide Gape. A Wide Gape X in this case, because I\u2019m fishing in quite weedy\nsituations for big fish, but the single most important part\nof that is the knotless knot and how many turns you do. I\u2019m using the boilie,\njust brushing the bend. You might have two,\nthree mil clearance on the bend, and then I\u2019ve whipped down past\nthe point, down level with the barb, so that when I tighten it,\nit ends up still level with the point. And it may be a fraction closer\nto the barb than the point. You don\u2019t want it to be the other way. If you haven\u2019t done enough turns, you\u2019ll have what I call\na hair tangle occasionally and in that situation, when the boilie\nwraps around the shank like that, I have lost a lot of fish\nwhen that happens. So make sure you wrap\ndown the shank far enough and the finished rig,\nthe boilie is exiting somewhere between the point and the barb, closer\nto the point, but not closer to the eye. So there you have it. A very, very,\nvery simple rig, but trust me, I\u2019ve caught fish from some of the UK\u2019s\nmost difficult venues on this and all over Europe. It\u2019s just an absolute winner\nwhen you want to fish a wafter or a bottom bait on the clear bottom. We got this one. I think this might be all right. It\u2019s getting bigger. It\u2019s getting bigger. That\u2019s all right, that is.\nThat\u2019s what I wanted. One of the mirrors, the nice old ones. On the old back wind. Yeah, yeah, get in there. Come on! That\u2019s more like it! Well, finally, a better fish out of the\nsnaggy corner, it came this afternoon. Again, simple tactics.\nA little yellow pop-up on a little\u2026 a little pop-up rig that I sort of\nconcocted after losing a few fish. One thing that I sort of changed\nwas I stopped using sharpened hooks. I\u2019m using them straight from the packet because I was thinking\nthat the sharpened hooks were sort of cutting out under heavy\npressure and this is the result. An absolutely perfect\ncrusty old German 35-pounder. If ever there\u2019s a time\nto be using fishmeal baits, it\u2019s in the warmer weather and in the summer and for this session\nI\u2019ve been using exclusively Link. I have used a few tiger nuts\nbut not many, really. I think these fish in here\nreally do like boilies. The water\u2019s really warm and that\u2019s when\nfishmeals come into their own. It is prime time to be feeding that sort\nof bait and it\u2019s really worked well. One tip that I could give you, rather than just catapulting\nstraight out of the bag, which obviously works,\nbut to pre-soak them. I like to put my bait into a bucket,\nadd some lake water or the liquid from the tiger nuts,\nthat\u2019s a really good thing to do. I like them to be\nsort of semi-saturated. So they\u2019ve taken on the water\nand you\u2019ll see the attractors, they come out into the water\nin the bucket and they become saturated in that. And what that means is\nwhen they go in the lake, they don\u2019t suck up\nthe bottom smells as much, and also, they\u2019re much easier to eat for\nthe carp when they come across them. It is absolutely roasting today. They\u2019ve given it 31 degrees\nthis afternoon and it seems like an ideal opportunity\nto talk about sun protection and basically\nwhat you need to be wearing and what you need to be doing\nto make sure you don\u2019t burn. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware, but I got diagnosed with skin cancer\na couple of years ago and anyone will tell you whenever\nthey get diagnosed with the big C the first thing you think\nis how long am I going to live? Is this thing going to take me? And it is proper scary and skin cancer\nbasically has only come about through me over-exposing myself to the\nsun, so basically burning in my youth. If my missus hadn\u2019t seen the mole on the\nback of my arm and we caught it early, it could have been the death of me. It\u2019s the reason\nwhy we\u2019ve brought these clothes out. This long-sleeved top\nyou can see me in now is the second generation\nof these kind of tops and I wanted something\nlike the sea anglers wear when they go out on the boats and obviously there\u2019s no shade there\nat all for the whole day, but in a more carpy sort of colour. So this top is basically, you can see,\nit\u2019s got a zip up, a very high zip up neck on it,\nalmost like a roll neck which I know you don\u2019t want to be\nwearing when it\u2019s red hot, but if I was cast back 20 years and\nsort of have a word with myself, I would wear this non-stop\nwhen I was fishing. Really long sleeves, goes right up\nto the edge of your wrists. This will give you that protection\nthat you need. And couple it with a hat\nand we do boonie hats as well now and the boonie hat and the tops, all the proceeds\nthat come from these products that would normally\ngo into Korda\u2019s coffers, go to a children\u2019s charity\nto help kids and their families. Kids that are diagnosed with cancer,\nhelp them get through it more easily, help them have trips\nwith their families, help their families\nbe able to stay with them in hospital. And I think\nthe first year these were out and it was just the buff that we do\nand the original long-sleeved top, I think it raised \u00a315,000\nfor that charity and I\u2019m sure\nas the range of these things grow, we\u2019ll be donating more and more money\nto that Lennox Children\u2019s charity. So the other thing, obviously,\nis to wear sun tan lotion and I don\u2019t like wearing it\nwhen I\u2019m fishing. It\u2019s hot anyway, you\u2019re normally dirty, you\u2019re rubbing that into your skin.\nit feels oily and sticky, it is not ideal, but you need to do it. If you\u2019re going to be out in the sun\nfor long periods, one bad burn can set you off\non the road to skin cancer. So I normally use the kid\u2019s stuff,\nthe factor 50 that I smother my little girl in\nwhen we go on holiday. Any of those ones from any company are all really good protection\nfrom the sun. And I just take skin wipes with me,\nlike the deep cleansing skin wipes and just wipe it off\nat the end of the day. When we\u2019re fishing\nour normal syndicate lakes, there\u2019s no access to showers\nand that sort of thing. We\u2019re all roughing it\nfor two or three days and it can get pretty\nsort of sticky and uncomfortable, but it\u2019s just so, so important to do. And you\u2019ll see most of the time\non this session I\u2019ve been wearing long trousers. The combats are very, very lightweight. They were made to be worn\nall summer long and whilst\nthey\u2019re not as cool as shorts - I\u2019ve sort of\ndefaulted to the shorts today. I\u2019ve put a bit of factor 50\non the old pins because they\u2019re going to be\nout in the sun, but I\u2019ve kept in long trousers\nas long as I can, because it\u2019s just that much\nbetter protection. And then finally, the sunglasses,\nyou\u2019ll see me in Polaroids all the time. Whether you\u2019re spending \u00a315 on a pair\nor \u00a350 on a pair, I wholeheartedly recommend them. Not just for spotting fish in the water, but for watching your rigs\ngo out in the air when it\u2019s sunny, so, you\u2019re not squinting, for picking out the marker float\nwhen you\u2019re Spombing, making sure you\u2019re accurate. You haven\u2019t got to spend the earth and\nif you think about sun protection, especially if you\u2019re younger, all you lads that are fishing that are\nteenagers and in your early 20s, that is the time\nthat you can get skin cancer and it will stay in your body\nuntil you get to my age, sort of late 40s, into your 50s and it\ncan really give you some problems. So I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t enjoy it. Having a sun tan is absolutely fine,\nbut just do not burn. Dan to Darrell. Come in, Darrell. Hello, mate. Are you all right? Yeah, mate, good. Been a bit of a sort of uneventful day\nover here, but I saw the pictures of that one you\nhad, that was an absolute stunner, mate. Yeah, it\u2019s been quite quiet\naround there, really. They were in there bubbling literally\nfirst cast I made this morning. A massive sheet of bubbles\ncome up straight away and the first chance\nsort of went begging. I think the rod hadn\u2019t gone down, must have been sitting badly\nor something, but that take came this afternoon, but it\u2019s the only bit of action\nI\u2019ve seen. Yeah, I put all three out long\nsort of late morning, early afternoon and as you probably saw, and I don\u2019t think I dropped them\nclose enough to the far side. I was worried about going over\nthat really shallow bit where all the rocks are\nand being too close to the trees with it being\na couple of hundred yards away, I just thought they\u2019d be in the trees.\nBut the fish that we saw, we sent the drone up to get some\ngeneral shots later on, and of course, we had a look as well\nwhile it was up there and the fish\nwere sort of milling around, just odd fish\nmilling around in the weed, sort of quite close to the trees\non the far side. Yeah, that\u2019s very\u2026 It\u2019s just like\nthe likely safe zone, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the furthest point\nfrom all the swims. That\u2019s where they\u2019re going to be,\nisn\u2019t it? Yeah, but where I\u2019ve seen them\nshowing before, they were definitely the other side\nof that really shallow bit, which is only about a foot,\n18 inches deep, with big rocks on it. And I was just worried\nif I got a bite beyond it, the fish would kite left or right\nand cut me off on one of the rocks or do me in the trees, you know? So I was only, I don\u2019t know,\ntwo rod-lengths away from where we saw this fish, just as it was sort of\nsloping back down towards me. Nice spots, and then the right-hand rod\nwas even closer to the trees, as I found a nice bit close to it\nand still nothing happened. But we did notice some further up\nthe lake, back up near where you started but sort of around the corner from it\non the far margin, there appears to be\na carp nest up there. There was quite\na few hanging around it. So this evening\nI\u2019ve gone back up there and I had a little donk around\nwith the Pronged Marker Lead to see if there\u2019s any weed there\nand it\u2019s lovely and clear and like really firm sand. So I\u2019m going to fish it probably\na couple of rod lengths off the trees tomorrow with the hope\nof getting a bite on the last day. But how are you feeling\nfor tonight, mate? Do you reckon\nyou\u2019re going to get any more? I baited up pretty early on.\nI used the bait boat again, got it nice and sort of tight around\nthe float, just cast back over it. One cast each spot\ngone down with mega drops. If they\u2019re not tangled and the fish\nare there, they\u2019re in trouble. Mate, give us a shout if you get\na big \u2018un and I\u2019ll do the same. We\u2019ll have a little chat\nin the morning, yeah? Roger that, mate.\nGood luck for tonight. Cheers, bruv. Over and out. That\u2019s a liner. That\u2019s a liner. It\u2019s the final day and you\u2019ve seen me\nand Danny doing different tactics. Danny\u2019s sort of static\nin a central swim, changing it up, sort of trying to get\nas many bites from one swim. And you\u2019ve seen me being ultra-mobile\nand trying to do what I do - find the fish\nand catch as many as possible. Loads of different tactics employed,\nall sort of based around summer fishing and I\u2019m sure if you add these tactics\nto your own there\u2019s definitely something\nanyone can take from this session, apply in their own angling in their\nsummer fishing and catch more carp. Get in there. Here he is, another scaly little banger\nfrom the German snag swim, taken fishing across to the trees and hopefully, there might be\nanother one to come yet. Well, the carp nest\nhas produced a bite. Just inching it back\naway from any weed. Done the hard bit,\nit\u2019s away from the snags. Just walk myself back down\nto the fish. This is the area\nthat we called the carp nest. Out sort of on the right-hand side\nunderneath the pylons, an inaccessible bit\nfrom pretty much every swim, unless you do what I\u2019ve done\nand boated out a long way. I\u2019ve changed the leads over\nfrom a 4oz Distance to a 5oz Flat Pear\nbecause obviously I\u2019m not casting it, and the rig has stayed the same. I\u2019ve put a size 2 hook on\nwith a curved point, just to help it stay in a bit better and\njust threw a little bit of bait around. I baited up yesterday evening as well,\nbecause we saw fish over there, I just sprinkled a little bit\nof that same mix in and I\u2019ve done the same thing\nagain today, just a handful, and I\u2019ve dropped the rigs probably\n10 yards from where the trees are. No point getting a bite at that range\nunless you\u2019re going to get it in and it\u2019s 250 yards to over there. I\u2019ve got a range finder\nthat the golfers use. Fish is still on,\nI can feel it kicking. And these reels,\nthey only take 270 yards of 15lb. It\u2019s right on the surface, the fish,\na long way out, though. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t surprised that this\nwas the first rod to go, to be honest. Just got to keep it moving,\nsuch a long battle. If it weeds me up, I could go out\nin the boat, obviously, and get it, but I didn\u2019t really want to do that\nbecause of the other lines out there. But he\u2019s obviously got weed around\nhis head and he\u2019s just coming in, just slowly, slowly on the surface. The best thing you can do, really, if you\u2019ve got a little sort of blanket\nover his eyes and he can\u2019t see anything,\nthen you just sort of wind him in, which is what\u2019s happening\nat the moment. Lead\u2019s obviously come off\nbecause it\u2019s right up in the water. Going to go down and put the net in\nat the last moment, so, hopefully, the fish doesn\u2019t know\nthe net\u2019s there until it\u2019s too late. If I can get that bit of weed\naround his face, then it\u2019s going to make the whole thing\na lot easier. He\u2019s quite a long way\nbehind that weed bed. See if I can\u2026 Yes! Get in! That was hairy! Only just in the net\nbecause of all that weed. I love it when a plan comes together. Yeah, man, check that out. A very, very angry 27lb male mirror. Look at them lovely scales\non the flank there, absolutely gorgeous, and the best bit about this, the bite\ncame at 1.30 in the afternoon. Sun\u2019s high in the sky, 30 degrees, and it just shows you,\nif you change the spot to somewhere where the fish want to be\nduring the day, you can continue the action\nday and night. So if you pick a swim\nthat\u2019s got a lovely margin to it and some open water,\nyou\u2019re absolutely laughing. I\u2019ve really enjoyed staying put\nand working the swim and it shows if you go onto a lake\nwhere you go into a draw, a lot of these holiday commercial venues\nin France are like that, and you get a swim and you can\u2019t move, you have to make the absolute best\nof that swim. And I\u2019m really pleased that I\u2019ve done\nthat with the way I\u2019ve baited up and how I\u2019ve fished out in open water. I\u2019ve had bites virtually every single\nnight, or the next morning, right the way through the session. What I would do differently here, when Darrell moved away from that swim\nat the far end, I would have gone around there\nduring the day when I didn\u2019t want to fish in my swim,\nmarkered up, found an area that I could cast down to because there was a lot of fish\non that far margin that weren\u2019t being fished for at all. So by baiting up that other swim, I could have gone down there\nfor a few hours in the day, been on all of my clips,\njust baited every single day again to train the fish to feed there\nduring the day, put two rods out for five or six hours and I might have caught more fish\nthat way. I\u2019m out by the nest again. This tactic of walking back\njust keeps it up closer to the surface because I\u2019m going so high up the bank and just keeps it moving\nat a steady pace, rather than pumping and keep slackening off slightly\nand pumping back in. As usual, the fish is about\ntwo feet behind the weed, maybe three feet behind the weed. There he is. Not a great situation, this,\nbut not a lot else we can do. Just hang on\nand hope it tires itself out. It\u2019s come in a long way already. Got to be able to see the fish. It\u2019s sort of down in the water. I\u2019ve only got it! Oh, mate, how about that? Netted it under the water\nlike a match angler. Get in! Touch, and it\u2019s a good fish as well.\nA nice 30. All right, mate, calm down, calm down. Yeah, there we go. I\u2019m so chuffed that the effort of moving\nthe spots and going out super long, taking advantage of the boat,\nhas paid off. Look at this amazing 31-pounder. Well chuffed with this one, and thank\nGod for Delkims working on vibration. No lines getting taken whatsoever. I\u2019ve got them all locked up because\nI\u2019ve got about 20 yards of line left and there\u2019s loads of snags out there and anything more than one bleep\non the Delkims is a fish on the end and, yeah, it just went off\ntwo or three times, felt the line, it was bow-string tight and that was when I wound down\nas much slack as I possibly could and then just started walking back\nto get him away from them snags. Result, yes. In this summer\u2019s Masterclass\nwe\u2019ve caught some really nice fish but there\u2019s always certain things\nthat you can take away from a session and location,\nit\u2019s always the number one thing. We turned up, we found the fish\nand I did catch one on that first night. And to be honest, I probably\ncould have stayed in that swim and I probably would have caught, but I did notice that the bulk\nof the fish that had been there were no longer there. And having been there before, I knew they\u2019re very likely\nto go to that snaggy corner and like I said in the film, I could\neasily have fished that swim at night and I would have definitely lost more\nfish and that\u2019s not good angling. So I\u2019ve been able to hop\nbetween the two swims, keep bait in both of them. It enabled me to keep\nthose bites coming and if you find yourself\nin a snag swim like I was and you use the tactics that I did, then you\u2019ll be able to land those fish\nfrom those really snaggy areas and I\u2019ll tell you what,\nwhen that buzzer goes, you will know that excitement. What a fight. It doesn\u2019t look that big,\nbut it\u2019s absolutely having it. It\u2019s got to be a better one,\npulling like that. It\u2019s a common it\u2019s on the top, thrashing. Wow! We\u2019ve got him, we\u2019ve got him. What a fight. What a battle! Went off and I got it away\nfrom the trees fairly easily and then it decided, once it was sort of\nsafe and I had eased off a bit, to really go for it. But held on tight, and he\u2019s still on. It\u2019s not really ready, but I reckon\nhe\u2019s going to go in. Bosh! Get in there! Yes! Yes... Oh, yeah, it\u2019s a good fish, that is. It\u2019s a tiny bit under 20 kilos. So it\u2019s 43\u2026 43.12! Check that out. I\u2019m absolutely blown away. 43lbs and probably the very last carp\nof this year\u2019s summer Masterclass. Danny has employed tactics,\nsort of staying stationary, but changing spots, and I\u2019ve been\nreally mobile, moving around. Obviously, I\u2019ve fished the snag swim. A few little tweaks here and there\nto help me land the fish, and again, fishing in the open water\non the gravel spots. So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s loads of tactics\nand loads of tips for everyone and something that will help\nput more fish in your landing net.", "WTQvfvoOF3g": "so this video is all about half-life problems particularly the ones that you'll see in a chemistry course so consider the question that we have iodine-131 has a half-life of eight days if there are 200 grams of this sample how much of I 131 will remain after 32 days now there's two ways you can do this you can use an equation or if you understand the concepts you can get the answer an easy way now I need to know what the meaning of a half-life is half-life represents the time it takes first step since to the K so in this case the half-life is eight days so in eight days half of the sample will have transformed into something else the other half will remain iodine-131 so we have 200 grams of iodine-131 after eight days half of it will remain so after eight days we're going to have 100 grams of iodine-131 leftover that's one half-life now another half-life later or another eight days half is going to decay to some other element and half will remain so we're going to have 50 grams left over after another eight days we're going to have 25 grams so for 24 days have elapsed until this point now we need to get up to 32 days we want to find out how much is left over after 32 days so another 8 days it's going to be half of 25 so we're going to have 12 point five grams left over so that is the amount of iodine-131 that will remain unchanged after 32 days now is there a way that we can get the same answer using an equation because sometimes the numbers won't be as nice as what we just adhere now the first thing you want to do if you're going to use an equation you want to find the rate constant K the rate constant K is equal to the natural log of 2 divided by the half-life natural log of 2 is about 0.6931 now this number is not going to change it's always going to be the same for this equation whenever you're dealing with a radioactive decay problem it's always associated with a first order kinetics reaction so you can always use this equation for the most part now the half-life is 8 days so let's divide these two numbers point 6 9 3 1 divided by 8 is equal to point zero eight six six four now this is a round answer so our final answer will be exactly twelve point five but it should be very close to twelve point five now once we have the rate constant K we could find the final amount using this equation AF represents the final amount a initial or a own is the initial amount and then it's e raised to the negative KT the negative means that we're dealing with a decay problem the amount of iodine that remains unchanged is decreasing over time so that's what we have the negative sign so the initial amount of iodine-131 is 200 the rate constant K is point zero eight six six four and we want to find out how much is going to remain after 32 days so T is 32 now e is the inverse of the natural log function so simply type exactly what you see here but make sure you put this in parenthesis so 200 times e raised to the negative point zero eight six six four times thirty-two and you should get this number I got twelve point five zero one now we know the exact answer is twelve point five but this is close enough so you can use an equation or you can use that technique to ballpark how much will remain after 32 days let's try this one sodium 24 has a half-life of 15 hours if there are 800 grams of sodium 24 initially how long will it take for 750 grams of sodium 24 to the K so feel free to pause the video as you work on this example so if we're starting with 800 grams of sodium 24 how much is left over how much of sodium 24 changes and how much will remain notice that 750 grams of sodium 24 decays that means it changes to something else the other 50 that's left over that's how much didn't change that's how much remains so we need to find out how long it will take for 800 grams to decay leaving a final amount of 50 grams how can we do that how can we find that time it takes for 800 to be reduced to 50 so we know that it's going to take 15 hours which is 1/2 life for half the sample to decay that means half will be left over so we're going to have 400 that's unchanged that's still sodium 20 for the other 400 has changed into something else 15 hours later we're going to have 200 grams left over that's unchanged and after another 15 hours we're going to have 100 grams that's going to remain the same and after another 15 hours it's going to be down to 50 so then count how many half-lives this is one two three four it took four half-lives for the sample to decay from 800 to 50 so now we could just simply add 15 4 times 15 plus 15 plus 15 plus 15 is the same as 15 times 4 and that's 60 so it's going to take 60 hours for 50 grams to remain out of the original 800 gram sample so now let's use an equation to get that same answer so the first thing we're going to do is find the rate constant K which is the natural log of 2 divided by the half-life so if you type in Ln 2 which is 0.6 9 1 3 divided by the half-life of 15 hours Ln 2 is 0.6931 I said 1/3 but 0.6931 if you divided by 15 you should get point 0 for 6 to 1 so that's the rate constant k now our goal is to find the time and you want to use a different form of the equation that I gave you before you want to use this form natural log of the final amount divided by the original amount is equal to negative KT so the final amount is 50 it's 800 minus the 750 the 750 is a change if 750 of sodium 24 changes 50 remains so the final amount that is unchanged is 50 the original mount is 800 that's a o and K is point 0 4 6 to 1 so we got to solve for t ln 50 divided by 800 if you type it in you should get negative two point seven seven two five eight eight seven and then take that number divided by negative point zero four six to one and you should get the time what I have is fifty nine point nine nine nine eight which is approximately 60 so take sixty hours for 750 grams to decay try this problem the half-life of oxygen 15 is two minutes what fraction of a sample of oxygen 15 will remain after five half-lives so how can we do this problem we have the half-life we have the number of half-lives but we don't have the original amount of the sample we don't know if it's three hundred grams if it's 500 and we don't know the final amount nor do we know how much it changes by so how can we find what fraction of a sample will remain after five half-lives so if you're not given the original amount start with 100% whatever the sample is it represents a hole or a hundred percent now after one half-life or two minutes half is going to remain so that's 50% after another half-life of two minutes we're going to have 25 percent left over and then after another half-life it's going to be half of 25 percent which is 12.5% and then after another half-life it's going to be half of that which is 6.25% and then after another half-life it's going to be half of 6.25% half of 6 is 3 half of 25 is 12.5 or 0.125 in the case of point 25 so this is going to be the percentage leftover after five half-lives which equates to 10 minutes so how can we use this number to pick the right answer because the answer is a fraction now one thing that you could do is you can convert the percentage to a decimal to convert a percentage to a decimal divided by 100 or you could simply move the decimal point two units to the left so 3.125% is the same as point zero three one two five as a decimal now you can turn this decimal to a fraction or you can convert each of these fractions into a decimal and see which one matches one over four if you type in 1/4 in your calculator you're going to get point two five so it's not a and if you type in 1/8 you're going to get point one two five so it's not be 1 over 16 that's point zero six two five so it's not see and 1/32 this is point zero three one two five so the correct answer is d now that is the fraction that remains now there's another way that you can get this answer and it's a much faster way if you understand it so we started with 100% you need to realize that 100% is one I remember once we had 100% in one half-life of two minutes we divided it by two which gave us 50 percent in the second half-life we divided it by two again which will give us 25 percent so if you want to find out what remains after five half limes you need to divide it by two five times so a hundred percent represents one so we're going to divide one by two five times since we want what the fraction that remains after five half-lives now what's 2 to the fifth power if you're not sure you can break it up 2 to the fifth is the same as two squared times two cubed because two plus three adds up to five 2 squared 2 times 2 is 4 2 to the third power 2 times 2 times 2 3 times that's 8 4 times 8 is 32 so you get this fraction 1 over 32 that's another way you can get the same answer and it's a much faster way if you understand it it takes 35 days for 512 gram sample of element X to decay to a final amount of 4 grams that's four grams unchanged so 508 grams decayed into another element what is the half-life of element X so what do you think we should do here what's the first thing that we should do to solve this problem for this one we can use the same technique as we've always been using we could start with 512 and see how many half-lives it takes to get to 4 so the first half-life will take us to half of 512 1/2 500 is 2 fifteen and half of 12 is 6 so half of 512 is 256 now if we divide it by 2 again this will give us the second half life half of 200 is 100 half of 56 is 28 so this is 128 now what is the third half-life what is the final amount after the third half-life is going to be half of 100 is 50 half of 28 is 14 50 plus 14 and 64 so after the fourth half-life it's going to be half of 64 half of 60 is 30 half of 4 is 2 so 32 and then half of 32 is 16 half of 16 is 8 and half of 8 is 4 so it takes seven half-lives to go from 512 to 4 so 7 half-lives which I'm going to say 7 t to the 1/2 the half-life is the time it takes for half the substance to decay so this variable represents the half-life so 7 half-lives should equal to a total time of 35 days so if we divide 35 by 7 that tells us that the half-life is 5 days now let's see if we can use the equations to solve for the half-life in order to calculate the half-life we need to find the rate constant K since K is equal to ln 2 times the half-life if you rearrange the equation the half-life is Ln 2 divided by K so let's solve for K first and then we can use that equation so let's use this equation the natural log of the final amount divided by the original amount is equal to negative KT now we know the final amount is for the initial amount is 512 and the time it takes for the sample to go from 512 to 4 is 35 days so K is equal to the natural log of 4 divided by 512 and then take that whole result divided by negative 35 so natural log of 4 over 512 if you type that and you should get negative 4 point 8 5 2 and then divide that by negative 35 so k is equal to 0.138 6 3 so now that we have the value of K we could find the half-life so the half-life is equal to the natural log of 2 divided by K so if you type this in Ln two divided by point one three eight six three you should get this answer four point nine nine nine nine seven nine which you can say it's about five days so that is it for this video thanks for watching and have a great day", "f0a0ZaEeXY8": "good morning everybody okay so in this video I've got something I got to talk about I've got a document what happened to me the other day wild squirrel hunting I picked up these shotgun shells at Walmart about a month ago right for squirrel season because they were like pretty cheap they were cheaper than the regular shot shells number six for squirrels they're cheaper than lead guys so I was like alright I'll try on so I want to show you what happened to them and what happened to my shotgun in this video so here we go guys [Music] alright guys I wanted to show you that this shotgun the other day I went squirrel hunting I loaded up I sat down and then I had to change locations so I had to unload my shotgun and when I was coming out of the woods and I went to unload basically eject the shell and then cycle the ones in here out they went in cycle so you can see there is still one in the tube I hope you can see it and this one will not come out so what I'm gonna have to do is take this shotgun apart take the doggone shells out through the tube and that was a real problem because when I was changing location I didn't have anything to take this thing out with and basically my my hunting day was about over and these are these super X teal shot so you can see them and see these so what I have seen and I hope winchester figures this out and recall some of these but the ends of these shells are not the same size I've had this happen before on some Federals and they wouldn't go through the tube I guess when you mass-produce these things these things happen so I just wanted to document this and say hey guys if you're gonna use these shells and you're a duck hunter especially thought of taking these out in my kayak my day would have been over because I wouldn't have been able to fix this in my kayak so this guy gotta take this tube out of here hopefully it yep there goes the end of the plot or the end of the tube and here comes a shell and boom and for you guys that are gonna yell at me the actions open that's weird that this bad boy would not go through the tube now just so we can have a test and y'all don't say that it's my shotgun I'm going to and yeah I have a plug in it I'm going to put this bad boy back together and then I'm gonna put some sure shot heavy Devils in here and show you that it's not my shotgun there's the other shell - alright put it back together put the barrel back on these things are pretty easy to take apart once you get used to don't lose the pieces oh and don't let the plug shoot at the top so hold it with your hand put it back together screw it screw the end cap on rock and roll all right now I'm gonna take some sure shot heavy double it's here one two three all right so these are just seven and a half short shot heavy Davalos but you'd shoot everything from dove to squirrels with and I'm gonna load them up so you can watch it's gun will cycle all right so here we go pressing it its cycles okay all right guys so that's basically the test all right the gun cycles those two wooden so I guess it's just these I don't have a diameter checker to see if they're different there it's like one of those situations where they're super close when you look at them at the back I mean there might be just a smidgen difference and I'm tough to tell I don't know if they're I mean they don't feel like they have a burr on them or nothing why they wouldn't go through the tube but they sure it wouldn't go through to but that's all I got guys I just want to make this video to say if you're looking at using these this is the issue I've had with them I don't know if it was like just a couple out of the box I don't really want to cycle the whole box and figure it out but just check them before you use them and if you find one that's irregular note it make a video so all of us will know like what's going on with these shells I'll probably shoot them until they're gone because I've already bought them and I can't take them back and you know so you know comment down below if you've had this issue with these shells if not put them a thumbs up and we'll know that maybe it's just this box or whatever but I'll see you guys later don't forget to Like and subscribe follow me on facebook at yak moly and i'll see you guys later oh did it again again oh there goes second pump", "V5ym0o43t4M": "okay I think we're live it is Saturday 11:15 p.m. and forgive me guys I have not used OBS Studios in in quite some time I've been using stream yards but since this is a solo stream I wanted to give you guys better quality so I would like to talk about speaker impedance I've seen several questions come up on the forums about what's the difference between an 8 ohm speaker and a 4 ohm speaker so I wanted to kind of do a very basic video here we could do something that's more in detail at a later date I'm gonna keep this pretty short and concise I hope everybody could see me okay so what I'd like to do is do some screen sharing with you on speaker stuff so I think there's a misconception sometimes when people think an 8 ohm speaker is better than a 4 ohm speaker or a forum speakers better than an 8 ohm speaker it's really it depends on the design it depends on the engineers goal when they made the speaker it depends how it's gonna be used and I wanted to kind of drop some knowledge on you guys about that so I'm hoping right now that you're seeing my screen share because I don't really have a way to monitor this but anyways we have an article called loudspeaker sensitivity and impedance explained I will link it up in this video I do recommend you read it it's important and one thing that really kind of stands out about this article is about the impedance of a speaker and how you can't just go by a single number when you look at a manufacturers website and they say a speaker is 8 ohms or a speaker is 4 ohms without actually seeing an impedance graph it's a pretty useless speaker spec because you don't know how they're measuring the impedance you don't know what frequency that rating is from because the only time a speaker is is a constant load at one particular rating is at DC basically and you don't listen to a speaker at DC you listen to a speaker from 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz and over that range the impedance fluctuates it goes up and down the pin whether it's inductive or capacitive or how the drivers interact with the crossover so it's interesting to note that there are speakers that are 8 ohm rated and forum rated and the sensitivity also changes on that as well so if you look at if you keep things everything constant except for the impedance of the speaker and for argument's sake you have two identical speakers 1 speakers 8 ohms rated the other speakers forums rated with any given voltage if you keep voltage fixed they'll say a 2.8 3 volts if that 8 ohm speaker is rated at 87 dB at 2.8 3 volts then that equivalent speaker in a 4 ohm version would be rated at 90 DB so you gain 3 DB of sensitivity with or 3 DB of loudness what all other things being equal so that's kind of an important thing to note and people ask well why are some speakers 8 ohms and some speakers for arms and sometimes that has a lot to do with the driver specs that they're using the system if you take a speaker that has for example 3 8 inch woofers in the cabinet and each woofer is rated at 12 ohms well if they put all three of those woofers in parallel with each other then the equivalent impedance of those 3 woofers in parallel would be 4 ohms it's basically the reciprocal sum of the resistances of the reciprocated resistances so 1 over 12 plus 1 over 12 plus 1 over 12 you sum that up and you take the inverse of that and you get 4 ohms well that's fine like in a consumer speaker with 3 8 inch drivers but when you're dealing with commercial or you're dealing with large powered systems that have woofers with larger voice coils like a 3/4 inch voice coil and and the speaker is designed to handle a lot more power the wire that goes around the voice coil tends to be lower gauge and as a result these woofer impedance tends to be lower in resistance so you might use in that case 3 6 ohm woofers and when you put 3 6 ohm woofers in parallel you get a 2 ohm equivalent so you can start seeing how a speaker impedance can go really low and we'll talk about what the hell that could affect the amplifier now there are there are tricks around that manufacturers can do they can put speakers they could put woofers in series as opposed to parallel but then again you're reducing sensitivity because if you put two Eitan woofers in see in series that's an equivalent resistance of 16 ohms as opposed to two 8 ohm offers in parallel which is 4 ohms so of course if you go across 2.8 3 volts and you do that it's it's V squared over R so you do 2.83 and you divide that by 4 that gives you 2 watts but a 2.8 3 and you divide by 16 and that gives you half a lot so that's a difference of fourfold in terms of how much power that they an amplifier is dissipating just by how they're wiring the woofer is whether they're doing them in series of parallel so you can see the lower impedance speaker has a sensitivity advantage and that's why you get some of the pro speakers or some of the large scale speakers that have a lot of output capability tend to be lower impedance so I wanted to show you what an impedance graph would look like on a speaker because most manufacturers don't give you this most manufacturers will literally give you just one singular rating so you look at this speaker from infinity this is like a $400 Tower it's an infinity primus p 363 I think this I think this model might be discontinued now but it was actually pretty well rated people liked this speaker it's a good speaker for what it is for a 400 all a tower and they rated this at 8 ohms and if you look this is 8 ohms right here 8 is the line here so this is the impedance and this is the face I don't want to talk too much about phase but in general if you have too much of a sharp phase angle at a very short distance in frequency that could cause amplifier problems but I don't want to get too far into that I want to keep this pretty general let's just focus on the impedance you can see here you have a saddle point because this what this system is tuned and this is about where the tuning frequency is which looks like it's about 45 Hertz so in order to meet an 8 ohm spec if you go by IEC standard which is a standard measurement method for measuring loudspeaker impedance and sensitivity they want you they want to see whatever this the loudspeaker company rates the speaker let's say they rated it 8 ohms they want to see that impedance being no less than 80% that rating from 300 Hertz to 3 kilohertz so in this case an 8 ohm speaker should have no dips lower than about 6.4 ohms you can see in this case that's the infinity is really not it's it's it dips down to about five and a half ohms that it's tuned of frequency then over here and around 100 to 200 Hertz it goes well below 4 ohms here so they they could have optimized this cross over a little bit better but this is the interesting thing at 10 kilohertz this is something that you that's unexpected to see the impedance of the speaker dip down to 4 ohms for an 8 ohm system when everything else is pretty close to 8 ohms up here if you take the kind of magnitude of this what this what's happening here is Harman was being very clever they try to use the cheapest tweeter possible in this case because of budget and what they try to do is they try to increase the system sensitivity by going to a 4 ohm tweeter in an 8 ohm system and the reason why they did that is if they were to use an 8 ohm tweeter and wanted to get the kind of output and sensitivity from an 8 ohm they would have had to use a tweeter that had a larger motor structure and maybe even a bigger waveguide on it and those kind of things cost more money so they went with a 4 ohm tweeter and they stuck it into an 8 ohm speaker I don't agree with this kind of design philosophy I think they probably should have spent a couple more bucks and put a motor structure that was a little bigger and a better tweeter but overall the speaker is a good speaker and to their defense there's not a whole lot of program material you know above 10 kilohertz so you don't dissipate a lot of power so most amplifiers can handle a forum load like this there's only very few exceptions some of the earlier class D amplifiers like the older ice modules they did not like a low impedance above about 5 kilohertz so this speaker on an older pioneer ice amplifier could potentially be a problem when driven at full power they could potentially shut the receiver off and that's an important thing to know - is the receivers today have a lot of short-circuit protection a lot of nanny control over thermal protection you're probably not going to blow out a receiver driving it with a forum load if it's not fully capable of driving that forum load but you might shut it off and you might be at a party you might be cranking it up and all this on the receiver shuts off and this is a potential reason why because here's the deal when you're looking at most AV receivers on the market at 1 watt at 2.8 3 volts an amplifier will operate like an ideal voltage source so if you supply 2.8 3 volts to an 8 ohm speaker you'll get 1 watt if you supply to 23 volts to a 4 ohm speaker you'll get 2 watts you've doubled your power and that happens on amplifiers in ideal circumstances it happens at 1 watt and virtually every amplifier I've ever seen but when you get to the amplifiers limits whether it's the power supply limits or it's the thermal limits of the actual amplifier module itself it starts becoming thermally limited or power limited so if that receiver is rated at 150 watts at 8 ohms most receivers will not give you 300 watts at 4 ohms that might give you 250 watts at forums and then when you start driving a couple of channels you start getting into the area where it starts going into its nanny control because it just can't dissipate that much heat and that's what you got to be careful about with lower impedance speakers so I wanted to show you a couple more examples here we had we recently reviewed the SVS pinnacle prime speaker and I'm going to show you their manufacturers page right here so this is a tower that has three I think these are six and a half inch woofers and five and a quarter inch mid and a tweeter so you got three bass drivers in parallel you got the mid-range that's probably in parallel but it's got a high-pass on it so at low frequencies it doesn't the equivalent impedance of this speaker is not going to have four woofers in parallel because they put a capacitor there too that problem and that is a problem with some tower speakers I've seen I've seen some pretty sloppy designs that have no high-pass on the mid-range driver so at DC it's essentially for drivers in parallel and that P dance of that speaker dips down to like 2 ohms some receivers will have a problem at near DC at a couple of Hertz especially if you're hitting bass and they're not they don't have a high pass on this receiver if you're not bass managing that could cause receivers are shut off as well so at the very low end of the spectrum that could be a problem too that's why when a speaker manufacturer gives you impedance back I'd like to personally see a graph but if they don't give you a graph I'd like to see a nominal rating I'd like to see a DCR rating of the system and I'd like to see a minimum rating usually the minimum rating tends to be the DCR of the system but you rarely see that SPECT in the manufacturers website so SPS here they tell you the nominal impedance is 8 ohms and that's in my opinion a useless rating I'm sorry SPS I'm not bashing you but most companies do this but what is interesting is they actually give you a real sensitivity spec so they rated IEC from 300 Hertz to 3 kilohertz and we went and we measured this speaker and I want to show you the measurements here this is a very interesting phenomenon here so if you look at this impedance graph this is the impedance that's the phase if you look at the impedance graph here this is really not an 8 ohm system you could see it dips below 5 ohms I would really consider this a 6 ohm because if you do point eight of 6 it goes down to about four point eight homes so I would really consider this a 6 ohm maybe even a 4 ohm speaker but I would tell it I would tell you it's a 6 ohm speaker it's really not an 8 ohm speaker but the interesting thing is they rated at 88 DB sensitivity at 2.83 volts we measured 90 DB sensitivity so that almost compensates they were like overly conservative with the sensitivity rating but they were not conservative at all with the impedance rating I'm if I knew SVS well and I know the guys there I would almost think that the engine hearing people wanted to rate the speaker a 6 ohm speaker but the marketing people wanted to call it an 8 ohm speaker so the engineering said ok well let you rate it as an 8 ohm system but we're gonna dere 8 the sensitivity rating and I think that's why they came out with the 88 D because if you work out the math and you switch from 6 ohms from 8 ohms to 6 ohms you get your 90 DB which is what we measured so this is a pretty benign load to drive it's not a hard speaker to drive in most cases if you're driving a tower like this with multiple woofers and the sensitivity is 90 DB or so you'll probably be ok with a normal mid-price receiver but I would caution you if you're running a receiver that has 9 or 11 amplifiers built in I would use a separate power amp in this case for a big Tower like this especially if you're not based managing it so I want to show you a bookshelf speaker from Revell and I believe they rated this as a 6 ohm speaker and you can see here it is about a 6 ohm it's a it's it's a little shy of it so 6 ohm shouldn't dip below I'm sorry it shouldn't dip below 4.8 ohm so this is actually closer to an 8 ohm speaker this is a conservatively rated speaker you can see the saddle points here are above 6 ohms the whole system itself especially at high frequency is very high impedance like 12 ohms so I would really call this an 8 ohm speaker this is a real easy load to drive it's got decent sensitivity at 86 DB for a bookshelf that's pretty good or actually if they measured it at 88 DB even though Revell spected at 86 so that's you know this is pretty much the pinnacle of engineering and a bookshelf speaker is here and it's a high-end speaker and there was no reason to make this a forum speaker I mean it just that's how it worked out with the woofer itself didn't need to be a super low in resistance coil and whatever they chose here I don't know if it's a 2 inch or three inch coil this thing handled plenty of power it had a lot of sensitivity and you know it plays loud and plays clean so that's why I just wanted to show you and then here's one more example here's an rbh tower that's rated at 4 ohms and you could see I have a dotted line here the IEC minimum for 8 for 4 ohms is 80% of 4 so it's 3 point 2 ohms that's where this dotted line is an RB H speaker doesn't dip below basically about 3.8 ohms this is a conservatively rated Borum speaker so the only other thing I wanted to talk to you about let me stop sharing my screen here for a minute and I'm back ok so I know there's a temptation despite the fact I've done tons of articles tons of videos on the receiver impedance which people still ask me I have a six ohm speaker from Brand X should I set the impedance switch on my receiver to 8 ohms or should I set it to 4 ohms and I will tell you every single time it's asked always leave your receiver on the high setting on the a dome setting or the 6 ohms and more setting never set that switch to the low setting that switches there for one purpose only that switch is there so it lowers the output voltage when ul or CSA or whoever's doing the thermal tests on that receiver and they want to stamp a 4 ohm rating on that receiver they D rate the power so they make that amplifier clip soon or at lower voltage so that receiver dissipates less power and it meets their thermal requirements so they could say this receiver is capable of handling 4 ohm speakers you're actually gonna cause more clipping and you get a reduce your dynamics more by using the low setting regardless of your speaker impedance always keep the switch on the high setting so I think that's all I wanted to cover about this I hope you guys found this useful the difference between 8 ohm and 4 ohm speakers it doesn't mean that one speaker is better than the other just because of the impedance it's just really about design compromises and design considerations about really about the impedance of the drivers about the woofers about how many woofers are in parallel versus doing series connections inside the speaker and it's about getting as much sensitivity out of that system as you can so I would again say if you're getting forum speakers and you're running them full range in most cases you don't want to use a receiver to power them when that receiver internal amplifier is doing is basically powering all the other speakers in your system unless you're getting like a 60-pound receiver from 10 years ago that had huge power supplies in it multiple output devices per channel and could really handle driving a low impedance loads I would almost tell you to always get a separate amplifier when you're driving a forum a real forum speaker especially if the sensitivity is below like 90 DB and you like a lot of bass and you like to play it loud go with a separate amplifier amplifier power is cheap really not that big of a problem these days and in fact in most cases you can reassign on unused amplifiers and a receiver to say the back channels or another zone and then preamp out to a 2-channel amplifier from model price or outlaw para sound you know there's so many brands out there excuse me so guys I think that sums it up here I hope I answered your questions on

you're going to learn about automotive paint ratios now if you're wondering why my nose is red up here is because I was just painting something anyway let's get into it let's see now when we have enamel paints okay a lot of guys are like man what do i mix this stuff with so I have some examples right here okay so basic acrylic enamel synthetic enamel alright you're going to get basically a gallon of paint if you're doing a complete paint job here and I'm working with PPG alright the shop line brand of PPG if we take a look on the back here it's going to say eight one two one alright you're going to see a ratio like this here eight one two one that means for every eight parts of this you're going to add one part of reducer and one part of catalyst which is an activator hardener same stuff you hear people talking about a hardener or an activator it's the same exact thing alright so don't get confused so all that means is for every eight cups of paint right you're going to put one cup of reducer and one cup of activator it's pretty simple then you mix that up let that sit for about fifteen minutes or so the paint's you know the chemicals inside react with each other then you're ready for painting alright so that's basic enamel paints basic enamel that's just put eight one two one okay so you got paint right reducer and activator okay which is hardener okay same stuff alright so say we're doing eight cups of that one cup and one cup that's your mixture pretty simple alright so let's talk about some base coat alright we have a little bit of base coat here we're looking at the PPG Deltron alright it doesn't matter if you're working with chroma bass if you're working with DuPont or the shop line version delshaun is just a more expensive version of sorry I got my neighbor's over here cutting some grass down Deltron is the more expensive Brent so all around okay all around base coat is 50-50 mixture okay 50/50 which is 1 1 2 1 so if you have one cup of your base coat right here you're going to mix 1 1 cup of reducer alright which is basically this stuff right here okay reducers this stuff will mix with your base coat and your clear coats reducer is reducer okay so we also want to talk about the temperatures of reducers but we actually have another video on that so if you want to learn more about the temperatures of reducers and partners check out my other videos but that's basically at 5050 so if you have one full quart of base you're going to mix another quart of reducer with this will give you half a gallon a sprayable material okay so usually a complete paint job you only need about three quarts which would give you a gallon and a half of base coat doesn't be enough to go around your car 2-3 times you'll probably have extra if you're not doing a large truck or something like that okay now let's talk about clear coat depending on the type of clear you're using sometimes you'll have different mixtures this one right here the high solids multi-panel clear by chop wine PPG we are looking at a two to one alright so for every one gallon of clear coat right we're going to put two quarts of hardener that's how much you put hardener in this stuff right that's how much so two to one basically a two to one or four to one depending on the clear you get alright so some some clear coats are you mix four parts so you'll have four cups of clear coat and you'll put one cup of activator in it so that's basically it pretty simple look on you can and it'll tell you all about it alright a lot of people like to think too much and get all confused about it when you start getting to Candy's stuff like that it's a little different but basically the same overall picture so if you want to learn more about auto body and paint or

I'd love to hear back from you have a great day bye bye", "DBmANGnDKnM": "I'm Rob Johnstone for woodworkers journal but I'm here talking with Derrick Sher Singh from mas epoxies Rockler is bringing in a deep pore epoxy from mas and I think it's really cool lots of people are really engaged in this new technique so Derek's going to teach me how to do it so can we put work deep up to you pour in this little block here yeah we sure can what's the first thing we need to do first thing we would need to do is make sure everything is level basically ship it on both sides and then you can start mixing the box okay let's see how we're doing our level doesn't need to be more than that all right and now we got it level so this idea of a deep pore how do you know how deep you can actually pour a layer we pop see I've heard you know quarter inch one inch two inches I don't know how we make that determination yep so the deep pore system is mass and temperature sensitive the rule of thumb I would explain to people is the warmer the temperatures the thinner you should pour and the cooler that picture is like around sixty degrees that thicker even more so there are ways to manipulate the system I've seen guys do two inch mores and at six degrees at night and then they shot that heat out from their shop and they're able to stall that reaction so rule of thumb and the warmer temperatures if you're working at bump 75 degrees you don't want to go over a half inch depending on how big of a boiler film so with this is a walnut right here we'll be able to do this all in one shot since it's only about two inches deep and all probably about nine inches wide so we should have any problem with this but if you scale this up to if this is about two and a half feet wide and 2 inches thick you would want to do an inch at a time it's right around 70 degrees just a couple of questions so is this stuff gonna if I touch it with my skin is it gonna burn me or anything like that so once the - once the resin the harder of a mixed that's we always recommend wearing gloves just because all epoxies are corrosive and it can be hazardous but we always want to make sure we're being safe so we always wear gloves once the epoxy start to react with this system it's going to be a very long time but if you were to get their hands you can just wash it off with denatured alcohol warm soap water and you'll be fine so Derek has already given me some advice I'm bigger for them I'm going to be doing later and he had yet told me that I should use this what's it called the penetrating epoxy sealer yes it's a two to one mix ratio the viscosity is very low it's has the consistency of water so this is actually a design for restoring and restructuring dry or rotted wood so what it does is when it goes into the wood it's so thin that it's actually cleaning into the wood grain and once that sets up and cures it's basically creating an eggshell barrier to where once you pour the deep floor epoxy any air or moisture left in the wood it's not going to kick out any bubbles or full or anything like that so and you mentioned even though we're not going to do it that this would have been a good place to use the deep of the penetrating and why is that yeah just it's kind of just like a safety concern as far as like your piece I know what is not cheap and if you were to skip a step prior you could potentially get bubbles and foam it is fixable you're just gonna have to sand it down a little bit and do or the penetrating epoxies basically the first step that's to eliminating risks of air moisture foam coming out while the epoxy alright well now we're gonna get busy mixing some epoxy so somehow we have to figure out how much resin it requires to fill this little weird Bowl that I carved out how would upper end you have to have the right ratio of this stuff to this stuff and how do you go about figuring that stuff out there correct so the system is three to one mixed ratio by volume or weight so by my volume is three to one by weight is a hundred grams part a resin to 28 grams part PR so it's slightly three to one but my weight is just a little bit different because the weight of the rezident is heavier than hard I must I must have a lot of resin and so another way to calculate how much you're going to need to fill up the void is we actually have a resin calculate our website oh cool that mas box is calm you can just type in las epoxy resin calculator and you basically type in the dimensions of the project you're working with and it calculates the exact amount Gallants I believe all right and so now we're going to be doing it by volume one when when we mix it up here right correct 34 or 32 ounces of resin and then we do 11 ounces apart so they need to be worried about getting bubbles in it or anything at this point in time so luckily with the deep pore system itself releases air on its own with an extended working time most more simple systems such as like one-to-one systems are too long even if you mix it too fast like let's say like a power drill if you know you're gonna whip a ton of air into that and it's going to take a while for those bubbles to release to the surface whereas if the deep pore system it is so low in viscosity that when you're mixing it up it has the consistency of water basically somebody poured it's very clear and you will notice all the bubbles start to rise up to the surface and then pop on their own it wouldn't hurt to hit it with a heat gun or a torch because that can just kind of eliminate him even more but for the most part we decided to self release it's nice nice that's a big problem for a lot of folks so we're going to be adding some mix all to color this I know that that's compatible with your system what about dyes are compatible yes so we usually recommend like a mica powder or alcohol ink mix all is a great example it's very it's very dense so a little bit goes a long ways just like other mica powders the difference between let's say mix all and a mica powder the ink will be more translucent and won't settle in anyway whereas a mica powder if you were to let it sit and not stir it occasionally everything will settle to the bottom and he won't get that pattern so there is a timing aspect that comes into it if you want to create a certain pattern so we're gonna mix in here we don't need to work it's already pre-measured so we don't need to worry about there's the harder and again the hardener is very very thin so it has the consistency of water basically so now we start to stir can i stir it with a popsicle stick make sure again if you want to eliminate some time and girls take a power drill guys mixing attachment well all I use that power mixer but I'm gonna put some this stuff in there it's a brown mix all just a drop yeah I'd probably do about one or two see how that looks now mister power mixer and then again just to be safe and not be able to get epoxy all over the place what I usually just put it in very slowly and then slowly start make sure you really work it around the edges I'm mixing it thoroughly is an important detail correct a lot of user air is when the epoxy isn't correctly mixed so some people like in South Cox mixing use part of this to make them make sure everything reacts [Music] and you overmix oh no you can't over mix but with other systems like one-to-one if you were to pour this much epoxy in this large for quantity and you were to mix you long eventually the chemicals are going directive is going to start to take off oh yeah that is not good when it was ready to pour with your epoxy start to gel so with this system I usually mix for about well with the power drill protocol one or two minutes but we're going to get by hand Wow Wow well that's important for me to know because I've got a few gallons to pour that and that piece behind me so this is this is giving me giving us a consistent color what if I wanted to put streaks of color into some peacocks how would I go about doing that well you can mix and match colors you can also mix eventually a pigment and not picks all in any Mike Potter and the mica powders there you don't really get a very flat color with those everything's gonna have some metallic shine to it but some people will put it in a little bit of mica powder either they're games to kind of give it some more shine or yes yep but yeah you can mix colors to kind of create your own so we've used a few containers here my people woodworkers are pretty thrifty and so they're lucky and they say well we can't throw all with that thing away can you reuse these articles or do you really need to keep the chemicals from from getting in touch with each other and what use does this denatured up yeah so another great thing about mixing by with a drill is that once this epoxy will harden on there you can basically soaking with some denatured alcohol and just kind of stir it around in the cup like so and then it will basically just pop right off and you'll be able to reuse it same thing goes for the mixing buckets one whatever is left in this that cures you can basically just squeeze the bucket and it will pop right out and you can just go ahead and reuse it we do recommend this wiping out denatured alcohol just to be safe and make sure everything's so there's no chemicals left behind all right but these littler pieces they should probably be thrown away correct yes since we did the too poor method one just has resin that one just has hardener we could create a mild denatured alcohol and reuse them my past experience I just usually toss them kind of just depends on what availability okay cool so now we get to pour yeah I'm gonna let you do that okay good real quick I'm just going to take this mixing stick and finger on this denatured alcohol to kind of clean it up a little bit that way we can reuse it nice all right done yeah we're good apart box is all mixed up and usually when you're poor in the deep forces it's very watery you want to go as slow as possible you don't want to splash it in there and have so that really does flow very very smoothly almost like water I would go a little bit more but it's gonna come it's gonna flow right over here isn't it helps somebody get too aggressive with it yeah so with deep or the thinner the layer the longer takes it here since it's fast and temperature sensitive you use oh it's going to hear from the center oh oh wow whenever I want to check after let's say 12 hours I would kind of take a popsicle stick and poke it right in the center or with my finger of course you can kind of tap the center and the edges you'll notice it'll be very like gummy yes could be so this is gonna you don't recommend so if I build up an outer rim and then or another one I should wait at least 24 hours correct yeah and then I can test it to see if it's tacky if it's really hard say it got warm in here it got really hard that I need to put a little bit of tooth on it yes and then store it yeah okay and then between layers whenever you sand you always want to wipe down with a denatured alcohol just to make sure your surface is very clean yeah you can already start to see the bubbles self-releasing on this session this year so so what what does this do for us so the torch that will eliminate any surface bubbles and we can go ahead and let me give it a try wave it over and glass I don't want to go four to six inches off the surface is that good enough I see about chased them until they're gone over the next couple hours you're going to still see these bubbles come up and just pop the circus out of themselves so which is great so you don't have to tend to it unlike other one-to-one systems where you most likely need to torch every 10 minutes so that's awesome so 24 hours from now we can pour another one and and that's it well Derek thank you so much for running us through the basics here this is going to be an exciting new opportunity for Rockler customers and I can't wait to see what they get done with it yeah thank you you", "69jOeF_7BQM": "I'm Stevie Daniel and I'm going to talk to you about mixing

"S-OYxEsZ_d0": "[Music] hey everyone it is Debbie do us here from home pressure cooking and today I am going to show you how to bake a cake in the new ninja foodie alright this is actually the first time I am using the ninja foodie to bake a cake I have done them in the pressure cooker and air fryer a thousand times but today I'm going to test it out in the ninja foodie so are you ready to get started and let's check out the experiment alright so today I'm going to use a red velvet cake mix I'm gonna doctor it up with just a little chocolate chips about a 1/2 a cup and I'm going to use my hot pan so first we'll mix the cake up accordingly you're going to go according exactly to the Box direction let's call for 1 cup of water 3 eggs and 1/3 cup of vegetable oil so we have 1 cup of water I like to hand mix my cakes but it is your personal preference but I find it when they're done in the pressure cooker that if you mix they may get a little too too high and fluffy depending on which pan you use half a cup of chocolate chips is my husband's favorite combination so he'll be happy it's home from work and we're just gonna handle sure all the dry ingredients are mixed well and now we will prepare the pan I'll use a little nonstick butter spray side in the middle and I think I'm gonna try it on the actual big option on the ninja foodie you have pressure cooking steam slow cook sear saute dehydrate royal bake and roast and the panel is very user friendly basically if you're using the air fryer option with your baking you're gonna adjust your temperature and if you're using the pressure cooker option you're just going to adjust your time it automatically says that it's set on high but you can kick it down to low if your pressure cooking so let's get started here considering we're doing bait we do not need to add water because I'm using the air fryer option make sure you get your tape mix evenly every last scoop it's gonna be nice hi this 7 inch pan or its perfectly for one cake mix I like to give it a little shake get it even okay then I'm gonna set it in the pot we're gonna close the air fryer lid which is a permanent fixture on the ninja foodie and we are going to hit power on we're gonna do the bake roast option I'm gonna kick it down to 350 and we will do it for 30 minutes midway through I can check it and see how it's doing and we'll see it in 30 minutes okay so now for the results it only took 25 minutes so I did check on it and I was happy I did it turned out beautiful we're gonna let it cool and then I will release the spring form and we will flip the cake okay so now that the cake has cooled for about 10 minutes we will use the release Wow that's no messing around now let's flip it we did get a little bit of overflow in the little bump portion but no big deal because that all went into the pot it's so cooling but you can see what a beautiful beautiful cake that is ooh with a little whipped cream we're gonna enjoy it thanks for joining home

mystical base God or anything like that we're actually talking about impedance or more specifically cabinet and amplifier impedance in the most simplest terms impedances electrical resistance or the ability to impede the natural flow of electricity it's that simple now impedance is typically measured in ohms which is designated by this side now how many times have you heard me say this amp is rated at such-and-such watts at 4 ohms well this cabinet is an 800 watt Eitan cabinet when a head is said to be let's say a thousand watts at 4 ohms that means that when that amp is connected to a 4 ohm load or 4 ohm impedance it'll produce a thousand watts in the case of most solid state power sections like this PF 350 here the higher the impedance the less power that an apple put out that's usually why you'll see two different power ratings on the back of the solid state in so this particular amp will put out 350 watts at 4 ohms but only 250 watts at 8 ohms so what happens if we go the opposite direction and go below for ohms let's say 2 ohms well the amp might work for a little while but it will eventually thermal itself out and protect itself by momentarily turning off the power section that usually indicates that there's something wrong meaning it's trying to run below its nominal impedance or the impedance it was designed to operate at typically most Bayesian are rated at 8 and 4 ohms some tube amps like this heritage CL are rated at 2 or 4 ohms the most important thing to remember though is this stay within the manufacturers recommended impedance ratings if it says for 8 ohms run it at either for a doll in the case of any of our tube amps like this heritage CL or any classic CL or VR 2 Pro stay within the 2 or 4 ohm ratings and never ever ever run them without a speaker load of some sort connected to them ok now let's talk about cabinets again most base cabinets are designed in either 4 or 8 on configurations I've yet to see a 2 ohm cabinet because most heads won't go down to 2 ohms at 16 ohms is usually where you see some guitar amp cabinets but hardly ever for bass power readings don't change on a cabinet though because it's the cabinet's designed impedance that's causing the resistance the amp in the first place when a cabin is designed for specific impedance that impedance will never change so for all practical purposes let's say we're dealing with either a 4 or an 8 ohm cabinet now in the case of this heritage a 10 e cabinet this guy is a 4 ohm cabinet so we know that any amp we plug into this cabinet you put out power that that amp is rated for at 4 ohms now let's take a look at this PF 115 Ag cabinet this guy is an 8 ohm cab so we know that any amp we plug into this cabinet will put out the power that that amp is rated for at 8 ohms now what happens when we combine cavitus remember back in high school algebra when we all ask when the heck will I ever need this in life well now is the time so when we combine cabinets either by daisy chaining them meaning one cabinet to another or running one cabinet from each speaker out on the back of the head we change the overall impedance presented to the amplifier now for all you electrical gurus out there I should mention that all ampeg speaker connections on both our heads and our cabinets are wired in parallel to eight old cabs now become one 4 ohm load 2 4 ohm cabs now become 1 2 ohm load what happens if we combine an 8 ohm cab with a 4 ohm cab we actually come up with a load of two point six seven ohms so a simple equation is to just take the common opinions of the two cabs and divide it by the number of cabinets so in this case two for old cabinets divided by the number of cabs two of them gives you 2 ohms but that only works so far the actual equation is impedance times impedance over impedance plus impedance and I know there's that whole high school algebra thing again so let's take a 4 ohm cab and an 8 ohm cab and multiply them together 4 times 8 gives us 32 right now take those same cabs and add them together 4 plus 8 gives us 12 so 32 divided by 12 gives us two point six six six seven ohms but for all intents purposes we'll just call it two point six seven ohms again most amps won't or don't work down to 2 ohms and those that do definitely don't want to see a weird combination like two point six seven ohms so combining two different impedances really isn't recommended so next time you get the idea of daisy-chaining all of your base cabinets together along with all of your buddies base cabinets to make one huge wall of doom be careful and make sure you're running within your amps recommended impedances and power ratings or you'll be paying homage to the gods of bass amp repair I know it's a bad anyways I hope this helps you

He feels a lot of responsibility You should know He's always the same and confident I made this thanking him\nfor leading our group Thank you How heavy it looks I like it They all match their owners - Does it match me?\n- Yes, it does (Proud) I put a lot of thought into this The reason why I added\nso many squids here is... It signifies 'Let's stay\ntogether for a long time' I made it with that meaning to it I haven't been able to meet my family\na lot when I was a trainee He really comforted me\nbut I know how hard it was for him too After we made our debut as The BOYZ He's always energetic\nand hard working That was always great to see I made this necklace with the hope\nthat we go as a group for a long time Who will it be? Jacob or Kevin Eric - It's\n- Kevin? Jacob? Kevin Kevin win - I can eat the squid\n- Kevin, you have to laugh I can roast it\nwhen I'm hungry (Oh the smell) I hope we continue like this\nfor a long time I really put a lot of effort into it It smells a lot (Who is Kevin's manito?)\nWhen I first became a trainee He was one of those friends who\nreally helped me get used to everything He's one of those members\nthat work really hard (I think it's you, Q) Me? That friend is not Haknyeon But, Q Haknyeon's always getting up He even put his name on it Where does it say Q? This is Q - Oh it is\n- Golden fingers of course Thank you It looks like earphones\non both sides Put the earphones on I can hear the sea (A dance seducing\nmusic feature) I said that I wanted Kevin's I thought I didn't have a manito Did no one treat you well? That's not it but I'm so thankful that someone\ntook the time to make something for me Please show us your necklace, Q I really made it well There's a handle here There's a crown on top of the handle It means 'Be the best' Does it mean that\nyour manito's a prince? Yes it means he's good looking The thing that I've been thankful\ntowards my manito is When I have a concern And when I'm searching for a solution I talk with this friend a lot I think we support each other a lot It's Juyeon I thought it was New - It's Juyeon\n- Really? I'm moved (Sending the necklace) I cared for Juyeon a lot today Did you notice? I didn't realize then\nbut now that I look back, I realize (When they were aiming for\nthe same object in The Secret Forest) (He simply yielded to Juyeon) I'll give you the clear crystal beads Juyeon, lie down here - How is it?\n- This is rather comfortable (Just like one time manito Q) I just felt that I got closer to Q\nbecause he was so nice to me That's what I was thinking You didn't notice anything?\nYou should have noticed something I didn't (Juyeon's manito is?) I wasn't able to talk\nto him much today I know that he likes\naccessories and stuff I put a lot of effort into it It's Younghoon (An accurate prediction,\nJuyeon hands Younghoon his necklace) Younghoon Why didn't you talk to him today? Younghoon was very quiet today What are you thankful about Younghoon? First of all he's my roommate We talk about our worries\nand troubles a lot these days - And both of you talk in your sleep\n- That's right Now, Younghoon What are you thankful\nabout regarding your manito? He's an official angel It's Jacob Thanks! He's always hard working I thought it was me Oh really?

today I'll be showing you how to measure staff the proper measuring techniques the measuring stools and all the stuff needed basically when making where differs most is the amount of ingredients that you use if the amount of ingredients is not perfect the cake or the thing will not come out perfectly so many people have asked me in the comment box also what one cup is equals how many grams and many more stuff like that one more thing that I have to say is that when you type in Google and see one cup of flour is equals how many grams you'll get different opinions like 120 125 130 150 and all those kind of opinions but today I've shown it in life for you to measure and how much it weighs I've got 150 grams so let's get on to the sweet here I have all the tools that we use for measuring wet and dry ingredients for baking cooking etc first you're 1/2 cup cups are used for measuring wet and dry ingredients your F spoons sports the same way is used for measuring wet and dry ingredients here is a weighing scale it is not a much necessary tool buying baking and cooking but some recipes called for ground measurements so if you want to use it in France then it is a bit necessary so you can measure dry ingredients in this weighing scale we usually don't measure wet ingredients in a weighing scale and grams then here is another cup this is useful in wet ingredients in mills and litters so first let's get started with the cups here I have all the cup measurements this is one cup this is half cup this is 1/3 cup this is 1/4 cup and this is 1/8 cup so in-between 1 cup and 1/2 cup there are two measurements which is 3/4 cup and 2/3 cup I don't have them today so I'm not showing them so one cup is 16 tablespoons that is 48 teaspoons 3/4 cup is 12 tablespoons that is 36 teaspoons 2/3 cup is 11 tablespoons that is 32 teaspoons 1/2 cup is 8 tablespoons that is 20 40 spoons 1/3 Cup is 5 and 1/2 tablespoons which is 16 teaspoons 1/4 cup is 4 tablespoons which is 12 teaspoons 1/8 cup is 2 tablespoons which is 6 teaspoons so in between if you don't have a few cups it's fine for example I don't have 3/4 cup so 1/4 cup plus 1/2 cup gives me 3/4 cup I don't have 2/3 cup also so 1/3 cup plus 1/3 cup gives me 2/3 cup if you don't have 1 cup 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup gives me 1 cup then if you don't have 1/4 cup 1/8 cup plus 1/8 cup gives me 1 foot cup that's it so if you don't have a few measurements you can add up together and make that measurement so it might feel a little bit confusing when I say it like this so I leave everything in the description down below so that you can check it write it down in your notebook and refer it whenever you want so now I'm going to show you how to measure stuff in cups so right here I have some flour and I have 1 cup so now I'm going to show you how to measure ingredients in cups first thing that if the mixture is the cup should be totally dry second thing is that you should always use the spoon to scoop in your flour and whatever stuff into the cup you should not directly scoop into it or else the measurement will come wrong so let's take one day is teaspoon by teaspoon or a spoon by spoon and add it into the cup let's take it up or fill it as much as you can and then the third thing is that you should not press it down with a spoon if you do that there are chances of getting an extra flat which will make your recipe wrong so what you have to do is take a knife and just flatten it down like that this will make sure that you get the perfect amount and that's the ingredient and that's how you measure it in cups now let's go ahead and check how much this will weigh in my wing skin so right here I have my being scale let's start first there's a button right here colors on/off and tear press on that so the weighing scale will on then let's keep in the plate you're gonna use and in the same button you just press so the measurement of the bowl will get decreased then let's add in the flour so you can see you've got 145 grams so it's fine it's actually 150 grams so it will differ sometimes but that's fine five grams is not even half a tablespoon so it's just fine and this is a perfect amount of the flood another thing that most people get confused is that they think ingredients weigh the same in grams but they don't so I suppose I have one cup of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of sugar sugar would weigh 240 grams but the flour will weigh 150 grams that's because sugar is more heavier than the flat the same way powdered sugar brown sugar cake flour all-purpose flour bread flour baking powder baking soda cocoa powder everything differs so in case you get confused and leave everything in the description down below so that you can refer now let's move on to measuring wet ingredients in cups so this is a 1/2 cup and below that it is written 125 ml clearly in the same cup so most of the cups will have the middle measurement with the cup measurement also so you don't specifically have to take another cup and measure it in ml again and again another thing wet ingredients everything is the same in ml it's not like dry ingredients that this measure is different and the other one measure is different everything was your same for example I have half a cup of milk and half a cup of oil both measure 125 ml only they don't differ but but still I leave everything in the description so that you can again refer so here I have spoons this is one tablespoon this is half a tablespoon this is one teaspoon this is half a spoon and this is 1/4 teaspoon one tablespoon is three teaspoons and half a tablespoon is one and a half teaspoons for suppose you want to make 3/4 teaspoon then you can take 1/2 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon which gives you 3/4 teaspoon so it's just same like measuring dry ingredients and wet ingredients in cups so here I have supply this is a tablespoon I'm just gonna take it like that and flatten it so you have 1 tablespoon that's ready that's so simple that's it thank you so much for watching hope you liked it I hope this video is very useful to you thanks once again bye-bye", "4dDHTAtq01I": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel so today I wanted to show you a very simple video just like a tip so you guys have been asking me how many box cake mix boxes do you use for 1/2 sheet cake I use 3 boxes umm I'll insert a picture here so you guys can see which box I use I use a double split cake by Pillsbury and for just one sheet I used three boxes sewing total to do the top layer of the cake I use 6 boxes in total I hope I made sense yeah some people when charging for a cake they will you know ask for more money since it is a thicker layer of cake I I guess I don't charge it anymore this is just how I offer my cakes I like them to be nice and fluffy and thick when I am using a cake mix that's how many boxes I'll use and then I'll just do one change which is instead of water I use all milk this really creates a different taste to it but like better and yeah I definitely don't over mix just until everything is well incorporated I stopped mixing because like most of you will know if you over mix you know your cake will get very tough it wouldn't be fluffy moist as it should be and this cake mix really really comes out super moist I love it I always use it I use it for a choco flan which is the cake and then um swans when you bake it together they come out together yeah I hope I mentioned yes yes basically what I use and then you also you guys also had another point which is how do i grease my pants for this kind of cake since it is a little bigger this is what I mean by one sheet one sheet of these I use three boxes well I just use vegetable shortening to grease my pants I feel like it's cheaper then using Pam since the bottle like the regular sized bottle you will definitely almost pick it up since you do I mean I use two sheets in total since you know it's two layers of the cake I hope I'm making sense but yes this is what I do I use I just use a napkin to grease the pan and that's it and then I'll just pour in my batter and then you do have to be careful when using a rectangle cake sheet just because one side could come a little uneven and you guys have been requesting a lot of like cake videos like baking like decorations of cakes and stuff like that and I'll definitely have more videos of those um just little by little I want to put them up I also want to start translating the videos I already had in Spanish to English just I feel like that would help you and especially in other delicious recipes I wanna you know share with you just sometimes I don't have the time to record them because I definitely all the recipes I show on here I always do them again are just that sometimes I don't have the time to record it just it does take longer when you're recording you know the recipe yeah I hope you guys like this video and if you aren't already subscribed to my channel make sure to hit that subscribe button I'll see you guys next time so bus", "gOJYfXVsBEQ": "so today I'm going to talk you through the different size pasca pen nibs and they come in a variety of sizes from a very very large 17 K which is 15 millimeters to a very fine one M R which is 7 that's re nought point 7 millimeters and you even have a brush tip as well so we're going to talk through all the different sizes and the different lines that they produce to give you a wealth of creative options so we're going to start with the largest pen the 17 K so we'll just put these from this to one side and start with the 17 K and this is the largest pen that pasca produce and as you can see it's got a very robust nib the K stands for the sort of shape of the nib so the K at this K is a chisel tip nib and as you can see it produces a very robust square line so [Music] makes that very satisfying sound so this is very very well liked by street artists because obviously it can cover very very very large areas and also because of its lovely square nib it's got a variety of different marks that you can make with it so that is 17 K and it's 15 millimeters so that's 1.5 centimeters so to continue with the k's and this is the other ii okay and this is the 8 k this is this is an 8 millimeter tip so it's slightly smaller than a centimeter again it's got a lovely variation in line because of its chisel tip I particularly like it for handwriting so if we do a a b c you can see that it works really beautifully with handwriting again lovely color coverage and i'm showing you one of the many metallics that pasca metallic colors that POSCO produce as you can see gives a lovely shiny effect so let's just see that in the light so it's a nice nice little metallic there but also as I say lovely lovely chisel tip again really good for sign writing excellent color coverage so great for street art and large-scale artworks and just generally an all-round good large robust pen for handwriting and drawing so we've got we've covered our K pens the 17 K and the 8 K so now we'll move on to our M pens and the M is the bullet tip pens so I'll start with the largest bullet tip and this is the paska 7 M now this was only released quite recently actually it was only in the last sort of 18 months that this has been released so it's an a new pen and it's very very exciting the Scott you can see it's lovely round tip it's got a 4.5 to 5 millimeter tip so it's still quite large and robust as you can see it gives these perfect little circles when you dot it but it also as well there's this lovely line so fantastic for outlines I would coordinate it sometime with the 17 K and the 8 K so if you were doing large pieces of work you could cover him with that an outline with this but the color coverage is also very good as well so you can see just how easily that that covers in so this is a great pen for all kinds of work but large scale artwork would be great or place where you had a lot of color coverage but you can also get the definition as well so that's excellent that's a 7 M so the next one down from the 7 M is the 5 m and the 5 m has a 1.8 to 2.5 millimeter tip and that basically just tells you the line that it gives you so you can see in comparison to the 7 M which was 4 point 5 to 5 point 5 this is 1 point 8 to 2 point 5 so you can go on an angle we can go on the tip and I'll just show you the dots it produces in comparison so you can see different things that it does and I'll just show you the color coverage as well it's got an excellent color coverage and this is great for all manner of art projects it can be used on medium art projects on covering in it's probably quite a good starter pasca because it's got the definition of the bullet tip but it's equally got the large surface area color coverage as well so it's a good robust pen that's what comparison proposed lines in there so the next one down from the 5m is the 3m and 3m produces a not 0.92 1.3 millimeter line so we'll just demonstrate here at comparison so if I do a little dot in between our redden our peach color you can see that the 3m it's slightly more refined but it's still got that bullet tip this is again oh no that's for later tell you about that in a second it's really good for color coverage and excellent for outline so you can use this on large scale work to add extra precision or indeed you could do it on medium or smaller scale work for color coverage but you can see it's got a very very good line but also excellent color coverage as well now with the 5m and the 3m you can remove the tip and reverse it they've both got reversible tips I'll show you on the 5m as well you can see they're both reversible if I hold it like that that's probably better indication I'm not worried about this same paint getting on my hands by the way because as you know pastas are water-based they're non-toxic so it's not hurting me in any way I don't feel any reaction or anything and so they're both reversible and you can also replace the nibs if you need to you can also get replacement nibs I have to say that I'm quite rough with my pens I sort of press down I do all sorts of things them I don't ever feel the need to replace my nibs but on the 3m and the 5m you can replace the nibs I'll stop playing with this now move on to the next size so that's the 3m so a continuation from the 3m is three ml or in the 3m oh it's a quite special pen because this is the sparkling glitter pens that paska do and they're they're in our range of colors and you've got lovely red green yellow as well so they're fantastic I'd particularly like them on on fabric but they've worked really well on paper as well they give a lovely glittery sparkly sheen they're quite nice on stone as well I've done a couple of stone projects with them so again it's the it gives the same line finish as the 3m so I'll just show you just move these out the right as you can see that they're quite it's quite similar line nor point nine to 1.3 millimeter thing but this is just a slightly harder nib just to contain the the glitter if I just if you just see there if I hold up to the light you can see that shimmer and as we know as well now that this is this is dry I can work over my different colors as well which is quite nice so that's the glittery pen so now we move on to the slightly finer pens in the EM range so we have the 1n which has got a bullet tip but it's slightly more pointed on the end so if I show you with the dots you can see it's got slightly smaller dots this is a naught point seven millimeter tip so if I work on the very tip I can produce a very fine line if I hold it at an angle I can produce a thicker line so it's a good versatile pen if I show you bit so but the tip find an angle thicker so this is really good for a range of different projects I particularly like it for smaller illustration or round card-making things or if I'm doing sort of fiddly glass painting if I can also do this with it if I pull and drag it so I can use it a bit like a paintbrush so it's a very versatile pen so again fine detail with the tip but then if I want to color in I can go at an angle I can get good color coverage as well so it's a good all-rounder this one again particularly did for smaller smaller projects so we have the final M pen and this is the one M are now like the one end it has a nought point seven millimeter tip but it's not angled it's just a very round tip so you will always get that consistent fine line I'll just add some dots here so you can see how fine this pen is it's also really good for writing I'll just write my name so you can see if you wanted to do sort of outlines very fine outlines but also you want to do some writing it's good for that that's the one M R and again very very good for color coverage so if you were wanting if you knew that you worked quite small and you wanted something that was gonna be sort of a good all-rounder and for small projects this might be one to watch as well and I'll just you can just see how lighter colors work on darker colors once the pastas dried as well so finally we have the brush nib of the pasta pens and this brush tip works slightly differently to the other pastas where with the other ones you prime your pen by shaking it and pressing down this is slightly different you shake it but because this brush tip not particularly press that down you just press down the little button at the end and that will give you some beautiful paint flow so I'll just you can just see how beautifully that flows there and you can really see the variation in line so you can go straight on or you can work at the very tip to produce some lovely line there and you can see how beautifully it flows so depending on your pressure turn this around so we can see a bit better I'm producing rather a lovely pattern here so I can go and create beautiful brush effects but with all the precision of a pen that and that's why I really like this 10 for brush script so I'll just write the word love and you can see what I mean so this is some brush scripts quite fashionable at the moment it's great to be able to have the power of this brush but with a precision of pen so there is your as I say you can just show the different very very long as you can create so there is your lovely brush tip so I hope you've enjoyed going through all the pens we'll just what we'll do is we'll just finish off by just recapping so you've got the 17k we'll just put the different nib sizes bite so you can see more clearly the 8k see if I can balance these pens keep it precarious at the balance there the 7 M the 5 m again remember that the foot with the 5 m and the 3m that your nibs are reversible and changeable then we've got the 3 ml the 1em 1em are and the lovely brush so there you have it they are all the different lip sizes all available for you to see and to enjoy", "-wKStXQaik4": "hi I'm Steve Jones so I'm going to tell you how to change liters into milliliters well the first thing to understand is the basic system where we get that 1 liter is in fact 1,000 milliliters and we need to get the correct our abbreviations 1 liter liter is just an L and a milliliter is little M little L this is in fact the easiest process or the easier process because for every liter if we have five point six liters we simply have to multiply it by a thousand so it's going to be five point six times 1,000 milliliters now five point six times a thousand is best done by simply moving the decimal place if I write five point six there and look at this decimal place here I know that if I multiply a number by 10 I simply move the decimal point one place to the right if I want to move it if I want to multiply by a hundred I move it two decimal places to the right and if I want to multiply by a thousand I'll move it three decimal places and so on this goes on forever so I have to put notes here because there are no zeros there and my decimal point now is going to come there and this now becomes of course my comma for my thousands so five point six liters is actually five thousand six hundred milliliters so that is how we change liters into milliliters", "Gv5JFKMolpk": "hey guys welcome back today we're going to be doing another shotgun ballistics gel test in my last video I did a 12-gauge broad head shotgun slug and I wanted to go ahead and compare that to just your standard 1 ounce rifled hollow-point slug so what we're going to be shooting today is the Winchester 12-gauge 2 and 3/4 inch 1 ounce hollow-point slug the velocity on these is 1600 feet per second the shotgun I'll be using once again is my Benelli supernova 12-gauge pump-action shotgun and as always the gel block we'll be using is my clear ballistics 20% ballistics gel block so I'm gonna go ahead and go out and set everything up and we will run the test [Applause] [Music] all right so here's the entrance to our foster slug on the left that little red thing it's from the broad head slug I did before and you can see the just devastating wound Channel again the one on the right over here is from the broad head slug but the foster slug stopped much shorter and had a much bigger wound channel and broke apart there's one piece there in the middle and one piece stopped right there you can see over here it started to break through the side of the gel block [Music] so here's our one ounce foster slug it looks like the furthest piece stopped right at eight inches and the first piece that broke off stopped at about four inches again with it just a devastating temporary wound cavity from all that energy all right guys this is what I was able to recover from the 1 ounce hollow-point slug this looks like it's probably half of it the other half I'm not sure what happened to it I think I had it I lost it honestly but that is a pretty good chunk of it I mean that's a heavy piece of lead and then some of this paper from the wad is all I was able to recover of that one ounce hollow-point slug well that's it guys I hope you enjoyed the video quite a different result from the broadhead slug that we did in the last video that one passed all the way through the gel whereas the hollow-point slug in this video just kind of stopped probably less than halfway into the gel however the wound channel from the hollow-point slug was it's much bigger and it just looked like it you know had a lot more energy than the broadhead slug did so they're both devastating rounds both you know 12-gauge shotgun slugs pretty much anything out of the 12-gauge is going to be devastating except for birdshot and yeah they're just super impressive and you know super-powerful rounds so if you have any questions or anything else you'd like to see just go ahead and leave a comment for me thanks for watching and I'll see you next time", "5fYj8aHjBuk": "hi my name is Maria and I'm a mathematician and today I'm going to show you an easy way to remember how many pints are in a gallon so I'm going to draw a big G to represent a gallon and if you can remember this picture then you can always remember your conversions so I'm going to draw 4 Q's in this big G of mine my G stood 4 gallon and my Q's are going to stand four quarts so that means there's 4 quarts in every gallon now when every Q I want you to draw two peas and each P is going to stand for a pint so there's two pints in every court now your question was how many pints are in a gallon so what I have to do is count up how many peas I drew in this huge G and there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 that means there are 8 pints in every one gallon and you can use this big G to find different conversions between quarts and gallons also right there's 4 Q's in 1 gallon so there's 4 quarts in 1 gallon and there's 2 pints in 1 Q so there's 2 peas and 1q means that there's 2 pints in 1 quart so if you can remember that big G you can remember that there are 8

Now long ago Jeremiah, the prophet, had said that Israel's exile would last for seventy years and that afterwards God would restore his presence to a new temple and bring his kingdom and the rule of the Messiah over all nations. The dates at the beginning of this book tell us that those seventy years are almost up. But life back in the land was hard, and it seems like none of these promises were going to come true. why? And the book of Zechariah offers an explanation. It has a fairly clear design, there is an introduction, which sets the tone for a large collection of Zechariah\u00b4s dream visions and that's concluded by chapter 7 and 8. And then this is followed by two more large collections of poetry and prophecy let's just dive in and see how the book works. It begins with Zechariah\u00b4s challenge to his generation to turn back to God and not be like their ancestors who rebelled and refused to listen to the earlier prophets Which landed them in exile And so now the returned exiles respond positively to Zechariah they repent and humble themselves before God or so it seems. The next large section is a collection of eight nighttime visions that Zechariah experiences and just to prepare you, these are full of very bizarre strange images, a lot like your dreams. The idea that God communicates to people through symbolic dreams is very old and goes back to the book of genesis The dreams of Jacob or Joseph of Pharaoh, these gave meaning to current events at the time, but they also gave a window into the future and so Zechariah has his own dreams now and they've been arranged in this cool symmetrical design. The first and the last visions are about four horsemen each they are like rangers patrolling the world on God\u00b4s behalf and it's a representation of God's attentive watch over the nations the report is  that the world is at peace and in Zechariah's day this refers to how God raised up Persia to conquer Babylon and bring peace. And so the question now arises, the seventy years of Israel's exile are almost up is now the time for the messianic kingdom in Jerusalem and God responds by saying that he is determined to fulfill those promises but he leaves the question of timing unaswererd the second and seventh visions are paired because they're both reflections on Israel's  past sin, that led up to the exile. So, the second vision is about these horns, that symbolize the nations that attacked and then scattered Israel. Assyria and Babylon But then these horns or empires are themselves scattered by a group of blacksmiths an image for Persia. The seventh dream is about a woman in a basket and we are told she is a symbol of the centuries of israel\u00b4s covenant rebellion and then this woman is carried off to babylon by other women who carry the basket flying with stork wings this is so strange. The third and sixth visions are paired as they're both about the rebuilding of a new Jerusalem so a man is measuring the city, it's an image of God's promise that Jerusalem will be rebuilt and become a beacon to the nations who will join God\u00b4s people in worship and then the sixth dream is about a scroll that flies around the new Jerusalem punishing thieves and liars the idea being that the new Jerusalem is a place that\u00b4s purified from sin by the scriptures the fourth and fifth visions are at the center of these collection, and they're about the two key leaders among the returned exiles so Joshua,  the high priest, and then Zerubbabel the royal descendant of David. So Joshua, had been symbolically wearing Israel\u00b4s sin in the form of theses dirty clothes but then those are taken off and he's given new clothes and a new turban, a symbol of God's grace and forgiveness. and then an angel tells Joshua that if he remains faithful to God, he will lead his people and Joshua will become a symbol of the future messianic king The other vision is about two olive trees that supply oil to this elaborate gold lamp which itself is a symbol of God\u00b4s watchful eye over his people and these two trees symbolize the two anointed leaders: Joshua and then Zerubbabel who's leading the temple rebuilding efforts and God says that success will not come to this new temple if it's only the result only of  political maneuvering rather these two leaders must be dependant upon the work of God\u00b4s spirit The visions come to a close with a bonus vision from the prophet and it picks up the themes of the central fourth and fifth visions it's Joshua the high priest again and he's given a crown and presented as a symbol of the future messiah who will also be a priest over God's kingdom and then Zechariah closes it all out saying that all of these visions will be fulfilled only if the current generation is faithful to God and obeys the  terms of the covenant. And so altogether  these three visions emphasize how the coming of the messianic kingdom is conditional upon these generation being faithful to God which leads to the conclusion of the dreams it's another challenge from Zechariah and a group of Israelites come and they've been mourning over the former temple\u00b4s destruction for nearly seventy years and they ask him:\" is it time to stop grieving? I mean it's God's kingdom going to come very soon?\" and Zechariah again reminds them of how their ancestors rejected God's call through the prophets which led to the exile, and so he challenges them too. He says:\"this generation will see the messianic kingdom only if they pursue justice and peace and remain faithful to the covenant So, in other words Zechariah reverses their question. He asks are you going to become the kind of people who are ready to receive and participate in God\u00b4s coming kingdom and that question is left just hanging there, the people don\u00b4t answer and the book just moves on And so we come to the final sections that are very different from chapters one to eight Each section is a kaleidoscopic collage of poems and images about the future messianic kingdom so the first one chapters nine to eleven, describe the coming of the humble messianic king who's riding a donkey into the new Jerusalem to establish God's kingdom over the nations but then, all of a sudden, this king, he is symbolized as a shepherd over the flock of Israel, and then he\u00b4s rejected first by his own people, but then also by their leaders who are also symbolized as shepherds and so God hands Israel over to these corrupt shepherds and it raises the question will Israel's rejection of their king last forever? and the final section, chapters twelve to fourteen say no. It\u00b4s another mosaic of poems and images about the future messianic kingdom and they depict the new Jerusalem as place where God's justice will finally confront and defeat evil among the nations. it\u00b4s very similar to the  same themes in prophet Joel or Ezekiel But then God also will confront the rebellion within the hearts of his own people He\u00b4s going to pour out his spirit on them. He says, so  that they can repent and grieve over the fact that they have rebelled and rejected their messianic shepherd The final chapter concludes with the new Jerusalem. That\u00b4s the gathering point for all of the nations And then this city becomes a new garden of eden, and there\u00b4s a river of living water flowing out  of the temple bringing healing to all of creation and that's how the book ends. And so Zechariah just leaves you to ponder the connection between  chapters one thru eight and nine to fourteen and the point seems to be that this future messianic kingdom of the book's second half will only come when God's people are faithful to the covenant the point of the first half. Reading the book of Zechariah is a wild ride. These visions and poems  are full of starling imagery and they do not follow a linear flow of thought and that's part of the point. It\u00b4s like history and our lives, it doesn't always fit into neat orderly paterns but the prophets offer us glimpses of God's hand at work guiding history towards its own purposes and so ultimately Zechariah invites us to look above the chaos and hope for the coming of God's kingdom which should motivate faithfulness in the present and that's what the book of Zechariah is all about.",

over 12 and 21 over 28 now let's write each fraction in lowest terms we divide the numerator and the denominator of 9/12 by 3 we get the equivalent fraction 3/4 which is in lowest terms if we divide the numerator and the denominator of 21:28 by 7 we get the equivalent fraction 3/4 which is in lowest terms notice that 3/4 is equal to 3/4 so 9 to 12 must be equal to 21 to 28 so our two ratios are equal", "40o82o3uNfk": "in this video we're gonna talk about quartiles the deciles and percent house so what are they exactly quarts house divides the data into four equal parts what I like to think about is quarters for quarters adds up to one dollar now let's draw a number line and we're going to go from 0 to 100 but let's divide the number line into four equal parts so this is the first part second third and the fourth part this is q1 this is q2 and here we have q3 or the third quartile on the left this is the zero percentile the first quartile is the 25th percentile the second quartile is the 50th percentile and the third quartile is the 75th percentile and this goes up to 100% house divides the data into a hundred equal parts think of percentage 100 percent represents the total of everything q2 is basically the median of the entire data q1 is the median of the lower half of the data and q3 is the median of the upper half of the data now let's talk about des House des \u00eeles divide the data into 10 equal parts think of a decimeter a decimeter is basically once half of a meter which means that it takes 10 decimeters to equal one meter so when you hear the word deci think of @f so a Dessau is basically once half of the data so it takes 10 des \u00eeles to cover the entire data so let's break up this data into ten equal parts so this is going to be d1 this is D 0 D 2 D 3 is the third decile d 4 the fourth decile now q 2 is the same as d 5 and this is d6 d7 d 8 d 9 d 10 so what you need to know for instance is d 4 represents the 40th percentile in this example d 5 is the 50th percentile which is the same as the second quartile so we can write the percentage of valleys here so d1 is the 10th percentile d2 is the 20th percentile d3 is the 30th d 4 is the 40th d 6 is the 60th and so forth so d 9 will be the 90th percentile so now you can visually see how quartiles des \u00eeles and percentiles divide the data into different equal parts now what is the meaning of a percentile have you thought about that the 70th percentile for example is a data point where 70% of the entire data is less than or equal to the data point now it can also mean that 30% of the data is greater than or equal to the data point so what it will mean let's use the visual example so this would be zero this would be 70 and this would be a hundred so let's say if you took the SAT exam and your score ranks among the 70th percentile so your scores right here now 70% of students how to score that as equal to or less than your score so basically you scored better than 70% of the students who took the SAT at that time however 30% of the students who took the SAT did equal to or better than you did on the exam and so that's what the 70 percentile tells you it tells you that 70 percent of the data is less than the 70 percentile but thirty percent of the data is greater than this any of percentile or it could be equal to it as well so now you know the meaning behind a percentile now let's say if we have the numbers 2 3 5 7 8 10 11 13 15 16 and 19 how can we find a 3 quarts house in this list of numbers so what is the first second and third quartile the best thing to do is to find the second quarts offers the second quartile is basically the median of the entire data set and so let's find a middle number we can eliminate the first two and then the last June until we get the number in the middle which in this case is 10 so I'm going to get rid of the 10 I'm going to separate the data into two equal parts I'm going to put the 10 right here so 10 is our Q 2 value that is the median of the entire data set Q 1 is the median of the lower half of the data set so Q 1 is five as you could see five is the middle number of these five four numbers now what about Q 3 Q 3 is the median of the upper half of data set so the middle number is 15 so that is the third quartile now it turns out that there's another way in which we can calculate q1 q2 and q3 use in percentiles keep in mind q1 is basically the value of the 25th percentile to find the location of a percentile it's equal to K divided by a hundred times n plus 1 so n is basically the number of data items in your list or the number of numbers in the set K is basically the subscript so if you want to find the 25th percentile K is 25 so let's illustrate this with an example so let's find the location of the 25th percentile so it's gonna be 25 divided by 100 and there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 numbers in the list so n is 11 so let's get the answer what is 25 over a hundred a hundred divided by 25 is 4 so 25 divided by 100 is 1/4 and 11 plus 1 is 12 so we have 12 divided by 4 which is dream so what does this number tell us the 3 indicates that the first quartile is in the third position it's the third item from the left so this is the first item this is the second item this is the third item so the third number from the left is five which is our first quartile as we can see here and so that's how you supposed to use the formula now let's try another example let's calculate the second quartile so the second quartile is basically the fiftieth percentile which we know to be 10 so let's determine the location of the 50th percentile so it's K divided by 100 or 50 divided by 100 times n plus 1 so n is not going to change it's still 11 for this list so 50 divided by 100 that's basically point five or we could say it to run over to 11 plus 1 is 12 half of 12 is 6 so the second quartile is basically the sixth item from the left so this is the fourth item this is the fifth item that we can see here this is the sixth item which is 10 and so that is the second quartile if you wish to calculate the 3rd quartile and it's basically the 75th percentile which we know to be 15 so using the same formula we're gonna calculate the location of the 75th percentile so it's 75 over a hundred times 11 plus 175 over a hundred if you divide both numbers by 25 you could reduce it to three over four now twelve divided by four is three times the three on top that gives us nine so 3/4 of twelve is nine so the knife data point in this case is going to be 15 which is the third quartile let's try another example so this time we have an even number of items in his list so let's determine the first second and the third quartile so let's split the data into two equal parts so here we have eight numbers on the left and eight numbers on the right so this time the median is going to be the average of 15 and 16 if we add those two numbers and then divide by 2 this will give us the midpoint or the average of those numbers which is 15 point 5 so that is our second quartile now to find a first quartile we need to find the middle number of the numbers on the left now they're even so we're gonna split it here so that we have 4 on the Left 4 on the right so the median is going to be the average of 9 and 11 9 plus 11 is 20 divided by 2 that's 10 so 10 is the first quartile now let's split the data on the right into 2 equal parts and so the average of 19 and 20 is going to be nineteen point five nineteen point five is right in the middle of 19 and 20 so that's our third quartile now let's see if we can calculate that using the same process that we did before so let's calculate the location of the 25th percentile so it's K divided by 100 in which case K is 25 and there's 16 numbers in this list we have 4 4 4 and 4 so n is 16 so this is going to be 16 plus 1 so it's run 4th of 17 now 17 divided by 4 that is not going to give us a whole number in fact we're gonna get a decimal number so what is the 4.25 value well that's hard to tell when you get a situation like this you need to round up and down you need to look at the fourth value and the fifth value so this is the first second third fourth fifth value the fourth value is nine and the fifth value is eleven so if you average four and five it will give you ten I mean if you average nine and eleven it will give you ten and so this is the location well the location of the twenty-fifth percentile is this number but the value of the 25th percentile is 10 which is q1 so that's how you could use this formula to help get you this answer now let's use the same process to calculate q3 so q3 is the 75th percentile which has a value of nineteen point five so let's determine the location of the 75th percentile so it's 75 divided by 100 times 16 plus 1 so it's 3/4 of 17 17 times three divided by four is twelve point seven five so this is six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen so we can see that twelve point seven five is between these two numbers so it's gonna make sense to average them so when you get a number like this you need to identify the twelfth value which is nineteen in this case as we see here and the thirteenth of value which is twenty and so the 75th percentile is going to be the average of the 12th and the 13th value so we're gonna take nineteen and add it to 20 and then divide by 2 so we get 39 divided by 2 which is nineteen point five here's another example using this list of numbers let's say if we want to calculate the value of the six Dessau how can we do so the six decile is basically the 60th percentile and so first we need to calculate the location of the 60th percentile so it's gonna be 60 divided by 100 times 16 plus 1 so it's basically point six times 17 which is ten point two so the 60th percentile is going to be the average of the Tefnut and the eleventh number because 10 point two is between the tenth and the eleventh number and then we're going to divide it by two so the tenth value we could see at 16 and the eleventh value is 17 the midpoint between 16 and 17 is sixteen point five so this is the 60th percentile based on the data that we have here that is of course if we follow the same process as we've been doing however I'm inclined to think that the 60th percentile is based on the tenth value in the list well for one thing 10 is very close to ten point two and a 10 value in the list is 16 and here's why I'm inclined to think about it intuitively the second quartile is the 50th percentile the third quartile is the 75th percentile so it's clear to see that our answer should be somewhere in its region so 16 point five is not a bad estimate however if we split this in the middle the midpoint between 50 and 75 if you add them up and divide by 2 that should give you sixty two point five and 60 is to the left of sixty two point five which puts it more closer to 16 and then to 17 now granted the calculations will not be perfect because n is small but as you increase your n value as you increase the number of numbers in a list these calculations become more accurate so keep that in mind now there's something else that we can do with this list of numbers so far we talked about finding the value of a percentile for instance the value of the 50th percentile is fifteen point five but what if we're given the value how can we find the percentile that corresponds to that value so let's use let's use twelve for example now we know that 12 is between the twenty-fifth percentile and the 50th percentile would you say this is the 30th percentile the 40th percentile the 35th percentile what would you say well if we're going to Ballpark in the average between 25 and 50 is thirty seven point five so it makes sense that twelve is between the twenty-fifth percentile and the 37.5% but let's see if we can do some math to get the answer to find it you could use this formula it's X plus point five Y divided by n times 100 so what is X in this formula X is the number of numbers that is less than 12 so all these numbers are less than 12 so there's five numbers less than 12 thus X is 5 y is the number of times this number appears there's only one 12 so why it's gonna be 1 if there were two 12s Y would be 2 now n is the number of numbers in the list we know we have a total of 16 numbers we got 4 in each quadrant and then we're gonna multiply everything by 100 so this is basically 5.5 divided by 16 times 105.5 divided by 16 is 0.34 375 so times 100 this is 34 point 375 now let's Rob it then there's whole number so therefore we could say that the 34th percentile is equal to 12 or we could say that 12 is the 34th percentile and thus that is how we could find it and it makes sense because 34 is between 25 and 37 point 5 so that's a good approximation let's try another example what about the number 16 the knife data point in the list what is the percentile that corresponds to that number now we know it's going to be between 50 and 60 to 45 but feel free to pause the video and calculate the answer there's no need for me to retype that formula so P of what subscript number is equal to the first 16 that we see well first let's determine X X is the number of items that is less than this 16 value so notice that we have eight numbers to the left of this number so the x value is 8 now why is the number of times 16 appears because 16 is the number that we're focused on notice that there's two 16 in this case it's going to be two and it's still 16 and then times 100 so point 5 times 2 is 1 plus 8 that's not so this is going to be 9 over 16 times 100 and so this is going to be fifty six point two five and so we're going to round this 256 so 16 is the 56 percentile or we can say that the 56 percentile is equal to 16 now does this answer make sense well let's see 16 is between 50 and 62 point five and 56 is between 50 and 62 point five so saying that the first 16 is the 56 percentile is reasonable it makes sense based on the data that we see here now there's one more thing we need to talk about and that is the ability to make a cumulative relative frequency table and then to use it in order to calculate percentile values so let's work on this example let's create a cumulative relative frequency table and then let's calculate the fourth the seventh the third and the six deaths out the order so to make a cumulative relative frequency table we need four columns the first one will contain the value the second will be the frequency the third will be the relative frequency and the fourth column will contain the cumulative the relative frequency values so the lowest value in this list is two now how many times does 2 appear one two times so the frequency is 2 now the next highest value is a 3 so we have one two three four threes in this list now the next value in the list is 4 so we have one two three four x' analyst next up we don't have a five but the next number is a six and so there's only two sixes that I've counted now we do have a 7 only one of them the next number is a nine and there's one two three four five nines I'm gonna need some extra space here and then we have a ten it turns out we have two tenths and the last number is a 12 but there's only one 12 now our next step is to take the sum of the frequency column so 2 plus 4 is 6 plus 3 is 9 plus 2 is 11 and then 12 17 19 20 so this tells us that we have a total of 20 items in our list the next step is to calculate the relative frequency to do this take the frequency and divided by the total frequency when the total number of items two divided by 20 is point ten 4/20 that's gonna be point twenty three divided by 20 is point fifteen two divided by 20 is point ten one divided by 20 is point zero five five divided by 20 that's point two five and two over twenty point ten one over twenty s point zero five now if you add all of these numbers you should get one point zero zero which are marked in red now let's calculate the cumulative relative frequency so first we're going to start with this number point 10 and then we're going to add point 10 and the next relative frequency which is point 20 so this is going to give us a point 30 and then add point 30 plus a point 15 so that's going to be point four five and then add point forty five plus point ten so that's point fifty five and then adding those two this is going to be point sixty point sixty plus 0.25 that's point eight five and point eight five plus point ten that's point nine five and then the last one it's going to be one when you add point nine five and point zero five so that's how you can calculate the cumulative relative frequency now let's use it to calculate the deciles that we have listed here so let's start with the four two Dessau D for the fourth deaths are we know to be the 40th percentile the 40th percentile corresponds to a cumulative relative frequency of point four notice that point four is somewhere between point three and point four five so here is a question for you will the 40th percentile be equal to three or will it be equal to four or will it be equal to the average of three and four which one of these three options is correct now you need to understand that the 30th percentile it ends with the last three out of the four threes that we have here and it begins with the first four out of the three fours that we have here so if you want to find the 30th percentile exactly it's really the average of three and four however if you want to find a percentile that is between two cumulative relative frequency values it's going to be the higher of the two numbers for is between a percentile of 30 and 45 the value 6 is between a percentile of 0.45 and point 555 or 45 and 55 so the the knife value or the value of 9 is between the 60th percentile and the 85th percentile but if you want to find let's say the 85th percentile it is the average of 1910 and I'm gonna explain why and visually so you can see it so because the 40th percentile is between these two numbers it's going to be for the 30th percentile ends with 3 but it begins before so the 44 Center has to equal 4 now what about the seventh Dessau or the 70th percentile what is the value that corresponds to that so the 70th percentile has a cumulative relative frequency of 0.7 which is between point sixty and point 95 now keep in mind the 60th percentile ends with seven and begins with nine so the 70th percentile has to be one of the five nines that we have here so it's going to equal 9 now what about the third Dessau so that's the thirtieth percentile notice that we do have an exact value here accumulative relative frequency of point three zero so point three or the 30% ow it ends with the last three and it begins with the first four so in this case it's going to be the average of those two numbers so the thirtieth percentile will be three point five now what about the six Desa or the 60th percentile notice that we have that exact number in our chart or in our table so this is going to be the average of these two the 60th percentile ends with the last seven and starts with the first five so the average of seven and nine I meant to say it ends with the last seven but starts with the first nine so that's the average of those two numbers is going to be eight now let's confirm these answers let's see if we can make sense of it so we said that the fourth Dessel is for the seventh desam is nine the third desam is three point five and the six desam is eight now let's go ahead and put this list in increasing order you could also use the cumulative relative frequency table that we had to do this as well so if you go back to it we said that we had two twos and we had four threes and we had two sixes we had a seven and we have five nines and then we have two tenths and we have run 12 it looks like I'm missing something I'm missing the force so let's go back there were three fours and then we had two sixes one seven and then five nines and then there were two tens and a twelve so notice that I'm grouping everything in pairs because I have 20 numbers and I wanted to divide it into ten equal parts so you could see what the des \u00eeles are so this is gonna be the first SL this is the second third fourth fifth six seven eight nine ten and we could say this is zero so let's start with the fourth Dessau which we said was four so here's d4 notice to the left is the four and to the right it's a four so the fourth decile or the 40th percentile is four so because they were the same we didn't really have to average any numbers now let's talk about the seventh decimal so here's the seventh s out to the left we have a nine to the right we had a 9 so as we could see it's one of the five 9s that we have in our list so this answers accurate now the third Dessau is between two different numbers as we could see here it ends with the last three and it begins with the first four so that's we average three and four and get 3.5 now the situation is the same for the six Dessau as we could see it ends with the last seven and begins with the first line so it's the average of seven and nine given us eight so hopefully that makes sense and now you have a better understanding of quartiles deciles and percentiles and you know how to find them given a list of numbers thanks for

talk about custo carts that's right i am not ape just so you know and you probably do i'm not a big cartridge person i use my own blend i use distill it a lot and syringes and make my own however when i find somebody that can prove to me that their product is prepared the right way has the right materials in it and isn't going to give me any carcinogens associated with cartridges i'll use it this is custer cart custom cart and what i've done i've checked them out and i expect all of you will also that's right what we're looking for is not just flavor anymore this is a delta eight cartridge one is gorilla glue and one is ice cream cake both delta eight ninety four percent thc this is by marin analytics signed by their chief scientist why am i doing this why am i doing this because mrs stoner likes cartridges okay standard cartridge packaging but the difference is it's delta eight okay and there's a big thing going on now in our industry about delta eight and what it can do for you and how it's just a little bit different so what i think we want to do is taste it delta eight distillate analysis okay here we go five clicks on this is a standard c cell battery cheers everybody very tasty i make my own blend but this is tasty stuff very tasty this is the ice cream cake let's move off the ice cream cake onto gorilla glue gorilla glue is going to be a little bit more piney in flavor both one gram cartridges here we go definitely a little bit more piney so that the birthday cake you definitely had a little bit of a sweet taste with the gorilla glue you have more of that tangy piney i'll call it the traditional weed taste but both of these are also utilizing terps now i haven't seen a specific breakdown of the terps that are in here but there are terps in here and i'll say this when you're looking for cartridges today you need to remember no glycerin no vitamin e find out the process by which they extract okay i found out i'm happy this is a good brand so if you're looking for cartridges it's custic custom carts c-u-s-t-i custa carts give them a try very tasty thanks for watching hope you enjoyed this discussion of our gorilla glue and birthday cake custard carts have a great day everybody and you must check your cartridges make sure the content you're smoking cheers", "xW82yST1dGw": "hello you may already know that in Microsoft Word if you want to type a half you can simply type 1 / 2 and then when you press space it's automatically corrected to show a fraction the same is true if you were to type in say 3 / 4 3 quarters but if you want to type something that's a little different say 7-elevens it doesn't update it doesn't show that as a fraction in the same way but it is possible to show fractions in Microsoft Word such as these two here custom fractions how do you do that in this short video I'll show you how you do that so to insert a custom fraction the first thing we need to do is head to the insert tab here once you've gone to insert go right the way to the right hand side and you'll find the equation button click on a little pie symbol the top here and that'll bring up a new toolbar which possibly you've never seen before with a whole load of interesting symbols and features that you can use we'll use the fraction button which is just here in the middle and if we click on that you'll see a drop-down list of different fraction types so for example here we have the stacked fraction and if I click on that what happens is it brings up this form that it has if you like two text boxes one at the top and one at the bottom if I click on the one at the top I can type in whatever my top number is and then I can click underneath and click on that little dotted square type in whatever the second number will be the bottom number and that's it once I've clicked on that I'm done and I can start now writing the rest of my document with that fraction night nicely vertically aligned centrally to the line of text I'm using so that's how to write a fraction that stacked a vertical one we can see that the process for skewed fraction is just the same so we go to insert equation and then I can click on this fraction tab in the middle and choose let's say the skewed fraction here the second option click on that and again I simply type in whatever my top number is type in there once I click on that gray square the bottom what my bottom number is and that's it job done I now have my skewed fraction and you have some options here as well for example if I click on this right hand menu drop down menu here I can change the display I can change the different appearances so I can change that to inline professional and so forth so you can change the alignment you can change that a little bit you can also if you click on this form here and you click on this button at the top left little tab with three dots in it and you can select the whole fraction and then you can change certain things to do with the text formatting such as the font size and the font color and the alignment so that's how to insert a basic custom fractions into Microsoft Word and do some basic formatting on them I hope you found that useful and interesting if you did please do consider subscribing so that your first to know about new videos that are released and it will be fantastic if you could consider giving this video a little like or a

motorcycle so here's a little advice on how to mix your oil with your fuel so first of all you want to know what ratio to use now that's a dark part you want to go on the internet and everybody's arguing about which is best the manual says 24 to one but the people on the internet say if you use that you're going to file out your plugs and that's way too much oil and then the guy who gave me the bike told me to run forty to one and your internet people are going to say generally forty to one if you do light trail riding and then down to 32 to one if you're really revving it out and then the way that you measure it is you get one of these measuring buckets and this has got all of the correct ratios on it so if you've got two gallons you just fill it up to here to get a forty to one mix or you fill it up to here to get a thirty-two to one mix or somewhere in between if you want to go in between so what I like to do is put the gas in the actual tank of the motorcycle and then once I know how much it is then calculate how much oil to dump into it that way I don't have to have a special two-stroke gas can I can just mix it in with tank of the motorcycle obviously you want to know how much you're putting in the tank so if you do it at a gas station that's the ideal way because that way you can fill it up otherwise I just go to the gas station get a gallon or gal and a half dump it in there and then dump the oil in on top of it shake it around and it mixes up real good this is got this @ cycle gear quick mix oil gas mixer $5.99 I'm sure there's a lot of different ones otherwise you're walking around with a shot glass or a measuring cup dumping oil in making a big mess this is just a lot cleaner way to do it and then if you're running a mixture and you can't remember what the mixture is it's good to just put the number on the side of the bike that way to run thirty to one you always know just look at the big number thirty and that's how you mix it all right there we go there's the mix looking at 42 one gallon and a half I give a little bit of bonus oil in there to get it somewhere between 40 and 32 just to be safe down the hatch then rock it shake it shake it up to mix the oil and then you're good smoke", "6yVnwr2RNO8": "they knew about Saudis how creamy will you be chicken food chicken chicken ba na na we just not allowed well I'm like wow that's great Sheffield John my second one saying Merry Christmas when it comes I'm happy and prosperous new year for you and yours right now you know what time it is I want to show you how I prepare my Jamaican black key fruit key I know some of us make our Christmas key or are talking about the city so no further delay I'm going to take you right into this video whoa hold on gonna deal a bit how do you subscribe that's it hit that subscribe button because we're don't talk about 78 videos as we speak with nothing but goodness a subscribe for Olympics Jamaica Caribbean and international food and this is what the kid should look like when you bake it so I'm gonna show a potted creep is beautiful Jamaican Christmas key Wow let me show you one more so we're gonna start off by creaming together or sugar or butter right a good way to have your butter cream dog properly is to take this out overnight and as you can see it's pretty soft so this is at room temperature so the packages that we took no butter from do not show those away we're gonna use them later to grease or vacant it all right so we're gonna soften the butter first before we add our sugar so now we're gonna add our sugar cause about has a bit beaten they're using pure brown sugar here we're gonna cream this until about time sugar becomes fluffy we'll start off on low speed and gradually increase the speed reason being we don't want this to splash all over the place so while that is going to go degrees our bacon taste so remember those pockets that we got the water from come in handy with those winner of the right over 0 W is anything extra to ensure that your quota right Tyrone properly Jenny some grease paper are wax paper in the skirt we just want to stop that for a second and scrape the side are you bored on cause I realize you still have sugar that's not incorporated as it or just what a foolish all right in that before put a few slices door at the end go far away over to the sides on first release now are what gonna have to stick them to the end what I did I'll bring that all right Tyrone so at the end of the paper here I set up both ends and then we're going to put the bottom in and that is how you're lying you're baking tree [Music] so this is what you're looking for Jesse hold up bata and sugar transform beautifully it's almost like icing basically but with brown sugar normally we'll use lime zest for this recipe but if you have lemon zest that's perfectly fine as well just ensure that they get some zester I'm going to use a smallest part of your grater or if you have zester that's perfectly fine so that directly into the eggs and what this does is the odd flavor to the egg as well as to cut away in a run is so that the heat doesn't taste raw because if you have this much eggs in a cake you're guaranteed that it's going to chase a barrage we're going to lightly beat this before we add it to the cream to butter and sugar right now so that's perfect at this point you want to turn on your oven to preheat at 350 degrees Fahrenheit gradually add your eggs into your creamy mixture and fold it in well and the reason why I gradually add it because you don't want to make sure to curdle right so I did fold it in properly and then I'm so gonna add this about five to six times so it started off here at very low speed again just to prevent splashing Godfather so gonna gradually add to this or browning you can also use burnt sugar and brown in this car karma so just gonna add that to give it that black cake look okay so now this is done so I mixed your curdled just a little bit but it's fine right Turner's gonna set this aside and then we're gonna go over to our dry ingredients if your mixture Carlos that doesn't mean your cake is for it's still good to go somebody sift my flour to that I'm gonna add cinnamon powder so that I use a spice or mixed rice so the auspices contained of nutmeg cinnamon and cloves but we use the Ozzfest because we want that clove flavor in our key even though we have a repeat of the cinema I do not mix olive oil it's our baking powder and salt I'm just gonna see if this just remove the lumps from the flour as well as to get it light and airy [Music] so what was too small to edit in that all of our big enough both to do that if I have a big enough voted off to constantly be transferring you need to mix this to incorporate all these ingredients together I'm gonna add four separate board the mix fruits and I have a video on how to prepare the mixed fruits forest cake so you can click that link above and it take you right over there scream that we use and not know is you know the rest burner we're gonna add your fruit mix some rose water and vanilla just gonna mix that in whoa the flipper birds that just hit me unreal so something I should have mentioned to you earlier as soon as I get your oven preheated what you can do is set your kettle on to boil some water because you're gonna set a water bath in the oven and what this does is to prevent Nikki from general quickly and also burning so you don't get that what am i under Laura and then your cake above it I'm just gonna add that right into the fruits just gonna mix those in food incorporate that with the fruits if you have a big enough KitchenAid mixer you don't have to do this transfer process you can just add your fruits in your mixer but because I don't have a big enough mixer for that I'm just finishing tough or school style you know then for the finale we're gonna go in with our dry ingredients gonna gradually add this and fold it in and ensure not to over mix this as soon as everything is folding you're good to go circular motion in circular motion in soon as our flour deserve add a bit more so I listened about portions of four [Music] this is not up to the color that I want it's gonna add a bit more Brown into that you can also use our whisk if you don't have a wooden spoon so there you have it we don't want to over mix this and a batter should be this thick so you're good to go when I add that straight into a prepared baking tray top that down on the counter to get everything level and to remove whatever ear bubbles may be underneath this should yield you a 12 inch cake but I went in with a 10-inch pan right and I have a bit over so the remainder in cupcake form this cupcake size would be about 25 to 30 minutes on this 10 inch cake will bake for an hour and 30 minutes so after an hour and 30 minutes I'll show you what it looks like so far let me show you our one so here we have our what about I will just wanna set Turkey right above that and this prevents it from drying off so now it's time to remove our cake from the oven but I get that knife and insert that's in the very center of the key and you pull that out and look at that if your knife comes out clean you're ready to go if not you pop that back in the oven for an additional five minutes on your monitor it doesn't burn so in this bottle I have some white rock red label wine and fruit wine and this is what we're going to use to spray on our cake to get to moisten you just going to spritz on your keep while it's hot so that the tip absorbs the alcohol so this is the exact size that I big prior to this one and this is what your case should look like when it's done already sprayed by our quality looking moist and this was built two days ago she notices well infused with alcohol just gonna cut into that to show you what it looks like cut so nicely that is what you're looking for decadent rich firm and moist I'm very

Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be. They think you some kind of God. The man who returned from the dead. You're Ned Stark's bastard. Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow? I saw... I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. You're telling me you saw one of them. Thousands of years ago The first men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I'm gonna fight for the side That fights for the living. So long they'll ask you once, Lord Snow. Do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne? No. Good. Because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond The Wall tomorrow. Bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the Ancient Order of the Nights Watch. You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father some. I don't care about that. You might. If you know what it meant. Uncle Benjen! Great War is coming. I still fight for the living. Ride for the pass. Do what I can. As long as I can. And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow? He's the prince that was promised. He's name is Aegon Targaryen. Run and fight! That's why we all agreed to follow him. That's the kind of man he is. Strong enough to befriend an enemy and get murdered for it. For the Watch. John snow avenged The Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. Comes back. Keeps fighting Here And North of the Wall and then back here again. He keeps fighting. He keeps fighting. He climbed on the fucking dragon and fought. What kind of person climbs on a fucking dragon? A mad man or a King! King in the North! I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms. I don't have love here. I only have fear. Let it be fear. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? Every time a Targaryen is born the Gods flip a coin. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours. Targaryen. Alone in the world. So terrible thing. You will find little joy in your command. But With luck You will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Get back! Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Kill a little boy. And let the man be born. It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Have you seen? Children Little children Burned! Fall back! Love is the death of duty. Sometimes Duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the Realms of Men. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. You've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost. You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arm? We do not choose our destiny. But we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet Sooner or later In every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose. I had a choice. Lord Commander. It's time. If I had to do it all over knowing where I end up, I'd pray I'd make the right choice again. And you have to choose now. The most make that choice yourself. Be with me. And live with it for the rest of your days. We do it together. As I have. We break the wheel Together. I did what I thought was right. Was it right? Murdered for it. What I did. What does it matte- *sighs* You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of their shit as you can. Would you? Lord Snow. You'll be fighting their battles forever. I fought And I lost. I failed. Good. Now go fail again. You and I won't find much joy while we're here, but we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.

to mix a two to one ratio now this is something that I found super difficult when I didn't know this so I just look on the each column so this is two to one we have three two one four two one five two one six two one seven two one and ten to one so we need a two to one so we only look in this column and on this column I'm not sure if you can see here but it says a B on each individual column within this column maybe it's better this way you guys sorry for example this is the column we're looking at at the moment so in this column the two to one column we have three separate columns and this is just basically and for the mixes you want to do so we want to do a big mix so we go to the you know that the largest of them all so we put the first part which is the primer to that to the a - and then the B - is the hardener so this is the the two-part primer one part hardener and then it's got 10% and 20% so that this represents the diluting if you want to dilute it which we will be doing by 10% so we're going to put primer a then B for the hardener and then up to the 10% for the dilute on you so for the diluting guys I'm going to be using the same product by the same manufacturer sorry so I don't really recommend mixer shake first guys this is the primer we're going to tip this into the furthest the biggest color all the way up to that eh almost there keep clean guys always ours obviously this is wild looks super messy so just quickly show you that guys so we're up to the first up to the first Ida if you can see so then we need to come up to this B and then 10% of dilute um and other hard that goes in to the B and now the dilute Sun will go into the 10% right guys so up to the 10% I'll call the saying guys I'm super maxi so there we go guys give this a mix now okay okay guys so I'm pretty happy with that mix now so just wipe this off keep myself flame highly measurable already strangers we're ready to put this in a gun you you", "0ZaS-_kM-eM": "[Music] so [Music] hi i'm rick dior and today we're going to talk about playing in odd times particularly a section for my book called circular grooves now in this section what we do is we set up an ostinato that's in 4 4 or 3 4 kind of a compound meter and we play an odd times over that most notably five eight and seven eight now these exercises are located in the book advanced coordination for drum set and hand percussion from pages 42 to 47. so we're going to start today by talking about playing in 5 8 and we're going to start pretty simple so if you go to page 46 and i'll post it on the screen here i'll show you how to start the first thing we're going to do is play these rhythms numbers 1 through 24 just with 8th notes on the hi-hat now i'm not going to go through all these rhythms we have limited time today but i'll go through some of them and then i will go through all the rhythms when i play some more complicated ostinatos but the goal here is to play a constant ostinato that will loop around every five beats so if we put the metronome on 220 on eighth notes and we play the first couple exercises in five it sounds like this one two three four five [Music] so you see there i'm playing very simple eighth notes on the hi-hat nothing special but i am playing at five so that will be your first step to learning these of course you could do it much slower than that if you want a good starting tempo is probably about eighth note equals 190 to start these out with just make sure your hi-hat is even and you're relaxed and you're going to have to repeat these many many times now the next step is to start playing some of the ostinatos so the first one i recommend working on is number five hi-hat ostinato that will be on page 43. and you're gonna do that with your right hand on the hi-hat just doing this one two three four [Music] five [Music] so you see there i'm playing at 4 4 and it's looping so those upbeat hi-hats opens come every other bar and also i'm not opening my foot too much on that open and i'm playing the shaft on the open so like this so let's play through some of these at the same tempo eighth note equals 220. one two three four five [Music] so that's the first line now i'll play through some more for you so you can get the idea but that's how we're going to do that you can also go and play the open hi-hats on the bell of the symbol [Music] [Music] and then you would do something with your hi-hat so you do one of the foot high exercises in that case i just played page 45 number one all upbeats [Music] [Music] so let's try some of these with that open hi-hat pattern and i'll play through uh from line two all the way to the end so exercise five to twenty four i'll do each one four times one two three four five [Music] so that's how that sounds with that pattern now the next step would be going over to the symbol and playing something with your hi-hat with your foot so the easiest one to do would just be a splash pattern doing this so that would be hi-hat with foot number two and just eighth notes on the symbol we'll try a little of that let's just do start from number nine [Music] we could start getting pretty complicated here so if we play the hi-hat rhythm which is number 12 on page 43 then we start getting into some physical issues with your right hand so that looks like this so again that's turning around as you can see here every other bar and then playing these exercises becomes more difficult because they're more nodey why don't we start from number thirteen one two three four five [Music] [Music] so that i was playing eight times and then four times and that's the way i practice these sometimes i'll repeat them a lot if they feel a little bit stressed i'll do a whole bunch of times if i feel pretty good about everything i'll play through the whole page at once and that sounds like this [Music] so that would be the penultimate moment of playing these things all the way through another way to practice them is take like a text like louis belson's odd time reading text and just alternating those rhythms there's a lot of odd time rhythms in there and you could play hand foot hand foot that's something i also do when i get bored with these rhythms so now if we turn the page we see we're in seven eight and there's a lot more of these rhythms and they're more complex so one one ostimato i really like doing with my feet is a compound meter so i'll play in three like this so that's hi-hat foot pattern number seven and then on your ride you could just play eighth notes or something or do this what we just did on the hi-hat but i'll play eighth notes for now let me show you how this works what i'll do is i'll put the metronome in seven so i'll have a beep every seven clicks and i'll play my hi-hat and three over that [Music] so you see that i'm playing seven on top so that's how all of these are going to work now we'll play eighth notes here and i'll just play the first line so you can hear that [Music] [Music] so [Music] now you probably see my lips moving there i actually have to count these out and i suggest you do the same to make sure you're accurate it's easy when you're playing compound meters in other words one part of the kid's playing in one meter and the other part of kit is playing in another meter to lose track that's what the metronome's for but also count so it's embedded in your brain there so i'll play some of these for you and we'll do um maybe around 212 eighth note and we'll start at 17 and maybe do three or four lines so again listen for that 3 4 one two hi-hat [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so there you have that these are very syncopated so they're pretty difficult and you might not want to go this fast to start with but repetition here is the key to success so i'll play a little for you and then we'll call it a day thanks [Music] do [Music] so [Music] you", "bq0CEWQQ5BM": "hi there this is a wish on mo here and in this video tutorial I'm going to show you how to put your card back on to the default or factory default setting I received a number of emails asking me I have messed up the carp settings how do I put them back to the default or factory default setting for this thing I will be using a spare carb right here in my hands and I'm also going to show you the settings on redhead Racing's shockwave 1 by 10 scale nitro buggy and sandstorm 1 by 8 scale nitro buggy in addition I will also pick up one Eggman Monster t truck and try to show you some settings on that one as well let's get to work first I would like to show you some settings this is as such 21 pro engine here and here is the carb settings that you can see you can see that my high end is actually probably one or two turns 10 n so I'm going to open it completely to get it flush to edges and 1 2 3 that is the setting that my centrum is actually running very well there is the low end ball you can see it's just a tiny bit under the edges it's not completely flushed to the edges alright that's it let's let's check the shockwave my goodness dirty I was running it on a dirt track the other day but anyway we are here to see the shockwave settings you can see the shockwaves high end is almost flush to the edges it's just like - clockwise closed circles in and the low end you can see this low end is not completely or even close to flush to edges and shockwave is actually working very well on this set here we are with the ECMO monster t truck this truck is actually using a team infinity engine I'm going to post another video on this team infinity engine on how to tune it properly and run your truck or car because some guys are having trouble with team infinity engine with this blue top anyway here we are you can see the high end is set on this level this is probably three to four tons one two three that's flush two edges one two three that push the settings at the moment I was at now let's look at the low end and you can see it's flush two edges in fact a little bit out of the edge well this is the setting this monster t truck is running very well on this team infinity engine now that we have seen the settings on three different cars allow me to show you how to put your car back to the default or factory default settings alright here we are with a spare carb and I will show you how to put the card valves to their default position if you have messed it up so if you have messed everything up start off with the high end open it flush it to edges okay once it's flushed to edges from there it's a good point to start one two three circles clockwise once again edges one two three that's what a closed it clockwise rotation now this is a very good position to start off with and from here you can easily lean out your carb or your truck or your buggy engine or reaching it out remember once again when you close the high end clockwise your lean in your truck or your engine and when you counterclockwise open it you are returning the engine coming back to the low-speed wall now to set the low-speed valve to default position let's say it's just messed it up here and you are having troubles starting your engine what I would recommend is open it and flush it to edges there we go it's flush to edges now from here I would close it just one full circle clockwise and now I will start the engine after starting the engine I will do the pinch test to do the pinch test all you need to do when the engine is started and idling you will pinch the fuel line that is going to the car when you pinch the fuel tube the engine rpm should rise for a few seconds before the engine quit that means you are very close to a very good low involved setting on low speed needle setting now leave it here and see if you have a very good idea to partial throttle response if your ideal to partial throttle response is smooth and good you don't have to worry anymore otherwise make another tiny change that is just a tiny close you can see you can see I'm making a very tiny change close open close open close now when dealing with the low-speed needle make sure you always make very very tiny adjustment so if your pinch test is going real good you can just do a tiny bit close and see if you have good parsh good idle to partial throttle response in any case sometimes remember even this tiny setting or this tiny change will actually make a difference did you see that just this tiny change will actually make a difference on your setting so be very very careful with the low involved now that's it I think this is it that we have easily set our valves both of the walls which we have messed up to a factory default that's it folks I hope you have learned how to put your carb wall back to the default settings now go ahead if you are having any trouble just set your car back to the default position and start tuning the engine again from there thank you very much Alicia I'm out", "0rxzKAaap00": "welcome to conman cocktails I'm your host garyx over today I want to do a little more you know video on parts parts are often found in recipes where you have one let's say a two one one recipe and it's a two parts rum one part sour one part sweet what is a part mean here in the United States that might be houses if you're in New York that might be milliliters it could be teaspoons it could be any single type of measure you want I know some of our fans measure in parts that are 1 ounce increments like a shot glass the trick is this shot glass isn't one ounce it's two ounces so if you don't know your your measure you could end up in a weird situation but if you always use parts as a ratio as in two shot glasses of rum one shot glass of sour mix and one shot glass of sure you'll still get the same recipe it might be 500 milliliters to 500 milliliters it could be one truck to two trucks as long as you're using the same truck you're creating parts it doesn't matter what type of measuring device it is as long as you always use that same measuring device and use the ratios two of these to one of these but now from now on anytime you see parts put your favorite measurement in their cups ounces milliliters civil

"eRRlt8Kddug": "[Music] hello there and welcome in this video we are looking at Epsom salts and how to use them to treat constipated bloated fish or even though suffering with dropsy now Epsom salt is sometimes confused with another product called aquarium salt but please don't do this it's a completely different product aquarium salt is basically regular salt sodium chloride epsom salts however is something completely different its magnesium sulfate so two very different types of salt a lot of the positive things epsom salts does for humans also happens with fish so absent source is good at reducing swelling it's very good laxative which is why we use them to treat certain disorders in fish now when you buy epsom salts make sure that you're getting a hundred percent or as close to it cure epsom salts as possible and make sure it doesn't have any added chemicals such as sense or fragrances so if your fish is a little bit fat or it hasn't paid for a while or maybe it's very round and it's scales are sticking out from the side of its body then epsom salts is a good thing to add either to your aquarium to passively treat some of the symptoms that your fish are suffering or you can even give your fish a direct bath where you remove it from the aquarium and put it into a higher concentration of epsom salts for a small amount of time the idea of this is that the magnesium sulfate will draw out some of the swelling from the fish and hopefully if the problem is caused by a constipation issue it will help your fish to go to toilet now disorders in fish such as bloating constipation dropsy or swim bus orders aren't always caused by the same thing there are actually quite a few different reasons why fish can get these disorders so epsom salts isn't the one hundred percent miracle cure that you may be hoping for but what it can do is relieve some of the stress from the fish that's suffering from these problems and in that way it can help to get the fish back onto the right track and hopefully recover however in the case of constipation it is a very good cure for this problem so this is what magnesium sulfate looks like it's quite a large clear crystal quite a large and clear crystal so you can really differentiate it from table salt it is pretty obvious that it's a different thing also if you rub between your fingers it has an almost oily kind of texture it's not as sharp as table salt now the main problem with using extra sauce is the fact that no one has really quite decided the right dosage to give to fish now I've been through many many different forums and threads and some people say add X amount other people say add Y amount to your aquarium and no one creates like what the correct dosage is it's all kind of let's just take our best guess and that's kind of spread through the internet and now it's very confusing so I've gone through many different threads and I'm going to tell you the dosage that comes up the most frequently and the dosage which the most people can agree on to be the safest but yes it's an effective dose right so let's work out the dosage properly once and for all going off the most common dosages found on all of the different threads online now firstly let's establish what a gallon is now I would like to say that we're working off UK gallons but I'm not that naive and I'm assuming that pretty much all of the threads online are working off u.s. gallons okay so when I say per gallon I'm talking US gallons and all of the measurements online for some reason are all done in tablespoons and teaspoons no one's actually sat down to work it out in grams so let's work it out in grams as well now what I'm measuring I'm using teaspoons I'm not using something I found in my draw in my home to make tea with I'm using proper measuring spoons okay so the first most common dose that I found online is for when you're treating your entire tank so you might want to treat your entire tank when more than one fish is suffering from this ailment or you don't want to take your fish out of that aquarium and you don't want to stress it out more than it has to be so you just treat your tank passively and hopefully at a lower dose but for a longer period the fish will be helped by these Epsom salts so the most common dosage for this is 1/8 of a teaspoon per five gallons okay so 1/8 of a teaspoon per five gallons now let's work out firstly how much 1 teaspoon of epsom salts weighs now this is a flat or as flat as I can get teaspoon it's one teaspoon so one teaspoon of these epsom salts is about 5.2 grams it keeps varying I think the wind pressures the air pressure and here's a bit weird but it's about 5 grams that say now that's one teaspoon we wife of that so let's just divide it by 8 and we'll get 182 the TSP so that's point six five grams of epsom salts per five gallons u.s. for passive treatment of your fish now this can be left in your aquarium forever because it will come out when you do Wars changes it's something that your fish can live in quite happily at that dosage they'll get some mild treatment from the absent source and it won't do any harm if they're in it for a long period okay so the next dosage and the other way to treat epsom salts is via a short-term bath so basically what you do with this is you take your fish out put it into another container containing a solution of Epsom salts and aquarium water and you leave it in there for five to ten minutes and this is a highly concentrated bath of epsom salts and it gets right into the fish really quickly release the swelling quite strongly hopefully we'll get right into the fish and give it some relief quite quickly now being a stronger dose you don't leave it in the water for too long ten minutes really is the maximum some people say 15 but to be safe let's say ten minutes and then once it's had its bath you put it back into your aquarium making sure that the water temperature that you're putting it back into is as close to as where it came from so the most common dosage for the bath is in fact one tablespoon that's tablespoon per gallon so that is the most common dosage I found in all the forum's I've dredged through to get these dosages one tablespoon per US gallon now this measure is half a tablespoon so I'm going to do two of these level and we'll work out how much this weighs helps if the scales are on right that's half a tablespoon [Music] that's a tablespoon so it's seventeen point six grams my scales are acting up a little bit I mean let's call it seventeen and a half grams of epsom salts per gallon of water so we have it that is the dosages you want to use for your fish Epsom salt is a very safe thing to use for your aquarium fish as long as you don't overdose and as long live the fish in the bath for too long there's no reason why epsom salts should be toxic to your fish in any way we see you need to avoid that will avoid anything that's got any fragrances in it or any other chemicals in it you want a hundred percent or as close to a hundred percent epsom salts as possible and you do not want to confuse it with aquarium socks is a very different product but other than that I hopefully have answered one of the long-standing mysteries on the Internet fingers crossed that this treatment helps your fish out let me know in the comments if you've got any

riched with a derma protective agent rich developer powers the oxidation process moreover this rich developer contains cationic polymers such as I n ng packaged in a recyclable pouch the developer is very thick and rich simply press gently to dispense and Noah hair colors contain oxidative hair dyes for colouring MEA and alkaline and a thickener for optimal consistency and Noah hair colors are packaged in individual tubes of eight grams each and two tubes are required for one application six tubes or three applications are packaged in a box this smaller tube dosage makes it easier to mix

pattern test we're gonna see if there's really a difference between a three and a half and a three and if you really need to take that old mule kick drive some long beers so we're gonna be shooting at 20 40 and 60 I think the three is gonna hang in there until we get out to sixty yards I think the three is gonna be right there but this is always my round of choice so let's check her out let's get after it alright so today to test it we're going to use my old trusty Andrew my millisecond right here it's a Mossberg 8:35 turkey tactical with the cold black turkey in there best joke on the market so I'll see if there truly is a difference let's go here we go twenty yards three inch let's see good one on the Left everybody there's three now big boy shells three and a half 20 yards and I forgot to specify the left will be three inch the whole time the right will be three and a half so we don't separate anything so here's the three-and-a-half 20 yards [Music] still looks good alright so here we go thirty yards three inch long beard XR let's see what we got that was all me that was a flinch and a half but here we go three and a half stop I thought I pulled I think the red dot is still high and left I always have it cited a little high but you can tell they're still even so let's go out to 60 yards and see if there's a real difference between the three-inch and the three and a half and once again we're shooting long beard XR if you're not shooting that you're letting turkeys live let's go Oh 60 yards I think this is where the three and a half's gonna be noticeably different but here's the 3-inch left side 60 yards alright so that was the 3-inch at 60 yards from here from the I it looks like great pattern you guys saw it better but here's the three-and-a-half let's drop that hammer that's the three-and-a-half right there so Hawks behind the cam he's saying there's not really too much of a noticeable difference from the eye it looks about the same from here the 60 yards so naturally we got to go back further so let's go whoops you're doing a 80 all right market you go do that you get the camera ready I'm gonna get some ammo let's go long-range based off what I saw in the last one the three-inch looked better at 60 which kind of shocking to me but right now we're at 80 yards as you can tell when he zooms in we're gonna stick with the optical zoom to give you the best footage but it's not going to be as zoomed in on it because 80 yards is a poke would never shoot a turkey this far let's throw a code black turkey down three-inch 80 yards left target so here's the three-and-a-half eighty yards three and a half 80 yards [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that was a dead turkey bro huh that still has impact down there that looked like a dead bird all right so we got eighty yards three and a half looked like it was dead on the money but the pattern master looked like a dead bird we shot at 20 30 60 and then we decided to push it out to 80 just to see what had happened I would say we'll let you decide I would say the three-inch hangs tough of the three and a half so if you don't want that extra kick I think the three is still get er done once again this was with a Mossberg 835 turkey tactical with a cold black turkey choke tube so now I'm gonna grab the targets let's check them all this is the three and a half at 20 yards as you can tell pretty nice hole right there this is the three inch at 20 yards you know it's not too different I mean you have a tray gap right here there is more bb's in a three and a half so you're going to have that at 20 yards but the 3-inch is just as good I would say it would do the job so we got three and a half right here and then three-inch right here I shot high left on both of them but you can tell the pattern isn't much different so the three is still right there with it this is where I'm kind of confused the 60 yards for both of these didn't look too good this is the three and a half at sixty and then this is the three-inch at 60 and as you can tell the three-inch actually looks better at sixty three and a half at eighty three inch at 80 as you can tell the three and a half's got more pellets on the board but there's more pellets than a three and a half I felt like I missed and hold on this but I just I guess might have been just a pattern opening up that much the comparison between the three and a half and the three inch if you don't want the kick of a three and a half the three inch will be just as effective as a three and a half we've tested it we shot it we can tell by looking at the patterns is a three and a half more lethal I would say so you have more pellets you're hitting at a tight pattern just as the three-inch with more oomph behind it longer range if you have to shoot over I know you're three and a half's gonna have your back you know you're gonna hit with power but just a quick shout out for pattern master one good thing they do in their jokes is the shot string they reduce it so when you hit you hit hard and it will make a huge difference it's not only the tight pattern it's the shot string and the impact that you're gaining from how they design their chokes three to three-and-a-half personal preference if I shoot three and a half I like the kick I like putting them down three inch will still give you a good dirt nap I'm telling you right now

cake pan six by three because the internal dimensions is six inches by six and the height of this is three inches now this will fit perfectly in most large air fryers if you want to cook in your air fryer this is anodized aluminum so there's no coating on here that you have to worry about it peeling it's because it's nonstick just based on the nature of the anodization of the aluminum it's an ideal baking surface it's a safe seal anodized process it creates a stronger baking pan that's safe the word when things peeling off it's durable non-reactive finish will make a variety of recipes including citrus-based and savory recipes so you can make pizzas in here you can make cakes you can make pies just about anything that you want to bake in a square shape this will work perfectly now this is going to have even temperatures all across because this is a very thick aluminum i was very impressed with the quality of it it's very it's a commercial quality anodizing is not a coating it's an environmentally friendly process that contains no chemical additives dyes teflons pfoas pdfes nothing that can transfer peel flake or rust into your baking this is built bakery tough these are the same pans bakeries commercial kitchens and baking enthusiasts around the world depend on every day for professional results has a lifetime warranty and you can just hand wash this that's what's recommended so this is the premium signature series that we're talking about right here it was introduced in 2006 after the company wanted to produce a safer baking pan that didn't have any coatings on there but still had to release qualities this company's been around for 50 plus years so they've been designing manufacturing things they were founded in los angeles in 1968. it's family it's still family operated today pacific northwest come to continue to operate with the same family vision so i'm going to be demonstrating how to make a three layer this is a six inch square italian cream cake that has pecans and shredded coconut and the layers it'll be frosted with a cream cheese based frosting with more pecans and some toasted coconut on top so let's just look at this pan as you can see it is a perfect square and what's really important is i want to point out is i've looked at many pants before i arrived at this one and what do you notice right here this is really 90 degrees the majority of pans out there will have an angle and they will be tapered up like this and then you don't end up with a square edge and then when you go to frost it you have a slight triangle the only curve on here is a slight curve with a half inch by half inch pitch right there and that is absolutely minimal and that is down for thermal conductivity and strength of this pan it has a nice lip for rigidity and as i mentioned this is very very thick aluminum i actually have three of them i'll show you right here that's two three and i'm going to use all three of these three of these at the same time to bake that cake [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do so what's my overall opinion about the fat dadio's psq-663 anodized aluminum square cake pan six by three inches i think this is an excellent value you won't find any other pan that has this size with this true 90 degree edge right here and with this release quality of this anodized aluminum you have to worry about the coating

also being a linear programming problem by a graphical method and the case is Z maximized an equal to 15 X 1 plus 10 X 2 subject to the constraints for X 1 plus 6 X 2 less than or equal to 360 3 X 1 plus 0 X 2 less than or equal to 180 and 0 X 1 plus 5 X 2 equal less than or equal to 200 and X 1 and X 2 both are greater than or equal to 0 that means normally we do okay now what to draw a proper graph first we are going to segregate easily these inequalities into two parts equality as well as inequality because all the three how mix the signs less than or equal to less than or equal to less than or equal to inequality and equality first equality for X 1 plus 6 x 2 equals to 360 if it is 4 X 1 plus 6 X 2 equal to 360 then what can be the possible values of x and y respectively for relevant or rather x1 and x2 respectively for 11 values of x2 and x1 if in this equation x1 takes values u then what happens it becomes 6 x2 equals to 360 that means x2 will be 60 if x1 takes value 0 similarly if X 2 in this equation takes value 0 what is going to heaven for x1 equals to 3 sixty that means x1 equals to 90 so you can say that if it's two takes value 0 x1 will be 90 we have two points so we can easily draw a straight line for this equation so we are not going to take any more really now in equality but for x1 + 6 x2 less than 360 okay now I mean if x1 takes value 0 what is going to happen 6 x2 less than 360 that means X 2 will be less than 60 and if X 2 takes value 0 it will be for X 1 less than 360 that means x1 less than 90 now in this case first equality 3 x1 equals to 180 that means x1 equals to 60 the meaning of this is for any value of x 2 x 1 remains constant at 60 X 2 takes anywhere you then x1 is or x1 remains 60 okay now what it is not necessary to prepare this kind of books in case there is only one equation in the constraint only one variable in the constraint I'm very sorry but let's simplify this x1 x2 for whatever value of x2 X 1 will remain 60 now inequality part 3 X 1 less than 180 so x1 less than 60 in this case also tax first a equality a 5 X 2 equals to 200 that means X 2 equals to 40 so for whatever value of x 1 x 2 is going to remain constant 40 the important thing is to learn how to draw the straight line of this kind of constraint where there is only one variable okay even any part file x2 less than 200 so it's 2 less than 40 so now we have all these things and now let's draw a diagram on the graph paper so please take a graph paper and since all the numbers are in multiple of 10 we are going to take scale of 10 on X X's it will be 1 centimeter equals to either 5 or 10 if you want to draw a graph of say larger size you can read 1 centimeter equals to 5 points on both the exits over you can take 1 centimeter equals to 10 in this in that case the graph the image of the graph will be quite smaller okay just to have the sufficient space to draw a sketch of graph I am going to draw only a sketch of graph because on this board I cannot draw a graph with exact measurements and is it scaling so I am just going to draw a sketch of graph but on the basis of there you will be able to everything I'm just going to repeat this one and here we are both harm or negative this is x2 axis as well as this is X 1 axis on X 1 the lowest value is 10 and highest value is 19 so we need either 9 centimeters or 18 centimeters now what scale you are going to take is upon you but please use graph paper you please don't draw this end of scales every time whenever you go for practice of graphical method use graphs on X 2x is the lowest value is 10 and the highest value is 60 now this one in this case x1 is 90 when x2 takes value 0 and x2 is 60 men x1 takes values you it's 260 and x10 on this word evil X is X 2 X 1 is always 0 on this axis and on this X is X 1 X 2 you always you so whenever it is x1 equals to 0 that means this length x 1 0 and X 2 16 it is here at this point X 1 is 0 and X 2 is 60 similarly X 2 is 0 and X 1 is 90 on this X 1 axis and every point X 2 is 0 so X 2 is 0 and X 1 is 90 that can be here okay now we have two points for Iman's lying on same straight line and to draw a line two boys are sufficient you just need one another we just need to draw a line passing through both of these points on this kind of board it is not possible for me to draw a straight line and I am going to draw a sketch you are well aware but you please use the full length ruler of 12 inches at least to draw the line and be as much accurate as possible this is just a sketch so this is the line of the equation for x 1 + 6 X 2 equal to 360 now what about this inequality but the first is X 2 less than 60 where is X 2 equal to 60 year and where are the values of these two less than 60 this side so draw a small arrow indicating that side that means it's 2 takes when you sixty or less but because of the non-negativity constraint X 2 is not going to date any value less than 0 0 so we are not going to draw the remaining part of the graph paper now similarly X 1 less than 90 it's only written 90 here and less than 90 means all these values and because of non negativity constraint X 1 is not going to take any value less than 0 90 or less this is the importance of segregating the inequality two to do bars equality as well as inequality so then we can correctly determine the side of the inequality whether it is going on graph paper below the line or above the line 60 or less 90 or less is it okay now in this case for any value of x2 x1 is going to take value 60 that means X 1 remains 60 for any possible value of x2 it's 160 cm now what we are only one point and to draw a line we must have it stupids x2 10 and 60 you can think in this way although an X - 60 results of 60 almost year you can determine this point accurately on graph paper but the other thing is if the equation has only one variable then take its value on the axis of their variable and draw a line passing from that point parallel to the other variable here it is x1 equals to 60 X 160 the line will pass from x1 equals to 60 parallel to X 2 if you understand this thing you need to prepare this kind of box and assume this kind of values of another medieval approx it will be of this color this is the line of x1 equals to 60 okay now what x1 equals to 60 okay what about inequality by X 1 less than 60 X 1 less than 60 yes less than 60 means either 50 40 30 20 10 or set to zero but it cannot go rather they value less than zero because of non negativity constant similarly in this case X 2 is 40 okay X 2 is 14 no is 1 so the line will go parallel to X 1 X 2 is equal to 40 and again the inequalities X 2 less than 40 less than 40 yes for me 40 or less okay now we know that this is X 2 equal to 0 and X well X money question so and so so this is X 2 0 or more this is X 1 0 or more because X 1 is 0 on this line and greater value on this side ok this is X 160 or less 60 means line and less means inner side you need not to draw the Senate region outside the common region but to understand the common region accurately I am drawing this kind of like yes okay now this is 60 or less ninety or less so these line is going to rather this inequality is going to below the line we are interested in the common region of all the constraints and this is the common digital shared it properly and more precisely actually we are interested in the corner points vertices of the common region yes what I see four corner points which are the corner points one two three four and five okay this is say o 0 0 X 1 and X 2 both take value 0 here and say this is a and and X 1 is 0 X 2 is 40 this is B and V X 1 is 30 and X 2 is 40 if you have drawn your graph properly it will exactly for 30 and 40 this is the another point of common region feasible region convex polygon of region C and all that Point C the coordinates are 16 and 20 X 1 is 60 X 2 is 20 and this is the last set D and the X 2 is 0 and X 1 is 60 this are the 5 vertices all corner points of the feasible region according to the fundamental law a fundamental principle of linear programming the optimal solution of a linear programming lies at any one or more of the vertices or corner points of the feasible region where feasible region means common region of all constraints that is determined on the basis of the lines as well as shaded region of all the constraints line indicates or represents the Equality part of the constraint and the shaded region represent the inequality part of the constraint and the common region is shown by the shade see all these sharing have no importance only this part so you can show the shading on this part only in the feasible region only now how to determine at which particular corner point the optimal solution is lying for that purpose we have to substitute the values of x 1 as well as - and the coordinates of all the corner points what is the objective function 15 X 1 + 10 H - and what is not that you maximization let's step we haven't you checked it by writing only so we are going to write that part yes former point or vertex coordinates at the vertex Z equals 215 X 1 plus 10 X 200 both are 0 and 0 so the objective function is going to take value 0 okay let's take me the last venture into consideration it will be 15 to 0 plus 10 equals 0 so 0 plus 0 0 in a the coordinates are 0 and 40 so it will be 15 into 0 plus 10 into 40 so 0 plus 400 equals to 400 and B they are 30 and 40 it will be 15 into 30 plus 10 into 40 ok 15 into 3450 plus 10 into 4,400 so total me you 850 and C there are 60 and 20 15 into 60 plus 10 into 20 15 into 16 is 900 plus 10 into 20 mins 200 it takes value here 100 or 1100 and the last corner point or vertex is d that is 60 and 0 15 into 60 plus 10 into 0 so it will be 900 plus equals to 900 what is the objective the objective is to maximize the value of the function and the objective function takes its maximum possible value and vertex for corner point see where X 1 is 16 and X 2 is 20 so the optimal solution of this LP be X 160 X 220 and maximum Z because now objective is maximization 1100 yes now I suggest you people to solve this problem by simplex method we have already a separate playlist on simplex method as well as Big M method and since this case has all the less than or equal to all the constraints with less than or equal to sign we can solve these by simplex method so I suggest you to solve this particular problem by simplex method and observe what exactly happens you will find at the end of each and every simplex table",

UK and there's a couple of examples and also a quick test that you can download and have a go at some of the questions for yourself and all raise your questions generally tend to be round about C grade at GCSE they're relatively straightforward because all we need to do really is find out the value of one part which I think I mentioned in the previous video and then use that value in order to calculate the answer to the question so this particular question and I will put into the description box below and also if you visit maths rap it'll be on there as well ok so this particular question deals with making a pizza and this particular person is going to make pizza in the ratio of 2 3 to 5 I'll just refer to my notes here so it's 2 lots of cheese 3 lots of topping and 5 lots of dough ok and with this particular pizza this person has used 70 grams of dough ok and what they want us to find out is how many grams of topping will this person use as persons called Jared I believe ok so i'm 5-8 if it's the ratio to 3 to 5 what I mentioned is is that in the last videos that you need to find the value of one part well the information we've got is that they use 70 grams of dough well if the ratio is 5 parts of dough then really to find the value of one part then all we need to do is divide 70 grams I five well if you divide 70 grams by five that will give us the value of one part so value of one part equals seventy divided by five or if you prefer seventy divided by five well that's going to give the value of one part as 14 so in other words each of these parts here would be 14 grams it happens these five parts of them so in other words 70 grams of dough well now we've got the value of that it will allow us then to work out the value of the topping and also if we want the value of the cheese so let's just put that up on the board we're sharing in the ratio to three to five we know this is 70 grams and we also know that each part is 14 grams so for the topping it will be three times forty or three times fourteen I'm going to work that out on the side here is two ones carrying 42 so that's going to be 42 grams and two grams of topping is two grams of cheese is going to be 28 grams okay so really as I mentioned in the previous video providing you work out the value of one part then it should be fairly straightforward in order to answer a question like this now this particular question they've asked how many grams of topping what the answer is going to be 42 so to answer the first the question you need to write 42 the grounds of topping okay and I hope that's okay for you please do add a comment below have a look at the master up channel math website and the YouTube channel please do post PM tweets and I look forward to seeing you next time", "ebDPivG16HE": "Kitten season is here It's the time of year where kittens are entering shelters in huge numbers Often times without a mother. Most of the time this is because well-meaning people find kittens outside and assume that they've been abandoned When really the mother is usually right down the block. So if you find a kitten outside And they don't appear to be in immediate danger Please wait at least two to three hours to see if the mother does return Nobody's better at taking care of a little kitten than their own mama, but if you found your kitten And you're sure that she's an orphan, she's going to need special care and that includes bottle feeding. Whether you found kitten outside, or signed up to foster for your local shelter, here are my top tips for safely bottle-feeding kittens. Are you hungry? Tip number one; \"Get the right supplies\" Motherless neonatal kittens have sensitive systems that require a special kitten formula Not just any dairy product you have in the fridge. It's extremely dangerous to feed a kitten the wrong thing So please NEVER feed a kitten something she won't be able to digest Never feed a kitten cow's milk, condensed milk, soy milk, or other dairy alternatives Human Baby Formula or even cat milk Cat milk is a product that's sold at stores as a supplemental treat for adult cats But it's not kitten formula Instead you want to pick up something that says kitten formula such as one of these products Kitten formula is specially formulated to provide a proper balance of vitamins, minerals, Probiotics and a caloric pattern that mimics the content of a mother cats milk. I have links to some of the products that I like at kittenlady.org/supplies While picking up your kitten formula you'll also want to pick up a kitten bottle and perhaps an extra set of nipples Most nipples will not come pre-cut, meaning you'll have to cut a hole in them yourself There are a lot of different ways that people do this, including cutting an X or cutting a V into the nipple. My preferred method is to cut the nipple on an angle so that just a small hole is visible Cutting a hole properly it's important because it will determine the flow of the formula while the kitten is nursing To ensure proper flow, test the hole by turning the bottle upside down The formula should slowly drip out, one drop at a time if the hole is the correct size If you turn it upside down and nothing flows out You need to enlarge the hole. If you turn it upside down, and it flows too quickly Then you'll have to try again with a new nipple. Because there's so much room for human error with traditional nipples I like to recommend a product called a \"miracle nipple\" A miracle nipple is a specialty product you can buy online It's a hard rubber nipple with a hole already cut into it, and it can attach to a syringe for smaller kittens Or get popped onto a bottle lid, like this These are great because the hole is already cut, so it offers a steady flow and they come in a few different sizes for different ages of kittens. I have links to these on my website at kittenlady.org/supplies Ok, so once you have your supplies, it's time for tip number 2 \"Preparing the bottle properly\" In order to prepare the bottle properly you want to make sure that you're making your formula fresh, clump free and comfortably warm You want to make your formula fresh every one to two feedings, to ensure that the formula is safe for consumption So don't make a big jug of it to serve throughout the day. Follow the preparation instructions for the formula you purchase and make sure that any powder you don't use get sealed and put in the refrigerator right away If you're using a powdered formula, mix the powder thoroughly with more water according to the instructions Until it's completely smooth You might benefit from using a product like a smoothie shaker which will break up the formula's clumps it's important that the formula is clump free, because a clump can clog the bottle and result in a lot of frustration for both you and the kitten Finally make sure that your formula is the right temperature. You can mix your powder formula with warm water But if you're using an already mixed formula that you've saved in the fridge You're going to want to get it to the right temperature before you feed Some people do this with a quick 8 seconds zap at the microwave And other people use a teakettle method You can pour boiling water into a mug Place the bottle in the mug and let it float for about 20 seconds Shake up the bottle thoroughly and test it on the inside of your wrist to ensure that it's comfortably warm Remember that if the temperature is too hot or too cold for your skin It's definitely not the right temperature for a tiny kitten Once you've got your bottle ready It's time for tip number three \"Properly feeding your kitten.\" Before you reach for a bottle make sure that it's safe to feed the kitten Because kittens cannot self regulate their body temperature Hypothermia may occur in kittens who are orphaned if the kitten feels cold to the touch or has a temperature of 95 degrees or less It's not safe to feed her, focus on gradually increasing her temperature before attempting to feed Once the kitten is the appropriate temperature, it's time to bottle feeding When you're getting ready to feed a kitten, find a comfortable place to put her in your lap or on a table Always feed the kitten in a natural belly down posture The kitten should be comfortably lying or seated with her belly towards the floor May have seen images in the past of kittens eating on their back like a human baby, but this is very wrong and very dangerous Feeding a kitten on her back will be like hanging a human from her feet and feeding her a burger It just doesn't make any sense. Feeding a kitten on  her back can cause aspiration Which is where a kitten inhale fluid into the lungs. This is so dangerous, so please Never ever feed a kitten on her back. Think of how a kitten would feed from her mother on her belly Laying down or sitting next to the mama. Sit the kitten in your lap or on a table Holding the head steady with your non-dominant hand and introduce the nipple to her mouth with your dominant hand Don't be scared to really hold the kittens head, this is how you're going to help direct her towards the food Invert the bottle so that the formula can slowly flow into the kittens mouth but never forcefully squeeze the bottle into her mouth Instead you want her to suckle at her own pace Ideally the kitten will latch. Latching is when a kitten makes a U shape with her tongue and suckles to drink the formula You'll know she's latched when she looks like she's very engaged and active maybe even with telltale ear wiggle Place a finger on her throat to ensure that she's swallowing and she eats You'll be able to feel each gulp which will let you know that she's eating properly. Here's what a good latch looks like So hopefully that's what you're going to get But just in case here's tip number four; \n\"How to feed fussy kittens\" Getting that perfect latch feels great, but it doesn't always happen here's a tip for what to do If you have a fussy kitten that just doesn't want to cooperate If the kitten doesn't latch, don't panic Eating out of the side of the mouth is something that some kids may do at first And that's okay as long as she is definitely swallowing and as long as she doesn't have her premolars or molars yet Kittens who are five weeks or older will have teeth on the side of their mouth that can easily shred a nipple and they could swallow it and cause a blockage But younger kittens don't have teeth on the side of their mouth yet So if they do chew on a nipple on the side of their mouth It's okay as long as your finger is on their throat and you can feel that they are swallowing if the kitten is fussy and doesn't seem interested in eating Stop what you're doing and try to figure out what the problem is Sometimes it's just the posture, or the flow of the formula So make sure that you're feeding in a comfortable position, and that there is something wrong with the bottle Is it too hot? Is it too cold? Is the hole in the nipple big enough? Is there a clump blocking the formula for coming out? All of these things can cause a kitten to just not really know what to do So make sure that everything is working properly. If the kitten is squirmy or disinterested, remember this okay to really handle them Some people are scared to handle a kitten because of how fragile they are But you have to remember that the kitten doesn't know what you're trying to do You have to show them So hold the head and body stable with one hand You can even wrap them in a blanket if need be, using the barbershop technique Like this This can help the kitten stay focused and protect your hands from tiny claws at the same time You can also help the kitten feel ready to bottle feed by brushing her with a toothbrush or by cradling her face in your hand This simulates the experience of being nozzled against the mama's fuzzy belly and being groomed, which can help encourage them to eat Most importantly remember to be really patient with your kitten. If they're being really fussy, just remember to take it slow and help solve the problem It's so important that you get some food in these little guys every couple hours And you're the only hope they have, so try to be patient with them Okay, so tip number five; \"Feed the right amount and the right frequency.\" Young kittens require frequent feedings, so be prepared and care for them around the clock until they're about five or six weeks of age and weaning onto wet food For the first few weeks of life That will mean waking up in the middle of the night to feed Try not to be intimidated by having to wake up in the middle of the night Even though the care is frequent it only takes a few minutes of your time And it makes a huge difference for the little guys. Having small amounts of food every few hours is going to help keep them hydrated and keep them balanced with nutrients and fat that they need for rapid development and weight gaining You'll see that as the kittens get older, the amount they eat will increase but the frequency of feeding will decrease That means that the older the kittens are, the longer of a break you'll get between feeding. You can use this feeding chart to determine how much your kittens should be eating and how often Just remember that each kitten is different, so this is just a guideline, not a rule book. Some kittens vary in weight and development So use your best judgment while keeping this guide in mind as a helpful baseline. Tip number six; \"Monitor the kittens progress.\" Make sure that you have a small digital scale on hand and weigh them daily So that you can monitor how they're doing Having their weight will help you determine their stomach capacity and how often they should be eating But it will also help alert you if something's going wrong Keeping track of the kittens weight is a great way to ensure that the kitten is making the necessary gains Weight the kitten at least once a day and write down her weight in grams She should be gaining at least 10 grams per day. If the kitten is not gaining weight or if she loses weight Seek immediate veterinary support My last tip is to remember that it doesn't stop a bottle feeding You will also be tasked with stimulating the kitten to go to the bathroom Atending to her medical needs, keeping her warm and clean And otherwise providing her with a safe and secure environment until she's old enough for adoption After feeding, wipe down the kittens face so that no formula is sticking to her fur Gently rub the kittens genitals with a soft tissue to stimulate her to urinate and defecate Do this at each feeding being mindful to wipe up afterwards so that she stays clean and comfortable Once the kitten has been fed, stimulated and cleaned up It's time for her to go back to her warm safe space until the next feeding Repeat until the kitten is weaning onto wet kitten food Good luck with your bottle feeding and thank you for helping to fight for the little guys", "m1f3ZZ3qVno": "I got that [ __ ] bag on you the animal story got the [ __ ] bag all right guys how about a smoke on this grape Topanga that I bought from PCF today and I just had to do a video so this eighth costed me $15 it's a 22 point 27 percent THC with no CBD this strain name is Beautif Anja I believe grape Topanga is great pie with Topanga oh gee from what I read online it's a jungle boy screen originally so I'm not too sure about that but that's when I read online and yesterday I got the idea to do a video where I compare a $30 eighth versus a $15.00 eighth in California so this year is a $30 eighth I mean this here is a $15 I'm sorry not $30 there's a $50 out the door Oh tax 20 let's say 20 22 percent THC into the indica dominant hybrid from this smell and the looks of the stems it looks like it's indoor so that's pretty [ __ ] crazy the smell getting off of this is very very very great was like a hint of just the hitting of gas it's like a grape gassy some though and this was really really really good this is the PCF brand from the dispensary that I go to patient care first under the label right here versus hybrid or I'm it right here where it says the lab it says earth labs so I believe Earth Labs is like the one who grew the strain and PCA of just bought pounds of it you know and they sell it so this is a fifteen dollar 8 I just want to show you guys real quick before I smoke it and for the taste I'll update you guys after the video or when I'm showing you guys the $30.00 eighth and yeah just want to show you guys real quick it'll probably be a quick video click fives eight minute video but yeah so far I'll show you guys how this breaks up real quick too so it is soft it's not crunchy at odds breaks off to the touch honestly this is really really good for $15 I haven't gotten eighth like this for that price and I'm innocent from the dispensary but yeah guys let's see that's a great Topanga GCF $15 off the door 22 percent THC and yeah I'm awesome ok Nick Swisher I [ __ ] seen somebody smoking a Swisher today and I I just [ __ ] that tastes just got to me so I was craving one having smoked in the minute but uh yeah that's it guys peace so being pretty quiet here and I know I want to compare like a war the $50 eighth versus a $30.00 hate how it looks like we're from and this is how it looks like where I'm from so the first the first part of the video was the fitting lightly and now this is a Korova it was actually under $30 this is all I have left is what 8 but honestly house there's way bigger than I than this but also there's one bigger like huge leg and the rest of the Nerds were like either this eyes are a little bit bigger so so and that but then actually it kind of did because it was a little bit more per my bag so this other $30 a faux fur over but you know $30 ate look different all the time if you guys look back at that Koroma video I did of the sunday driver that was the crazy looking 8th you know and I got the for the same price $27 so you know this is just one example but this is very very very very very very soft and soft it looks like you just break it down very very no and the smells crazy like it's always well girl Korova I bought it a couple times already and it hasn't been one time where like it's I've had a bad batch you know here's a close-up of the information you guys weren't able to see yeah I'm not sure what this means yes I know what this means put in the comments have been pretty curious about that and this is a part I was talking about that they should take off it should only keep this sticker and this and they should take off this pickleball keep that but they should take off this little K right here with the Korova and then they probably had to keep that warning counter there but this sticker design y'all look at me though give us a better look at the but I mean it's not like I should be ashamed of the person Crazy Love that's pretty crazy because uh that's pretty crazy it's pretty [ __ ] crazy go no but it's while doctors like this isn't too different for that it's until the 8th that I had I mean like if you're very picky I mean yeah this is softer to the touch the taste is gonna be you know maybe if you're very picky the order slightly different noticeably different if you're a tricky but and also like look I know that I got this you know so there's like things like that I spot a little bit more actually literally all the stem that's all the stuff I got a lotta from that whole [ __ ] life no look look you guys used to [Music] guys so my [ __ ] phone cut off because they got to 15% in the flash cut off [ __ ] night so can't see nothing but uh I was about to end the video anyways but what I was saying is like yeah you know there's there's literally no stem the whole night there's no stem so there so there's going to be those noticeable differences you know like you know just high-end [ __ ] like if you know you're buying Express you're buying loot Louie Gucci Prada why sell you know those kinda just like that it's you know the same but at the end of the days you know the same t-shirt but there's just that little bit of quality that makes a difference you know so that's really what it is you know that's my opinion in my opinion I go [Music] sometimes I buy $30 $40 days and you know sometimes about a $50 8 and I'll stock up for a week or two and I'll save some money you know it just really depends how you doing but yeah I was gonna be here guys stay late and make sure to subscribe share videos follow me on my snapchat my Instagram I'm talking down low go on my website buy a shirt and yeah v8 guys later [Music] [Music]", "rncrV30V5Ao": "we're going to show you how you can cook it to perfection in all-clad this is our all-clad triply stainless steel eight inch and 12 inch frypan set we've got this for you at a special holiday surprise sale price tonight and as we flip these pork chops Ric Roman David take a look at this so eautiful I mean when you're using all cut it's triply what does that mean it's bonded aluminum with stainless steel and why is that important David but we patented this process when we created all clad for professional chefs and packed passion and home cooks and what does that do it gives you even heating that's from the edge of the pan down the side all the way across so you get an incredible searing that carmelization that development of flavors mhm but it also because it's stainless steel the David you develop that fond on the bottom of the pan if you look here in the pan you can see there's a little bit of flavor because it grabs the food David wild searing and then when it's done searing it releases and what I love about working with stainless steel notice how I'm going in with the metal utensils right I don't have to worry about it so now when you go to deglaze the pan add a little bit of wine you can do everything in the pan you can sear on the stovetop I'm putting a little bit of red wine we're making a beautiful fall this year we're gonna add in some beautiful apples that are marinated in a little bit of cider and I love it because David you know you think about the chefs and those professional kitchens and how they're cooking they're using all had because it's so durable the stainless steel will stand up to the rigors of the kitchen right it also performs that aluminum core retains the heat gives you that wonderful even cooking here we have some leeks and then some beautiful cranberries and guess what after you've finished what you're doing on the stovetop you can go right to the oven yeah I love it hey I'll tell you also this factory is located in Canonsburg Pennsylvania names Berg Pennsylvania that's right David and you know look we've got a little videotape you can talk to us about it Dave you know what I love I saw them from every step of the way from the selection of the best stainless steel in aluminum then they actually form each piece and you know what it goes through over 30 different people's hands in the process so they're inspecting it polishing so they're making sure when you receive that all clad box you're getting something that's worthy of bearing that all clad name and you know what David I get to work with these pans I had a restaurant for over 20 years of caring business and the way they work in the kitchen is just amazing and you know what I love about it they come with a lifetime warranty these are pans that you just can't hurt well and what's also great about this set tonight we've got it on a holiday surprise price which is actually thirty percent off the normal chemo Wow we've got this at one forty nine ninety six and what are you getting you're getting an 8 to 12 inch ball clad triply stainless steel skillet it's a layer of stainless steel a layer of aluminum and a layer of stainless steel all bonded together you're also going to love that we've got it on six easy payments and free shipping and handling but I should tell you that if you went to all clad Comm to buy this same pair of skillets you would pay two hundred forty-five dollars we have it at almost a hundred dollars less about 95 dollars less so you're looking at that six easy payments free shipping and handling and you're looking at flat cookware that goes into your dishwasher goes into your oven works on any stovetop including induction moving induction it calls the stainless steel is magnetized that's right now check this out we did this this is what I love it we sear these pork chop so we got all that great flavor you saw we started then we finished it in the oven with the apples with the leeks smells like Thanksgiving it I mean look at this it's beautiful so you went from start to finish stovetop to the oven but here's the other thing David that little that the 8 inch pan I love it cuz check it out we use it I use it to roast nuts I used it to saute mushrooms little side dishes now we've got these gorgeous gorgeous roasted nuts you can garnish it so you can do everything from start to finish and again that stainless steel David it's so important for me because it's nonreactive what does that mean all your flavors and recipes have that purity there's nothing you have to worry about there's no coatings and again big heat up and I talked about even heating this is a great example okay take a look at this we're doing a little bit of a scampi okay take a look at this weather it's from the edge of the pan down the side or across you get great even heating but you also get great heat response what does that mean when you drop a piece of meat in there you put your shrimp in there to saute it recovers the heat so quickly because it pushes it up to that stainless steel lay exactly right and this is what the chefs are choosing this is what home cooks are loving you get your cooked pasta in there and make delicious treat that is so so perfect for your family and friends holiday season is coming

to try some all-clad but maybe not the whole set to begin that's right okay try the skillets tonight maybe this is just the ticket with six easy payments of $24.99 and free shipping and handling you finally have the price that you feel comfortable budgeting and I totally get it this is investment cookware and maybe you're not ready to invest in the big 13 piece set which will offer closer to Christmas but this is your opportunity to maybe try the skillets first to see what all the excitement's about it is in this is a great example of one pot or one pan dishing we took the 12 inch we sear it off eight chicken thighs okay so what we do is first we sauteed that bacon we've rendered that fat then we caramelized those chicken thighs again that even he didn't give us a great browning that layer of flavor then we put in our kale and our sweet potatoes to soak up that goodness big went from the stovetop to the oven all in one 12-inch dish to think that that's eight servings in this one pan huge I mean this is cooking for a crowd it is I mean and you know what the results you get and I think about it people when they go out to eat and those professional chefs they're saying how do they get all that great flavor it's because when you're searing caramelizing using that stainless steel develop that fond that you just don't get in other other cooking vessel that's what the valves as layers of flavor and that's what the triply bonded cook let's remind you there's a 12 inch skillet and eight inch skillet and you're getting it all for 149 and change this same offer at all clad

one liter is actually equal to 1000 cc we also say this is equal to 1,000 CC means centimeter cube so I hope you remember this 1 liter is 1000 centimeter cube now we need to convert this to meter cube one centimeter is equal to 1 over 100 meter well you know that 1 meter equals to 100 centimeter correct so if I have to get what is 1 centimeter equals 2 then basically I need to divide both sides by 100 credit so if I do that I get that 1 over 100 meters is equal to 1 centimeter that were justice so what I will do here is a replace centimeter by 1 over 100 meter so we'll get our conversions we have thousand times instead of seven centimeters I'll write 1 over 100 meters and cube correct so instead of centimeter I wrote the conversion factor one over hundred so that gives us one thousand times so when we Q we have to multiply by 100 times hundred times hundred so what we get here is six zeros right and the unit's will be now meter cube now it is simpler you could cancel three zeros and you're left with three so what you get here is one over thousand I mean meter cube great so if I divide one by thousand then get 0.01 meter cube so in a way one liter is equal to one over thousand meter cube which is equal to 0.01 so when you divide by thousand decimal moves right one two and three so it is actually 0.01 two zeros will be there I'm sorry for that so if you divide by ten you get one then hundred and ten thousand perfect or you could also write that one thousand liters is equal to one meter cube so anyway so that is how they are related so that is the way you could relate one thousand liters is meter cube or one liter is equal to one over thousand meter cube or 0.001 meter cube so I hope that helps you to understand the relation between liters and meter cube feel free to

bucket. Only using these buckets, and\nan unlimited amount of water, obtain exactly four gallons of\nwater in two of the buckets. So, I hope you have already\nattempted this problem. If you haven't, I hope\nyou'll pause the video and give it a try. In our solution, we actually\nwon't waste any water. We use exactly eight gallons of water to obtain four gallons of\nwater in two of the buckets. And we use this table here\nto keep track of our steps where each column represents\nthe amount of water in the eight gallon, five\ngallon, and three gallon buckets. For the first step we'll fill up the eight gallon bucket\nwith eight gallons of water. So we'd have eight gallons\nhere, zero gallons here, and zero gallons here. Step two, we're going to\nuse these eight gallons in the eight gallon bucket to fill up the five gallon bucket. So in the next step we'd have five gallons in the five gallon bucket. Which would leave us with three gallons in the eight gallon bucket. And we still have zero gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. Next we're going to use the five gallons in the five gallon bucket to fill up the three gallon bucket.\nAnd when we do this we'd have three gallons in\nthe three gallon bucket, which would leave two gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, and we still have three gallons\nin the eight gallon bucket. In our next step, we're going\nto take the three gallons in the three gallon\nbucket, and pour them into the eight gallon bucket that currently has three gallons of water. That would give us six gallons\nin the eight gallon bucket, we still have two gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, and now we'd have zero gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. Next, we're going to pour the two gallons in the five gallon bucket\ninto the three gallon bucket. So we'd have two gallons\nin the three gallon bucket, zero gallons in the five gallon bucket, and we still have six gallons\nin the eight gallon bucket. Next, we'll fill up the five gallon bucket using the six gallons\nthe eight gallon bucket. That would give us five gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, one gallon left in the\neight gallon bucket, and we still have two gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. Next, we'll use the five gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, to fill up the three gallon bucket, which currently have two gallons in it. So we'd pour one of these five gallons into the three gallon\nbucket, that would give us three gallons in the three gallon bucket, four gallons in the five gallon bucket, and we still have 1 gallon\nin the eight gallon bucket. And for our last step, we\nwill pour the three gallons in the three gallon bucket\ninto the eight gallon bucket which currently has one gallon. When we do this, we\nwould have four gallons in the eight gallon bucket. We still have four gallons\nin the five gallon bucket, and now we have zero gallons\nin the three gallon bucket. And we've completed our\ntask, we now have exactly four gallons of water\nin two of the buckets. We have four gallons in\nthe eight gallon bucket and four gallons in\nthe five gallon bucket.

comm where you can browse over 450 complete math lessons with example videos interactive practice problems self tests and more try a complete lesson today at your teacher comm Martin has a total of 19 nickels and dimes worth a dollar sixty-five how many of each type of coin does he have let's start this problem by setting up a chart down the left side we'll have our different types of coins in this case nickels and dimes across the top we'll have our formula which we talked about in the previous example number of coins times the value of each coin equals their total value now let's fill out our chart for a number of nickels and dimes we know that Martin has a total of 19 nickels and dimes but we don't know how many of each he has in fact that's what the problems asking so if we represent our number of nickels as X we can call our number of Dimes 19 minus X the value of each nickel is 5 cents the value of each dime is 10 cents our total value based on our formula is going to come from the first column times the second column so the total value of our nickels is x times 5 or 5x and the total value of our dimes is 19 minus x times 10 or 10 parentheses 19 minus X our goal in this problem will be to find X because X represents our number of nickels and the problem asks how many of each type of coin does he have if we know the number of nickels we can easily find the number of dimes and we'll have our answer but we need an equation in order to find X and it's important to understand that the information in this equation will always come from the last column of your chart the total value column so what do we know about the total value of our nickels and the total value of our dimes well we know that the total value of all of our coins is a dollar 65 so if we add the total value of our nickels plus the total value of our dimes that should equal a dollar 65 so down here we're going to add another box and inside we're going to put a hundred and sixty-five notice I wrote a dollar 65 in terms of sense because our value of nickles and value of Dimes is also written in terms of cents and we need to be consistent so here's our equation 5x plus 10 times 19 minus x equals 165 if we solve this we get x equals 5 going back up into our chart remember that X represents our number of nickels so Martin has five nickels to get his number of dimes we take 19 minus X which is 19 minus 5 or 14 dimes and that's our answer", "X-c6Pc4_il0": "table of 16 16 ones of 16 16 months a 16 16 juice' 32 16 to the 32 16 phrase of 48 16 Fraser 48 16 pose a 64 16 poles of 64 16 580 16 580 16

I'll tell you we have no reorder on this to a set of two we will not be able to get this set of two skillets back in stock what we have today is all we have and if you've been wanting to try all clad now's the time today is your day this is your moment these are amazing when I heat it up those sausages yesterday those beautiful big pork sausages I did it in my other plan on top of the stove that's Rome and welcome back to you hello chef Burke Roman is here former restaurant owner caterer busy husband and father does a lot of cooking and his family's right tell us about all planet why we should be excited about they started 46 years ago this is stainless steel but it's not just stainless steel it's a special patented bonding process that we came up with combining both aluminum and stainless steel in fact I had a chance to visit the factory to see the construction firsthand and there it is it starts with hand layered stainless steel aluminum and then another layer of stainless steel it goes through that roll bonded process that first involves some heating and a super super high power press but then each individual piece is formed from there it goes through about three dozen looks like 36 different people's hands from the polishing of the interior that starburst stainless steel that gives you incredible searing but also that stick resisting property that releases your food all the way down to those stainless steel handles that are riveted on it when you get all cut you're getting pieces that are guaranteed are going to last a lifetime in fact these are the pieces you're going to hand down to other people and but what I love about it this is the cookware the chefs are using this isn't a different version I love this cookware I use it all the time in my kitchen and when we talk about that role bonding process and even heat distribution I'm talking from the edge of the pan down the side all the way across there's no hot spots and if you're worried about cooking in stainless steel David what I love about stainless steel is it gives you great searing but when the food is ready to be turned it actually releases from the pan so here's a delicate thing like salmon take a look at this it comes right up off the pan but you get that perfect browning and sear every time this is the flavor this is how you develop all that complexity and richness in your dishes and this is why those restaurants and those chefs love it because there is that browning there's that flavor in the bottom of the pan it grabs some of the flavor of the meat so now when you go in there with something like white wine or stock you can actually pull all that flavor off of the bottom of the pan here I have a little bit of white wine and I what I love about this 12-inch side I have six pieces of salmon in here I know the major so I'm putting a little lemon and white wine any really simple ingredients then I want to put in just a touch of butter okay we're gonna let that cook down for just a minute and in a matter of minutes we would just take a moment to get now oh yeah smell it oh it's amazing and this is a kind of cooking you can do and look at the even heat distribution I need to let you know we're already very busy in fact already over 200 are gone I also want to remind you that this is a 12 and an 8 inch skillet Rick we're not getting a reorder on this what I have in stock today is all we have we were able to arrive at a price that is extraordinary it is 45% less than the regular QVC price were nearly half priced today almost half price today that were within 5% of being absolutely at retail these two pans would sell for 245 we're it were a hundred and twenty seven dollars and three pennies less that's crazy this is an extraordinary buy this is all clad this company located in Canonsburg Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh's Wright great opportunity for you to pick this up try all clad for the first time we've got free shipping and handling we've got six easy payments and we have fewer than 2,200 to go around these are going very quickly and everybody's saying you know what I've seen that all clap before maybe the bigger sets I can't maybe do right now because that's not in my budget but I can do two pans I'm going to do two pans for 117 you put them on six pay and free shipping how much more money you're not paying when you realize how much you're not paying on the shipping so this is just a great day a marvelous opportunity to pick these up please don't miss them because something like this happens so infrequently this is not Brand X my friends this is all-clad and take a look at this this is the 12 inch size that's the other thing I love about it so you have all that capacity I have served five but there's still three there's eight giant boneless pork chops in here look at this sauce thick of the sauce now here's the thing I said before you're getting that incredible searing you just don't get that kind of searing flavor with any other with any other cooking because this stainless steel literally grabs the food initially but then it releases it so you get the flavor and then when you dig lays with the stock or the white wine look at the sauce and flavor you cannot get that and out of your pan and this is why the best restaurants I talk about all the time why the chefs love it and here's the other thing David I talked about it lasting a lifetime this is metal utensil safe you're never going to have to worry you can go in with a metal utensil you can't scratch or hurt there's no coatings or chemicals on the dishwasher with this right into the deck of the dishwasher and use your metal utensils if you need to this is going very quickly now everybody's realizing oh my gosh there's no reorder I've got to get this before it's gone and it is starting to fly don't miss out on this with six easy payments free shipping and handling will it work on induction cooktop and yes certainly will it absolutely will it'll work on your electric and gas stove tops as well don't miss out on this remember everything in our show today is for pay or better this is six easy payments so we're making something really extraordinary for you don't miss out on this opportunity because I am sorry to say that if we sell this out today and it looks like we might then this is not coming back there's no reorder on this I feel worth at 1,800 now look out looking at released all that flavor David so you don't have to worry about cleanup it releases that flare back into your dish and again multi technique cooking searing braising into the oven this is a a chicken cacciatore we did here super simple classic dish but you sear the chicken first and again I'll go back to the size this 12 inches huge David but again solid stainless steel handles and rivets there's nothing on here that you can ship I can go in with metal utensils I could cut in here with a knife if I wanted to I could use a wire whisk you never have to worry about damaging it it's going to last you a lifetime and you're going to get all that performance that the best chefs around world choose to use this and that's why I love it I'll tell you when you once you get this home and start cooking in that you'll wonder why you ever cook in anything else and admittedly these pans are typically investment pricier today it's a sale price that you cannot pass up because there is no reorder on this set of two we're not going to be able to bring this set of two back in as an individual set and so you're getting it today at nearly half price from the regular QVC price from the retail value we're over a hundred and twenty seven dollars less so you're looking at an extraordinary Buy and now half the quantity is gone we have 1200 left we've got hundreds of people on the phone lines yes there's easy pay on that great sale price but one more piece of bad news a sale price goes way in today Oh No so that means we have now over half of our quantity gone and what's left will only be at this price until end of day today but I don't think there's any chance we're going to come close to that our foodies have been waiting on all clad to come on a special sale price they've been wanting to try the skillets the most used vessel in your kitchens right so now you've got a chance to buy not one but two for a price

question you've got a bag of marbles where you've got red blue and green marbles 15 of the marbles are red a third of them are blue and a quarter of them agree so you need to work out what fraction of the marbles are red in order to do that you need to work out what fraction of blue and green in total so what would be the group the green and the blue so if we add the blue and the green marbles together we'll get the total of blue and green marbles so we need to add 1/3 and 1/4 and of course we can't add fractions with different denominators so we have to multiply this side by 4 it is our lowest common multiple and this side by 3 we'll be converting these fractions now into the first one will be 4 12 and the second one will be 3 12 so that's going to give us 7 12 so the amount of blue and green marbles that we have of 7 12 and the only other types of marbles we've got our red so that must mean that how many per what is the fraction of red well the fraction of red must be 1 minus the blue and the green because there are only those three different colors one can be written as 12 12 because we don't want to in just the number 1 so if we write 1 as 12 12 that's the whole fraction minus the 7 twelfths but with a blue and the green this has to give us the amount of red as a fraction the fraction of red will be 12 12 minus 7 12 subtracting fractions nice and easy with math we're counting in 12 so the denominator stays the same and we just do 12 minus 7 it's fine so we now know that these 15 red are actually five twelfths of the marbles are 15 we know that this fraction 512 is actually the number of marbles that we have which is 15 so what would 112 be if we divide by five would get what 1/12 would be 1/12 would be 15 over 5 which would be 3 so we now know that 1/12 of our marbles is 3 what would 12:12 to be that would be all our marbles would be 12 12 which would be the number that's 1 12 times 12 of course so it'd be 3 times 12 so we have 36 marbles in total are we sure we've done it right well we have a quick check here if we were to take a quarter of the marbles 36 divided by 4 that would give us 9 green marbles if we were to take 36 divided by 3 that would give us 12 blue marbles and if we've done that right and we add these numbers up 15 plus 12 would be 27 plus 9 would be 36 we'll get 36 which was the total that we got here so the nice thing about this system is it takes a little bit of while to work it out it's very structured it's very organized you're working out how many marbles are the blue and green as a total fraction subtract that fraction from 1 to work out how many are the red you know that 512 of the marbles are red work out what 1/12 is then and then you can work out the whole number of marbles so it takes a while but it's a problem-solving question it's supposed to take a little one", "BEJ2EidVP8M": "hi and this is mark from ereplacementparts.com today we're going to destroy a trimmer a lot of customers don't realize what happens if you put the wrong fuel in your two cycle equipment being fuel without oil mixed into it that oil is there to lubricate the cylinder to piston if the oil is not in your gas when you put it in your trimmer basically the piston rubs against the cylinder and destroys your tool so what we're going to do here is exactly what you hope you'd never do and that is put straight gasoline into the trimmer so like say says gas has no oil in it at all that ought to do cap back on around my hearing and eye protection and we'll blow this thing up okay here we go and that's a seized engine right there you can see the cord won't pull what has happened is the piston is actually welded itself to the cylinder this Kerber is now worthless and the repair would cost more than the tools worth that's why you don't want to put straight gas in your two cycle equipment and we'll talk a little more about mixed oil here a minute before we talk about mix oil let me show you real quick what happened to our trimmer you can see I spent the last few minutes disassembling the trimmer here's what I found this is our piston and you can see the deep score marks on the piston all the way around and that's where it was rubbing right against the cylinder or the wall of our cylinder and if you can see in there there's gall marks which match up exactly to the gall marks on the piston so that's what happens when we took us apart actually how to beat the piston out of the cylinder using a punch it was really wedged in there so again good example of why you need to use the proper ratio of mix oil to gas in your two cycle engines we have on our website at ereplacementparts.com a table that will show you the proper mix ratios for the various size gas cans or amounts of gas you may be using and if you just refer to that our articles section you can use that to make sure that you use the proper amount of oil in your mix gasoline", "CLDYOdt27yQ": "hey guys it's mr. craw and today we're gonna review what time signatures mean in terms of both the top and the bottom number and we're gonna talk about a brand new time signature which is 3/8 time so to prepare you for this 3/8 time let's just look at at common times to ensure we've seen before which is 3/4 time and I think most people know this already the top 3 means there are 3 beats in each measure and the bottom 4 tells us that the quarter note equals one beat now the problem is that a lot of people don't really understand what this bottom 4 really means why does a 4 mean that a quarter note equals one so if you think of this time signature 3/4 instead of a time signature if you think of it as a fraction you would draw it like this and if you think about how you say this fraction you'd say 3/4 3/4 now this word fourth is kind of funny because it actually has a synonym instead of calling our particular rhythm a fourth note you know that it is really called a quarter note so it's a little bit confusing because we say 3/4 we could say 3/4 now if you did say 3/4 it makes it really obvious that we're talking about three quarter notes per measure so the trick really to time signatures is just turning it into a fraction and thinking of the top number as the beats and the bottom number as what gets the beat don't forget that your rhythm tree is affected by the bottom number so if the quarter note equals one and 4/4 time then a half note has to equal to a whole note has to equal for an eighth note has to equal a half let's take a look at a different time signature this is cut time also can be written as two two time this one's kind of tricky if you turn it into a fraction how do you say that fraction two halves not to tooth's not two seconds two halves so really this time signature means that there are two half notes per measure and the half note equals one two halves again our rhythm tree is affected by that bottom number since the half note equals one all no equals two quarter note equals one-half eighth note if you even have any eighth notes would be 1/4 of a beat so onto our new time signature with an 8 on the bottom so let's just use what we just learned about in 3 4 & 2 2 time and apply that in 3/8 first step turn it into a fraction name the fraction 3/8 that's a really easy one because we definitely have eighth notes so this time signature means that there are three beats per measure and the eighth note gets the count and then once again we have to figure out all of our rhythms because our rhythm tree has changed since the eighth note is 1 we still keep the relationship with all of our other rhythms so if an eighth note equals one quarter note is double that to half note is double a quarter four and a whole note is double a half note or 8 times as long as an eighth note 8 now it's important to note that in 3/8 time it's not actually possible to have either a half note or an eighth note because there's only three beats possible you need to measure now you are going to come across a couple of rhythms that are not on our rhythm tree some dotted rhythms that you're gonna need to know you can see a lot of dotted quarters and you can either figure that out by saying okay a quarter notes worth two and dot is worth half of that which is one so that must equal three or if you remember previously our dotted quarter notes were worth one and a half now you're gonna basically be doubling that and twice one and a half is three you're also possibly gonna see some dotted half notes now again this isn't going to be possible in 3/8 time but it might be possible in 6/8 or higher and a dotted half note again half note normally worth four half of 4 is 2 and so a dotted half note is worth a total of six beats you'd only be able to see that rhythm in 6/8 time or higher six eight seven eight eight eight nine eight so the main idea here in anything with an eight on the bottom is that from what you're used to you're probably going to need to look at all of your rhythms and just play them twice as long as what you're used to now I do want to warn you that not too far in the future we're going to change this definition of 3/8 in fact we're going to do something completely different with time signatures where this bottom eighth doesn't mean that the eighth note gets one in fact that bottom eighth is going to mean eventually down the road that a dotted quarter note equals one and that completely defies logic that's going to be coming up in a couple weeks I'll make a separate video about that but I do want you to understand that pretty soon we're gonna be changing this pretty easy definition of 3/8 and to something that's a little trickier well we'll talk about that later don't worry about that right now", "Z16X-lKOMhw": "and here we go this is a whole bunch of bottles of silicone shock oil these are specifically made by RC companies for use in RC vehicles these are not off-the-shelf oils that you'll find in a hardware store or anything like that these are very specifically formulated for use with RCS and they're available from multiple manufacturers and they come in different weights or thicknesses so all of these here are from one manufacturer team low C and you can see that they have the numbers on on the top those represent the weight of the oil the higher the number the thicker the oil is which means it will have more resistance on the action of the spring and the action of the suspension now to show you the difference that weight makes or a thickness of the oil mix I'm just going to turn this around and let you see the level of it just look at the top as I shake it around see how it looks kind of thin it's able to pour out pretty easily and that's because this is a very thin oil this is ten weight oil and now looking over at some thicker stuff this is the real thick stuff this is 90 weight made by a different company you can just see it's it's filled up to here and as I turn it smoothing a lot more slowly because this is a thicker or more viscous oil now to really show you the difference I'm going to show you some super thick silicone oil now this is not used for shocks this is actually used for differentials it's a completely different component but I just want you to see watch the bubble on this one see how slowly it's moving that's how thick silicone oil can get as a matter of fact you can get up to ten even a 50 times thicker than that now for Springs this is something that I like very much it's one of my drawers of Springs now Springs specifically made for RCS are available in different lengths and different levels of stiffness so over here I've got some really soft Springs it's pretty easy to compress compare that over to this side where I've got a much stiffer spring yeah significantly stiffer the difference between these two Springs that I just showed you is about two times so this is about twice as stiff as the previous one now different companies use different methods for indicating the stiffness of a spring so that you can tell just by looking at it what you've got in this case both of these Springs are from a company called low C and they code their their Springs in this size by color so the different colors mean different different stiffnesses in this case it's the gray is the it's either the gray or the white is the very weakest that they offer going all the way up to the black the black is actually the stiffest in this case and Springs are also available in different lengths so here I've got some orange Springs but they're in different lengths they're both from the same company but they're available in different lengths in this case these longer ones which are two and a half inches long are made to be used on the rear of a truck or buggy in one-tenth scale these shorter ones are two inches long and they're made to be used for a also truck or buggy but for the front of it some companies don't use such an obvious scheme for showing you what is the rating of a different spring especially nowadays for rates or racers tend to not like to let other people know what they're using on their vehicles so here I've got two Springs from the same company when I was just a little bit longer than the other but these have very different spring rates to them one on the left is much softer the one on the right is much stiffer and you'll notice that they're both all almost all white except for just these little dots so in this case the little red dot which you can kind of turn away and and hide with some of the other components it makes it so that your competitors at a racetrack won't necessarily be able to easily see what type of Springs that you're using for your setup the red in this case means it's the softer one and the black means it's the most stiff spring rate as I mentioned before the springs on a vehicle are for holding it up holding its weight up off the ground and also keeping it from leaning too much in turns we had very very soft Springs on a vehicle for one thing it's not going to be able to hold up the weight it would just kind of drag along on the ground and also when you go into a turn the whole thing would just lean way over so that's basically in a nutshell what your Springs are going to be doing your Springs are not to help you to land big jumps your Springs are just there to hold the vehicle up and to keep it at a certain level height that you want it to be at now speaking of height there are a couple things that I want to show you first of all as I just mentioned the stiffness of the spring will determine how well the suspension is able to hold up the entire vehicle but there are a couple other things that factor into the height of the vehicle off of the ground first of all spring length now I'm going to show you two springs of practically the same level of stiffness attached to the exact same shock now here's my shock assembled with the longer one of those Springs you can see that the the shock is fully extended out and it's ready to do its job now given that amount of height of spring and the stiffness or rate of the spring when you put weight on this vehicle it's going to sit at a certain level now compare that with this full-length shock the full-length spring so when I take this spring off and replace it with the shorter spring now you can already see that there's a problem here this spring is too short what that's going to do is let the whole vehicle sit much lower to the ground but in this case it also is leaving a whole bunch of the space down here where basically the shock is going to be working but the spring isn't going to be doing any work at all and as the vehicle goes around over bumpy terrain spring could even completely fall off to the side and just really stop working well but there's something that you can do to help deal with a spring that's too short and also to help set your height of your vehicle where you want it to be and that is to use spring preload you", "352nSGH5_Q4": "hello guys welcome back to my channel this is - ah yes change my hair again that my hair and this is actually not a fringe it's a the other part of my hair but I'm just wearing it like a fridge so today I'm finally making a video on how I bleached my hair at home and I just wanted to tell you how freakin top foot it was it I uploaded a video a few weeks ago a week ago I don't know an Instagram this is me but this absolutely gorgeous platinum blonde hair and yes I missed his hairs so ah first time I ever bleached my hair was when I was like 10 maybe or 12 my mom came back home so did she leave it smacked me I was not allowed to do lots of stuff back then and then after that I just took my hair - my natural hair color my initial hair color is not super like peach like like it's pretty bright for Asian colors selectee I'll say brownish and then when I got into a uni I just shared my hair color to a slightly Brown kind of color but later then when I wanted to get a job as a flight attendant I just had to go back to my natural hair color is because in Korea in service industry they wanted to have very natural hair color especially enough airline companies you just cannot dye your hair when first time I got a job I was told from my manager to dye my hair to pitch black because they thought I dyed my hair because my hair is slightly brown so I just had to like constantly die into a black and black and black and then when I cook this job the first thing I did was bleaching my hair and getting a piercing done my dear friend Janet came to go home and she helped me with bleaching my peeps off my hair and then I just continued bleaching the tip of my hair basically half of my hair was normal color my natural color and the other was bleached okay since last year I really wanted to go platinum blonde but I could not because I have to get married and I didn't want to have very unnatural for me as an Asian hair color in my wedding day so I just went to this guy this hair selling is called Austin to tell you he's name is Daniel very cool and nice guy and their hair salon is so amazingly beautiful it just looks like some gallery does not look like typical hair salon they even have a freaking rub my type of thing probably it's a tiny ball you don't need to love this one but I just wish my hair all the time look at this it's something like my face this is smell terrible like I don't feel anything right now they like to delete you my parents even gave me a bouquet who's this delicious like the best moon thing ever tried thank you and then after wedding took my hair came back to Sydney and just made a decision that I will bleach my hair I learned at home I was actually going to back to this hair salon to bleach my hair but I just felt like I can do that I'm just I'm a person who really likes to do like try everything and the most importantly I do not like going to the hair salon because it's so lonely so boring it's just really hard for me just to sit straight for hours so I found two clips of me wishing my hair a lot in Sydney you guys can watch it hey guys look at my hair color is the same color with Jonathan's top right now so I decided to bleach my hair I decided to go like platinum blonde and this is what happened last night they don't really want to film us time because it was too dark when I was filming it right now I this is how I look right now it's not gonna get to where you want oh darling you don't know anything it took only one like bleach for me because I already had like kind of bleach hair it was pretty bright for normal Asian here it will take like maybe two bleaches to achieve base color okay now I need to dry my hair and started bleaching it again look at this color ugly in X plus light I put this all applies all over my hair and I went to sleep so I'll be using this is my like bleach developer 30 air tubes and the brush of a plastic bowl all you need to do is make Swift if you see it and [Music] start with either because this part is the most dark spot okay it's like I've never really played here you know like so the hearings we did dark inside because your wall roots are pretty warm and the bleach will work better around the roots of just a living space here and by here I will just cover up again [Music] okay no no okay now we'll go back to the root and I'll just cover up for it's a little bit just finished applying all these bushes of my hair and my scalp is burning it's worse than yesterday but it was a second day and actually I got something on my neck right now it's like so red Jonah told me that I got some blisters so probably my skin is not really strong I'll wait for about like like one minute and I'll wash it all off it slightly kind of like not even orange a yellow but I think it has a bit of peach tone underlie over here and I have like slightly like white Taurasi roots so I tried to my purple shampoo but it did not really work so I ordered finola no yellow shampoo yesterday so hopefully it will be okay after I tried it but today because I cannot go out anywhere like this but actually I can't but I just don't really want to go up in your like this I'll be just dyeing my hair again and I it's pretty bad decision it's not really good for my hair but I really hate this color right now so I'm just gonna go with this cold ice tide rose bloomed from L'Oreal let's do it Oh Oh pretty bad oh my comics is so strong Oh vehicles starting with fruits and I think I'll try to put both color and talk about here because I don't think I have very enough of mixture itself and I'll try to put more on mining route just in case oh then you have enough and make let's make it look like a bit of like over here maybe [Music] not to utilize beyond okay teacher to time ago senator Ichiro multi lateral priority job to you know God will guitar player without know this is still ugly yellow Indra so it's really like I really need purple shampoo but the purple shocker that I have I hope I'm not sure how the brand is called but something saying that hey there okay that promotion booth did not really work for me so in order for all of us currently find all the best hi bad guys this is still heavy oh this is it you finally received my panel and the yellow is Sheldon let's try it hopefully it will work pretty well my hair still has like a little bit of pink it's not even pinking oh it's a bit like closer to peach so I have no clue how this will turn out after I washed with this purple shampoo like that okay good morning so today's my friend's wedding day so right now it's 6:30 a.m. I usually sleep this time this time if you know this my hair is so right now and also it's quite yellow and also I put a little bit of all of my skull last night before going to bed because I am going to bleach my hair today when I bleached my hair last time I just like bleach it on my really clean washed hair and apparently you can have a bit of oil cuz the bleach goes through the oil so yeah I was kind of domed this time this is the reason why I like put a bit of hair oil last night okay this is the door to our bathroom and honestly I do not want to film in here because so yeah I don't see anything in here we are all with Jensen thinking of renovating this whole bathroom but um still haven't decided yet terminus which my hair I use any of this kind of stuff I bury my skin my back of my neck the lesson here over here looks like No oh yeah guys it's pink do you know why is pink because obviously I love my hair never bleach your roots at home so this whole thing began with me just trying to bleach my hair my route at home and the first bleach was okay it was all good it was just normal my hair didn't get damaged but second I just started watching new handle John and forgot that I have a bleach on my hair then I just rushed to wash my hair and then I notice that water is not going through the drain the drain is caught and do you know why because I had this city's this bunch of hair blocking the drain so my hair started melting not underneath just only on the top part and now I have this like tiny pieces right in the center of my head I really truly was so close to just shaving my head Kjell it like this if you guys are planning to bleach your hair alone at home you guys really should watch this part first like this is very important this is warning for you and maybe after watching this you might not want to bleach your hair at home number one your a every single heard especially your scalp will get so much scars and all these residues not residue of what's called discharge discharge yes it will be everywhere on your scalp bleach spray my scalp so bad especially because I was stupid I bleached my hair and freshly washed in clean hair it's better for your skull to bleach your hair on the dirty hair but I did not know that PI so I just every time I bleach my hair again I will just freshly washed my hair and my scalp is dry and everything is more sensitive and I totally ruined my scalp really bad and also you will get lots of scars on the back of your neck especially if you don't use any protection I bring back of my knife really bad and it looks like pimples like acne scar ok second so arms your face your like breathing system everything will hurt so bad it will be so painful like not talking about the scalp or and the other part that will directly touch the bleach I wanted to give up so many times you look great ok Jenna got new clothes he likes it great yeah the bleach is so strong that your face is not even touching the bleach but it hurts just like breathing is so painful everything is just painful and painful third it might turn on really patchy if you don't have any ones can help you with it like all the parts of your hair will have a different color like I don't bleach your hair [Music] seeing the back of your head is way harder than what you think the bleach melts your hair the will damage your hair to the next level we see this part the fringe especially this is not supposed to be a fringe over here everything the short part on the top of my head it's all melted number six do not least your roots at home do not do it this has happened because I tried to fish my rich at home and it's way harder than pitching a whole your head because you have to please just only the sternum part and applying the bleach only on this area is actually way harder than what I thought now I will talk about the products that you have to use the first thing that you really have to have when you bleach your hair at home is the olaplex number three that you use it in between every single bleach process it helps to you know prevent the damage of your hair like and then if you want to have really nice color on Lola no yellow shampoo this works perfectly and you can achieve that great each hair color you works on the like yellow precedence but not on the orange Ness I tried so many different brands but nothing worked as much as this one and also this is the products that I used recently a lot before covering my hair dark again but is it 20 moly personal like a regular color and treatment in ash violet and stylist easy quick hair color treatment in Rose cuffs so I just washed my hair first finish everything squeeze the water out and then I mix this two products 52:15 and then I start with the root part and just just go down and it will give me a really natural hombre kind of your fetch and like it looks way better after like two or three washes but it does not last a long time okay and also for your haircare this is a product that I love love to use for an extra Carey Codd eat a lines intense nourishing day cream very dry hair actually really love all their carita lines I also like to use their night cream and oil this whole line just saved my hair a lot lost repairing well actually haven't tried this yet but I tried clear hair mask and that is absolutely correct as well I guess that's it let me know if you have any questions and I will see you again in my next video thanks for watching bye bye if you want healthy hair like mine [Music] then reach ahead you taught me what I was saying I whip my hair back and forth", "ZOyd9-X5I5Y": "oh then today I'm going to show you how to measure out four liters of liquid when you've only got a five liter container and a three liter container and unlimited supply of liquid now if you want to think about the answer press on the pause button in the top bottom left hand corner otherwise I'm going to go straight into the answer so so what we'll do there we'll fill up the three liter container first and obviously that is these are just scale models that doesn't actually hold three liters but just for the video I've just done it as a scale model and you can apply the same principle if you want to work out the you know measure for gallons and you've got a five gallon in a three gallon container or four ounces and you've got a five ounce and a through or and a three ounce container so there we go we've got three liters of liquid in the three liter container so we'll pour that into the five and so five and then we've got two liters remaining of space in that five liter container and so we're going to fill up the three liter container again fill that up to the brim and we'll pour that into the five liter container and obviously it'll only take two out of that three liters we'll go into the five and we'll left be left with one liter then in the three liter container and now we're just going to empty out that five liter container yep put that to one side and then we'll pour the 1 liter that's left in the 3 liter into the fight fill up the 3 liter container again you're going to fill that up to the brim and pull that into the 5 liter container we've got one liter in there and we pour in three that means we're left with four letters in the 5 liter container so there we go we've measured out four letters using four litres of liquid using a five liter container and a three liter container", "4etYbU4j5c8": "welcome to Lexus world and today we're gonna have a video that will mostly be useful to you newbie cannabis consumers and to you ones who want to save some money so how much weed should you buy per purchase I'll start by saying that for the purposes of this discussion I'm going to assume that you know how to store cannabis properly meaning not in a ziplock baggie a link to my episode on proper storage in the video description for the rest of you if you know how to store weed properly you don't have to worry about how long the buds will be good for so instead you can now focus on what's the best deal the common denominations of cannabis are of course one gram also known as a dime three and a half grams which is an eight seven grams which is a quarter of 14 grams which is half an ounce and 28 grams which is your ounces in both the legal and the black cannabis market there is a time-honored precedent in terms of price breaks for going up in terms of weight purchased so it's like most other products my advise breaks down into two categories for casual smokers who might smoke weed once per month if that and heavy users if you're a casual smoker you should avoid grams which is a very bad deal to buy because the price per gram will be heavily inflated those users should go for an 8 instead that jump to three and a half grams gets you pretty significant price breaks almost everywhere over a single gram and with proper storage you can just take that weed out once per month and slowly go through it over the course of a year for you heavy users my advice is buying by the ounce or even bigger denominations if it's legal and you can get some kind of additional price break and I'll justify that let's say you smoke even one gram of weed per week which means you smoked two to three times a week that's 52 grams of weed a year if you buy that by a single gram the price might be $10 a gram that translates into five hundred and twenty dollars on weed for the year change that purchasing to an ounce and that will give you for example a very average price of a hundred and ninety an ounce or six seventy eight a gram suddenly your costs per year are three hundred and fifty two bucks so you save over a hundred and sixty-five dollars in just one year plus you save tons of trips traveling back and forth to your weed provider by the way if you smoke a gram per day as many of my viewers do what you save per year in that example works out to eleven hundred and seventy five dollars the difference between buying one denomination versus another adds up big-time over the course of a year and even more over the course of many years so please bear it in mind when you buy also bear in mind I need your subs likes and comments to live so please subscribe to the show and hit that like button we'll see you next time",

taking guys along on an artificial turf job that me my buddy completed Sam we both work for my dad and this was a job that we were doing after work after hours and we're going to be taking about three inches out of the three inches of dirt out of this job and the job was roughly 120 square feet 120 240 somewhere around there and I didn't have a string line on me or anything like that so I just broke out my D Walt laser level I just set the grade to the concrete height and then I was just going to use a small stake and a measuring tape to check my levels see how deep I was overall for the whole job which is you know I wanted about three inches overall so I was just checking this first little piece that we dug out so I can pretty much just go off that and just eyeball everything and then go back with the laser level and check and make sure that has three inches overall and the great thing was about this job was I had to pay me dumb fees for this job because I took all the dirt to Brea this landfill spot where they're just taking free dirt so if we were in Orange County and you need to spot to dump dirt Braes place to go they take free dirt so that was pretty nice and that was a nice little money saver dirt was pretty soft as well since we've been getting a lot of rain in Southern California which is good and bad bad for work good for you know the drought so this was actually a job that me and Sam were going to after hours working with my dad we'd hit the morning shift with my dad and then after work we'd go to this job which made us on a tight schedule since a lot of the places that we need to go to close around 5:00 p.m. these two main places being the dump and where we pick up the base material which both closed fairly early about three or four like I was saying so my options for getting base material was limited now the base material we picked up isn't the the normal base material I usually gift for laying artificial turf on top of the basement field I picked up is was a three quarter aggregate and a little larger rocks to normal normally I'd get something like a sandy concrete base use something about 1/8 of Agra inside or less but I mean this still works and this is actually a very strong base as well for turf the only thing I don't like about this base is the 3/4 aggregate that seems to always be protruding in from the base even after you've called back to dip you know for a good amount of time so it makes it a little bit harder to lay the artificial turf down flat we see Sammy's in the big rake trying to get a nice flat surface for us the flattest surface you can get the base material the better you're going to be off when you start laying down the turf with NOAA air pockets underneath that was the goal for this really so we got this base nice and wet and we get right over it with the compactor my compacted this thing for a good like 30 minutes or so non-stop just going over it so it made the surface really nice and hard and then I just checked it with level making sure that everything's grading our draining right into the turf area and to make sure that it's draining away from the house because we don't want the water going towards the house so I built up the base rock a little bit higher against the house but just enough underneath the weeps creat so that if any water you know hits the stucco gets behind the stucco you would drain out under the weep screed now here's the artifice turf that we got we we get artificial turf action at Tiger turf so it's pretty reasonable place reasonably priced and I think there are products really nice and good you know my buddy Edgar is the one that recommended me to them and he's the one that has shown me how to do artificial turf if you guys have seen one of our last videos of an artificial turf video he was alone installing the whole drum so pretty much we used a 15 by 10 piece for the shop so there's no seams involved one nice flat seamless artificial turf space which is ideal because then you don't have to have any seams and it's just nice and seamless so it makes like it makes it look really a lot better you can always hide the seams everything but you know if you don't have to then I would recommend not to now here I am cutting out this artificial turf around this drain and pretty much to get a straight cut you just follow the seams where the artificial turf blades are sewed into I'll get I believe I got some more closed up later on so you guys will be able to see that a little better and then right here I'm actually having to cut across the artificial turf Soudan seams so that makes it a little more difficult to get straight cuts but so long as you have a good eye and you keep checking by putting it back up against whatever you're butting it up against you should be okay all that side where that blue stuff is on the edge of doctor surface will be taking that off for sure can't use that stuff now there's Sam cutting the long piece down I'm just getting a closer view for you guys to show you how it's done if you've never done our first a turf before just follow the seam straight down make sure you're pretty much flush but up riding in the artificial are the concrete because later on at the very end we tuck their very in into the dirt and between pretty much right between the base and the concrete so that no weeds will grow up between the artificial turf and concrete now I'll show that later on in the video now what I have in my hand right now is called a knee kicker using a lot of carpeting and we're gonna be starting off actually is against the wall and we're putting a ton of nails and these are six inch galvanized nails we're putting a bunch of these in to make sure that this turf does not lift up but we have no problems in the future and the secret to making sure that these nails are hidden is when you're putting the nails in what you want to do is have another nail and you pretty much just grab the blades back with one of the nails and then drive the hammer in and then at the very end once you've dry driven the nail in you just come back with the nail and pick any blaze that might have got caught by the nail as he's doing right now he's picking any blades that might have been caught wouldn't hammering the head down and that's what how we did every single nail making sure not to grab any blades when driving the nails in because then your Turk is gonna look kind of like a Dalmatian and you don't want that so we're just trying to get this terrific laughs possible oh and right there what I did was I snapped a chalk line across this turf so that because we're going against the seams right now where the artificial turf blades are sewed into so we wanted to get a straight line so we just snapped a line where we needed to cut so that we can get it nice and tight against that house and then I'm over there at the corner with the knee kicker and I almost start again any loose turf pulled to the edge towards the house I'm Sam just cleaning up the edge near the concrete if there is any like turf that needs to be cut back a little bit so that we can flush it really nice and close up against to it and with enough to tuck under it so you can see that I am hitting with a knee kicker and you can see I'm pulling the turf where there it needs to be pulled a little bit to make sure that everything gets nice and flat and now means them are doing the whole artificial turf space going one direction pulling it in one way so that as we keep going we can keep putting nails in keep it locked in place and keep kicking it towards one direction and then I went back and hit all the nails in and Sam handled all the edges and again guys the base is a very important factor when putting artificial turf in because if you don't have the right base you're just gonna have you're gonna be struggling with those kind of those little bumps and pockets that we had that's why I had to use a knee kick or so much to straighten out this turf so as you can see guys in the bottom of the screen it's starting to rain on us it's starting to sprinkle a little bit on us so I was really trying to struggle and get that a pet-friendly and fill in as fast as I could before I really started to pull on us which we did get in time before the rain side and hit us and got everything spread out evenly with that power sweeper but once you put all the sand fill in even if you put it in a little heavy in some areas you can only spread it out just takes a little bit longer but it's better to get I think I believe you would want depending on how much traffic flow you're gonna be having about one pound of interval per square foot and then like I was saying earlier in the video guys this is the tucking the edges in so that no weeds can grow up on the corner it ends you just tuck those edges in right between the crevice of the concrete and the base and this is pretty much the final product so if you guys have any questions or some things were unclear of how to explain them just let me know guys and I'll try to work on it in the future but I hope you got to learn something and enjoy the video thanks for watching and don't forget to Like share and subscribe guys we really appreciate it have a good day", "5J6wNdD8j64": "ratio of the number of chocolates Gaurav received to the number of chocolates chair received is 2s2 3 and that can also be written as 2 by 3 we have seen that 2 by 3 can be written in different ways we can multiply the numerator as well as the denominator by 2 and get 4 by 6 or we can also multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3 to get 6 by 9 all these three ratios have the same value if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same value the ratio remains unchanged even if we divide the numerator and the denominator by the same value the ratio remains unchanged let's consider the ratio 12 by 18 we can divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 6 the numerator will be 12 by 6 and the denominator will be 18 by 6 12 by 6 is 2 and 18 by 6 is 3 12 by 18 and 2 by 3 are the same 2 by 3 is called the simplest form it means this cannot be reduced further but how did we know what number we're supposed to divide them by the number 6 is actually the highest common factor of the numerator and the denominator if we divide the numerator as well as the denominator by the HCF we get the simplest form say we have the ratio 30 by 50 let's assume that we do not know what their HCF is if we do not know what the HCF is all we need to do is look for the common factors of the numerator and the denominator 30 and 50 are both divisible by 2 so we divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 2 30 divided by 2 is 15 and 50 divided by 2 is 25 if there are no common factors of the numerator and the denominator it leaves us with the answer in the standard form but 15 and 25 both have 5 as that common factor which tells us that this is not the simplest form we divide the numerator as well as the denominator by 5 15 divided by 5 is 3 and 25 divided by 5 is 5 the numbers 3 & 5 do not have any common factors apart from 1 so this is the standard form of the ratio 30 by 50 the product of all the numbers which we divided the numerators and the denominators by will be their HCF here 2 times 5 which equals 10 is the HCF of 30 and 50 i would recommend you to first find the HCF and then divide the numerator and the denominator by just once instead of performing division several times", "sAbQO1F_7Z0": "so now I'm going to show you how to calculate how much to add to your pool to raise your level it's pretty basic I'm just going to give you the basic formula to use you can apply it to your pool depending on how big it is so let's say that your chlorine in is 1.0 and you want to raise it to 3.0 you're going to use the liquid chlorine which is 12.5% active chlorine available chlorine so I'm going to show you how to calculate that right now here's example that I give you video you have a pool that is 22,000 gallons you want to raise it by a two per million with that in that box step 2 is you take two twenty two thousand divided by ten thousand gallons which is a standard amount that they'll put on the package or bottle for the dosage so that comes out to two point two and a step three is the amount it would take to raise it by one part per million now put the chart in the comment section and for the 12% liquid chlorine take ten point six ounces to raise it one part per million in 10,000 gallons of water so I'll show you how to add that together to get your reading so we'll take box 1 which is 2 parts per million we want to raise it all times that by 2 point 2 which is number we got from dividing 22,000 grounds with 10,000 and then we times that by how much ounces it would take to raise at one part per million which was ten point six that'll give us our reading of forty six point six four ounces to raise that chlorine level by two parts per million using liquid chlorine so again you got the pool size swing to count thousand gallon step one is how much you want to raise it by which is two parts per million step two would you take the amount of gallons in your pools which was twenty two thousand divide that by ten thousand that I give you 2.2 and then step three you want to raise it it would take ten point six ounces of liquid chlorine at 12 percent to raise it one part parts per million you get this number here from the chart I'm going to give you in the comment section in the new x part box one by box to buy box three and that gives you how much chlorine to add to the pool so it's a pretty easy way to calculate your gallonage and of course if you add it and you don't get the desired result your pool may be too large and if you add it and get more chlorine than you want then your pool may be smaller than you think you that's the maintenance dose of the chemical if you're going your pool the bag will have the amount on it pretty much I'll give you also a cut screen with the amount on there but basically if you're going to shock your pool you'll add the amount in there to get your chlorine level 10 parts per million the reason why I want to do that is because if your pool has cloudy water you Mon your bonds with the chlorine molecule really well it's a really strong bond and so you have to shock you pull the break that and oxidize the pool and you'll know that most of that that you put in there will be enough by the organics in the water and contaminants in the water so the ten parts per million shock treatment won't raise your chlorine for that level for a long period of time it just tries to get the chlorine activated and get you free chlorine at a high level so that the pool will clear up you so if you're just maintaining your flowing level and full like this or it's pretty clear then use the main insouciant that i recommend it and again only use the chalk ptosis can pull have issues I'm probably going to run into with the three trial or Tablas is that one of the factors with the tablets is the water temperature so the melt of course quicker and hotter water also when you put them if you put them in a offline or inline coordinator they'll actually melt a lot quicker also since water is flowing through a continuously by the pool is running versus a floater and you can adjust your floater also with various settings if you're using a standard floater you can actually close and open it so it as also as a difficulty because the dispensers are all different also so the only way to actually use the trial or properly and get the measurement is to start off with more tablets and then cut back gradually as the free chlorine level drops so you can start with less tablets and add more into them I prefer the other way because that way the pool will maintain a chlorine reading so if you put three tablets in the floor let's say and you're getting a 5.0 Goren reading then you probably have too many go to one and a half tablets so next week see if that cuts it down so the tablets are kind of hit and miss as far as getting the right amount even though the manufacturer gives you a dosage chart there's still a lot of variable so they even put it in their instructions that one or two ounces of this product usually will maintain it to one to three parts per million available chlorine but of course again the dispensers are all set differently and it's kind of hard to get it adjusted at first you have to kind of play with the trike or tablet adjustment to get the right level", "fZtUn_THXnk": "Toby is a farmer. He plants 12 rows of\ncarrots in a field. Each row has 6 carrots. How many carrots did Toby plant? So let's try to\nvisualize this thing. So they tell us each\nrow has 6 carrots. So let's try to visualize a row. So that's 1 carrot,\nthat's 2 carrots, that's 3 carrots, that's 4\ncarrots, that's 5 carrots, and that's 6 carrots. And I can even do,\njust so it looks nice, the little leafy\npart of the carrots. So we can visualize\nthese as carrots. So that's 1 row of carrots. They tell us each\nrow has 6 carrots. Now, there're 12 of these. He plants 12 rows of carrots. Let me see if I can\ncopy and paste this. So copy and paste. So that's 2 rows. I want to make sure\nI have enough space. 2 rows. That's 3 rows. That's 4 rows. This is 5 rows. This is 6 rows. And actually, I can just copy\nand paste the whole thing. This is 6 rows. I just need to double\nthat to get to 12 rows. So let me do that. So copy and paste. There you go. So there's 12 rows\nright over here. And let's number this. So they tell us each row has\n6 carrots-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They tell us he\nplants a total of 12 rows-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. How many carrots did Toby plant? Well, you could do\nthis exercise and then try to count all\nof these carrots. But that seems a\nlittle bit crazy. These are already\na lot of carrots. And especially if these\nwere even larger numbers, it would take you\nforever to count it. Luckily for us, we have\nmultiplication as a tool that we can use. So if you have 12 rows and\neach of those rows have 6, this is really 12 times 6. You're going to have 12 rows. In each of those,\nyou have 6 carrots. So you could say you\nhave 6 carrots 12 times. So it's going to be 12 times 6. If you remember your\nmultiplication tables up to 12, you'll remember that\n12 times 6 is 72. So he has 72 carrots. Even if you only remember--\nwell, I'll just leave it there. If you remember your\nmultiplication-- which you should, because that\nis one of the things in life that will have long-lasting\nbenefits-- it's 72 carrots.", "jWKlQgTHi_c": "here is a short guide on how to lower your gear ratios for easier climbing what you need to buy and also how to avoid some of the traps and pitfalls associated with it now before we get going I will just say if you make any adjustments to the size of your chain rings or your cassette then you will need to check the length of your chain before you ride again so make sure you do that but we will touch on it a bit more detail later on now the quickest and easiest change you can make is to swap your cassette if you count the number of teeth on the biggest sprocket at the cassette or if you look carefully it's normally written on there it'll tell you what size have already got on there most bikes have been made in the last 10 years or so will very quickly accept a 28 2 sprocket so if you've got a 23 or 25 on there already then you can quickly swap it out and it will give you a much much lower gear 25 to 28 doesn't sound like much but believe me it really will make a big difference the only adjustment you'll likely need to make on your bike is to the B tension adjustment screw which is one of the ones on the back of the derailleur and it controls where the jockey wheel sits underneath the sprockets if you turn it in then the jockey wheel should lower and that'll clear the derailleur of the new larger cassette if you've already got a 28 then you can also fit a 32 tooth cassette and they're readily available in most bike shops but it's slightly more complex as you now need to check whether or not you've got a short cage or a medium cage rear derailleur because when you increase the size of the cassette then you also increase the range and that might be too much for a short cage rear derailleur to handle it's also important that the derailleur arm clears the cassette itself now short gauge rear derailleurs often get stuck on anything bigger than a 28 which is another reason why you need a medium cage to handle a 32 tooth cassettes you very quickly sell at a glance what derailleur you've got because a short code riemeck will have only a couple of centimeters between the jockey wheels whereas a medium cage is more like 6 or 7 in some circumstances it's also possible to fit a mountain biker set on the back of your road bikes give you tiny little gears that will help you spin your way up the worst climbs that the world can throw at you you will also need to change your derailleur at this point for a mountain bike rear derailleur so that it can clear the enormous sprockets that a man biker set will give you now although I haven't tried it personally I don't believe that you can do this if you're running 11 speed because the pull ratio of mountain bikes to road bikes differs however if you're running ten speed or nine speed on the road and you can fit a nine speed Shimano derailleur and that will give you the option of using a mountain bike set that's a pretty comprehensive look at what you need to do if you're going to change your cassette what about your chain rings well fortunately it's slightly simpler although potentially a little bit more costly another thing to pay attention to is something called the BCD which is the bolt circle diameter now on a traditional chain set like that which is 5339 the BCD is 130 millimeters or if you're using Campagnolo 135 millimeters now what that means is you're restricted to a minimum of a 38 tooth and that's not a big enough difference from a 39 for us to recommend changing it unless it's worn out and you need to replace it anyway if you want to get a smaller chain ring and we suggest if you're going up big mountains that you do and you're going to need a compact chain set which has a BCD for 110 millimeters and that allows you to fit a chain ring down to 34 unfortunately most cranks made in the last year or so as you have a BCD of 110 whether they're our traditional size chain rings or they're compact and that's quite a common-sense move from the biochemistry we applaud them for doing that just be aware that if that's what you've got that you can't go and go stick a 53 on if you're running a 34 because that increases the capacity of the gears far too much for you derailers to be able to handle unless of course using Shimano di2 or surround put then that's another thing entirely the final thing to mention with chain sets is if you want super low gears you can fit a triple on there so it has three rings as opposed to two now they can be great to give you a huge spread of gears the only downside is they're not very fashionable which will matter to some people and then it won't matter a job to others if you do decide to get on the triple route and you will need to get a new left hand shifter because one that will need to shift three gears as opposed to two and then you'll also need to replace your rear derailleur for a long cage so it can handle the extra capacity that your gear ratios will give you it's worth mentioning that if you want to go from a triple back down to a double then you don't actually need a new shifter as long as you're careful when you're indexing your raela echoing what I said at the start and perhaps simplest remember is that you should always check the length of your chain after you've made any changes to your cassette or your chain ring simply put the chain in the biggest gear at the front and at the back and then also in the smallest and the smallest just to make sure that it still functions correctly so there you go a quick trips with a minefield of changing gear ratios for easier climbing virtually anyone can run a 28 to 3 sets if you want to run a 32 then you're going to need a medium cage rear derailleur and if you want to run a mountain biker set then you're going to need ten speed gears and a nine speed mountain bike really right there and at the front you should always check your BCD when you're buying new chainrings anyway to make sure they fit but if you want to go smaller than a 38 then you're going to need a compact chain set with a BCD of 110 millimeters now if the whole idea of gear ratios is got you completely lost and we actually already have a video here on GCN where Dan expertly guides us through the maze and is actually quite interesting you can get through to it by clicking just up there but if you want tips on riding up Alpine climbs of which gear ratios is just a small

dollar half ounce of california it just depends on the people that you know um this is one of my neighbors not my neighbors but unless you say he's a close friend so he plugged me up uh this is a forty dollar half ounce like or actually i think it's like 13 grams so a little bit under a half ounce but you shot it to me for 40 or 45 bucks so now i'm gonna show you guys the close-up of the weeds this is what the [ __ ] weed is looking like tell me where else you could buy a 40 half ounce like this or actually it's um like 14 oh i'm at like 13 grams i think but i forgot the straight oh peanut butter jelly this is peanut butter and jelly man look at those [ __ ] lugs [ __ ] beautiful man let me dump it in my tray for you guys turn the light on this is like 14 uh 13 grams i believe or something like that but damn bruh look at that [ __ ] that's crazy yeah that's hella crazy let me know if you guys have ever bought anything like this let me know if you guys have ever bought anything like this for forty dollars for 12 grams man other place for calibre no other place required you can sell these eights for eighty dollars in other places man the valley is where it's at bro la is taxing other place uh anything out of state is taxing man this is what 40 uh half ounce looks like almost a half pound so i'm gonna roll um probably a joint or blood lip and then uh i'll tell you guys what it's tasting like i'll show you guys the blood when it's grounded up so again y'all [ __ ] i just rolled d-joint so i'ma smoke it and i'm gonna let you guys know my opinion on it see if it tastes good see if it's getting me high and i'll show you guys the uh ash production on it [Music] off rib tastes good [Music] peanut butter and jelly isn't my peanut butter and jelly isn't my favorite string like anyways but for peanut butter and jelly this is pretty good the only reason i got it is because it was such a good deal and the ash seems white as [ __ ] comment what you guys are smoking down while watching this video whether it's wax cart weed let me know what you guys are smoking on um and make sure to turn on notifications to me just so you guys know right when i upload a video because i'm gonna do i'm gonna be doing giveaways soon so stay put those notifications on man [Music] so the ashes looking not too white not too black i won't say it's right in the middle it's not too harsh either i mean i'm not gonna lie to you guys it's a little bit harsh but it's like tolerable it still has a good flavor and everything i don't know there's something about it actually the that's just pretty white yeah that actually is pretty white let me take a look at it nah guys this is a good it has a good flavor to it the only thing is i don't really [ __ ] with peanut butter and jelly so that's probably why it tastes kind of weird to me but if you guys are a fan of it definitely recommend this train i mean if you guys haven't tried it um i would recommend it just because you never know you might like it but yeah so far it's tasting pretty good i will say it's a little bit harsher of a throttle so maybe that's why i got this for a deal but i mean it looks well grown and everything i don't know i'll get back to you guys though when i'm done with the joint and let you guys know my final thoughts it was harsh as [ __ ] not harsh as [ __ ] but it was pretty harsh like from the scale 1 to 10 it was like a 3.5 harsh it wasn't pretty enjoyable so i'm going black and then i'll let you guys know how it tastes in the blood okay bye", "6_lr5I-fxBQ": "hey guys so today we're gonna talk about how to figure out how many dread extensions you need so the two main things that factor into how many good extensions you need is how much hair you have and the size of the dreads that you want so the first one should be pretty easy to figure out either you have a full head of hair or you don't and if you don't then it's a little bit trickier for example I have a half head of hair I have both of my sides shaved in a death Hawk and so that's a type of Mohawk if you have an undercut that could also be a half head of hair but if you only have a side cut then that might be two thirds of your hair so basically how much hair you have does factor into how many dreads you need because that's what you install into additionally the thickness of your hair can make a difference for example if you have really really thick hair you might need more dreads if you have a little bit thinner hair than you might need less and so the second part of this which is the size of the dreads that you want makes the biggest difference in calculating how many you need and when I say size I mean B width or thickness of the dreads not the wing dreads come in many different sizes but on average they're about five main categories that you see them in so you have micro dreads thin dreads medium average or standard dress and then you have big cuts and extra thick or chunky dreads and those measurements that you saw our estimates they're pretty rough there isn't an exact standard out there that every single dread maker uses in addition to that you'll see in the dread extension community it had a lot of people refer to the size of their dreads using writing tools as measurements the three most common that you see are pencil Sharpie and highlighter which I don't have the pencil Sharpie highlighter system corresponds to the thin standard and thick sizes so I'm one of those people who tend to use writing tools as measurements for example I usually have Sharpie thick dreads but sometimes I have pencil thin and sometimes I have a mix between a sharpie and highlighter like this set and so next up how do you combine these two pieces of information how much hair you have and the size of joints you want and - how many dreads you need before we get started I will disclaimer that I can't really speak on single-ended dreads but what you can do is you can the same calculation for double ended and then double that number usually that will give you more than you need though it just kind of ends up that single ended isn't always double the amount of double ended Reds but it is a pretty safe guess especially if you would rather have a few left over than to run out when you're installing and so unfortunately I don't have any examples of my code Reds to show you but I will have a picture here just let you guys can see what they look like and so for a double-ended micro dreads if you have a full head of hair you might need as many as 80 to 90 or even a hundred just depending on how small they are if you have a mohawk or a half set of hair and four micro dreads a good guess for you would be 50 if you have a side cut maybe is about 75 and so I can't give any really personal experience with my code Reds I'm not super sure in those numbers but I would say if I with my amount of hair were to order micro dreads I would probably order 50 or 60 but a size that I do know a little bit more about is pencil thin or just thin dreads so these are from NME called synthetic dreads and these are from title dreads and I will also disclaimer that when I'm showing you guys the dress you'll see that not all of them are the exact same size and that's because I buy dreads that are handmade machine-made dreads do exist but they are not recommended they're not good quality and while some people do have a good experience with them they tend to fall apart and don't really look as good so if you want thin dreads and you have a full head of hair then a good guess for you would be 70 double ended dreads the range could vary anywhere from sixty to eighty four how many you need just depending on the thickness of your hair or if you have like bangs that you want to leave out if you have a mohawk set like me I order 40 of these minimum if you have a side cut or if you have a thicker mohawk then you might need 50 to 60 next up we're gonna be talking about the sides category that has the most amount of names and so I have dreads here all from Sami synthetics these are my two custom sets from her all of these would be considered sharpie thick standard size average size medium so if you have a full head of hair you usually need about 45 to 50 of these if you have a half set like me I always order 30 of these and of course if you have a lot of your head shaved then you might only need 20 to 25 of these so the next size up is thick dreads or highlighter size dreads and I have a few from my Ella 7 cyber slime set to show you especially this one I think this one is the thickest out of the bunch also in this set that I'm wearing right now like this this green one is a really good example of a thick dread at this thickness and a full head of hair this is where you might only need around 30 to 40 if you're like me and you have a mohawk then at this size you would need about 20 to 25 sometimes I do order 30 still just to be safe because I would very much rather have 5 left over than to be short by 5 and then lastly for the chunky size the extra thick dreads I don't have a full set to show you again but I do have some from the Sami synthetic set that we looked at a little bit ago and so these were braids that she had made to accent the set so if you have a full head of hair and you want a full set at this size and you would probably need about 30 maybe a little bit less if you're like me and you have a mohawk or a half head of hair then you would probably need about 20 maybe a little bit less maybe a little bit more again it all kind of depends and it also depends on how safe you want to be with your ordering like I've been saying throughout the video I always say err on the side of caution and order a little bit more just to be safe as I'm sure you guys gathered throughout the video this is not an exact science at all since everybody's hair is different people have thick hair thin hair medium hair extra thick hair people have Mohawks death Hawk side cuts under cuts bangs no bangs etc what I usually do is my magic number is 30 dreads if I'm ordering Sharpie thick or thicker and I'll get 40 if I'm ordering dreads that are anywhere between pencil thin and Sharpie thick like I said I've never ordered my Co drugs before but if I did I'd probably get at least 50 and if you want more dreads than you might need that's okay as long as you're not over installing you're not putting too much strain on your scope you can install maybe more dreads than you might need to get a very full thick look and so of course if you maybe not wanting something so big and out there then you can order a little bit less than you might need and then just have bigger sections and if you're still not sure after watching this video and figuring out the size the dress that you want and comparing it to how much hair you have then you can always message the maker or the person that you're buying from they'll be able to help you out because they'll know the exact sides of the dreads that you're buying hopefully that all makes sense I'm sorry that it's not an exact science when I can really only give you estimates but that's just kind of how it is I'll also include all of the size categories with their measurement ranges in the description along with where I got all of the dreads that I showed you don't forget that you can follow me on Instagram Twitter Tumblr Facebook you now and I do now have a patreon that you can pledge to and speaking of I'd like to give an extra special shout out to my Phoenix patrons cloud rhythm

of course feel free to subscribe if you're not already thank you so much for watching and I'll talk to you guys later bye", "Qem-s8VDzPQ": "so let's look at 12-8 time hopefully you had a look at the earlier video about 4/4 time and in the 4/4 time I explained that all it refers to is how we divide the bar up so I've got a bar with four beats in it one two three four how do we divide those four beats up in 4/4 time I saying we divide each of them up into multiples of two so are either doing 8 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & or 16 1 e and a 2 e and a 3 E and a 4 E and up in 12 8 you might have already worked this out it means we've got 12 eighth note hits so what that means is each beat is broken up if we're going to divide it by four means we've got four groups of three so we've got 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 and ER that's 12 hits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so we're still feeling a four-bit pulse one and two and three and four and and that's 12 eight that's all it means so again to contrast it two four four four four we're dividing it up into eight or 16 like this 1/10 2/10 3/10 now to move to 12 8 goes like this one run is my right hand as I change is still the same so hopefully that makes sense in the difference between 4 4 and 12 8 and you can hear sort of a qualitative difference between them so one's going to don't-don't-don't no one's going tenten tenten tenten tenten tenten tenten first ones for 4 second ones 12 8", "GB3fh_VtP5U": "to find the least common multiple or LCM of six and eight we begin by listing the first few multiples of each number the multiples we list for 6 are 1 times 6 or 6 2 times 6 or 12 3 times 6 or 18 and 4 times 6 or 24 notice that we skipped 0 times 6 because 0 times 6 is 0 and the least common multiple cannot be 0 next we list the multiples of 8 while listing the multiples of 8 it's helpful to keep one eye on the multiples of 6 so that we know when we found the least common multiple so 1 times 8 is 8 which is not a multiple of 6 so we go on 2 times 8 is 16 which is not a multiple of 6 so we go on 3 times 8 is 24 which is a multiple of 6 so we have found our least common multiple notice that we can stop here because we only want the least common multiple and any other multiples we find for these two numbers will be greater than 24 so the least common multiple or LCM of 6 & 8 is 24", "fuGjv75Qskk": "hey what's up it's Tony I just want to say thanks for putting your name and email in and I'm going to talk to you about some paints and how you can quit get started on a budget or if you want to spend a little bit more money and get into quality paints you can do that too but I don't want to get you all confused and I know it's a little confusing when you're just starting out you don't know what kind of paints to get or where you should even go you know there's a lot of people saying you need this you need that and when you go to paint jumps to try to sell you things that you don't need I was just going to paint shop the other day the newbie came in a military guy he's like oh you know I'm sitting I'm standing here listening to the guy the military guy talked over here with the paint rep paint rips trying to Psalm all kinds of stuff he doesn't even need it I'm over here feeling all bad I'm like trying to interrupt them and go on and say hey you know you really don't need a sealer if you're going to put a nice 2k primer on the car or things like that you know so I I called him outside when he came out I actually waited from a little bit I actually gave them the scoop I said hey you know you really don't need this you need this this this there any problems give me a call he was like so happy and we left off like that but anyway let's get started when you're first starting on your project you're going to need a little bit of primer to go over your body work there is your body filler or your scratches or your glaze putty whatever you're doing we have primer so if you're just starting and you have some metal parts if you stand your car down Camela of a metal area you want to make sure to always use an epoxy primer and etching primer okay we have an epoxy and etching primer right over here this is a little old stuff all right they don't sell Omni anymore so don't worry about the brand we're just talking about the type of primer okay so this is an epoxy primer good for going over metal parts okay it's an epoxy and this we have a canned type alright you can get the self etching this is a self etching it's like an epoxy primer the same thing you just shake it up and you can do little areas of your project with little primer cans like this also okay then we get into our 2k primer which is a high build primer you have to mix your hardener with it it's a four to one mixture so if you buy one gallon of primer you're going to have one quart of hardener to buy you mix it four to one this stuff is usually very very thick so what I like to do is mix it down with some reducer this is the reducer that we use this is a shop-line reducer don't worry about the brands okay because all different brands have different products I'm just showing talking to you about the basic overview of 2k primer your you might need some reducer which I always use reducer because it's just very thick and when you start spraying with this stuff through the gun and it's thick it's going to come out dry you're going to get a rough texture on your car so you want to make sure you mix it up pretty good I usually like to add about 20% of reducer in it you know between 15 to 20 percent just to thin it out a little bit so it lays on nicely so this is your 2k primer it's a high build it fills up so you could have a car sanded priming with this stuff and then you're good to water sound with 4 to 600 wet sand grit 4 to 600 grit this way you have a nice nice finish to put your base coat or any type of paint on top of it all right so this is your primer they say that you need to put sealer on top of this but you don't have to don't let them sell you on sealers and stuff because you don't need it all right we'll talk more about that in depth in the course but for now just want to talk to you about this overview and primers ok so this is also a high build primer you could get a spray can type all right same thing as this same thing but it's in a can and you can do little areas sprayed on do your little coats just like that okay same type of thing now let's talk about base coat clear coat application this is our shop line base coat series okay base coat clear coat means you have your base color okay this is a base coat clear coat chart up here okay you get to pick out a factory color see your car on the street that you like oh man I really like that color on the mm recede ease what color is that you go to the paint shop you tell them look it's a 2000 Mercedes they have a book they open the book up and they could find the exact color that you saw on the street from that car you want to put it on your car they can get you the exact same color coat very easily okay so that's a base coat so a base coat comes in you could buy a gallon size quart size or pint size whatever size you want if you're in the UK or whatever you might be younger on the leader system you get them in litres so this stuff is mixed 50:50 okay so if say if you buy a pint of base coat you're going to mix this 50/50 so you're going to end up with a quart of base coat sprayable so you can have this much to spray if you buy a quart you're going to have a half a gallon to spray pretty simple stuff easy to do the math and we use the same reducer okay to mix this right here same reducer that we use for the 2k primer same reducer we use for the clear coat very easy simple to do it just depends most paint brands are the same the reducers you could use for the primers you could use for the base coats you could use for the roof of the clear coat okay so it's we're using the PPG shop line right here the higher brand of shop line is called your Deltron series Deltron by PPG is like louis vuitton versus uh maybe like a Kmart brand or a Walmart something a cheaper brand versus a Louis Vuitton versus what's a cheap bag like Old Navy versus Gucci or something like that okay so this is just a higher brand of paint compared to your shop line now you're looking at a huge price difference okay so I like to go with the cheap version you're not going to see a difference when you paint the car at all people I've talked to paint reps they says you can't tell the difference at all you're never going to notice so I like to go with the cheap stuff sometimes I get deals I get insider connections I get this stuff pretty cheap but anyway let's talk about clear coat all right so right here we're using the shop line clear coats of polyurethane clear coat all right it's not the best the one better than this is the high build not the high build the high solids my mistake I'm thinking about primer but we have the high solids clear coat okay this is not it but the high solids clear coat has a stronger right I was using this stuff on a very cheap job a couple weeks ago that's why I had some left over but I have some new stuff coming and I'll actually show that to you later on but anyway same reducer like I said this is a four to one mixture okay with our hardener and then reducer we could add in a little bit of reducer if we want usually they say one part so they say four parts it clear one part hardener one part reducer and I like to buy this stuff by the gallon because we use this for everything for our base coat we use it for our clear coat we use it for our prime so it's good to have okay so that's base coat clear coat not an expensive type of paint not very expensive at all for this setup we're looking at about $100 for this clear coat system if we go to Deltron looking at $300 for the best top-of-the-line clear the big difference but again I just talked to the paint rep three days ago I said come on be honest with me can you tell the difference spraying this clear or the Deltron clear the $100 clear versus a $300 clear after it's painted on the panel sanded with mm and buffed out color sanded and buffed can you tell the difference in gloss he said nope you can tell the difference so I told them see you can't tell the difference I never told it I've been painting for since I was 14 13 years old I'm 28 now when you're finished color sanding and buffing with these clear you're not going to even tell okay I just want to put that in your head so you're okay getting the cheap stuff your way okay unless you know you want to get the more expensive stuff it feels better to you inside and yeah I'm sure it's a little bit more durable maybe a hard type of clear coat in the long run maybe it'll last longer but I've had cars painted ten years ago with the same stuff on it still looks good okay so anyway that's our primers our base coats and our clear coats right here now when you're doing base coat clear coat you can mix you can get crazy you could start mixing pearls and flakes in your clear coat okay so these are the types of pearls you can get these are all dry pearls okay there's a house of color very famous brand with pearls good crack this open you could look inside see how the pearl is right there all right very very fine stuff could add my finger and you could just see how fine this stuff up okay you mix this in your clear coat alright you could do any color variation that you want you can get creative and it's very very cool um what I started with when I first started was I would paint maybe like a motorcycle tank white base coat like this we have a white base coat I'd get a motorcycle tank painted white let's say okay let me do all a red pearl so I would mix a little bit of my red pearl very little okay because it really shows up in the more coats that you put on it the darker it gets right so I do a little bit of red pearl paint it let it dry go out in the Sun and look at it it looked really beautiful I was just so happy like wow I did this it came out so nice it's really cool when you start experimenting with different types of pearls and stuff and it's super cool so I really highly recommend you to try pearls and flakes when you talk to you a little bit about flakes over here we have what's called the ultra mini flake because it called the micro sequins it's very very very fine flake okay let me use my other finger here and it will take a look at that flake okay very very fine flake and it's really cool this stuff looks really nice over base coats too so highly recommend to to experiment with this what I usually like to do is say like I'll paint the car red I'll put some red pearl in it and I'll put some flake in it so when you mix the clear coat up you paint the car you're going to have like red pearl and flake it looks really nice I must have painted I would say 25 to 30 cars with this and look how much I have left this if this'll last you your your painting lifetime and this only costed me about $25 it's probably about 35 bucks now about 30 to 35 dollars not for a can and you could get all different types of colors you know we got blue we got Purple Haze Silver's another blues this is the red pearl I was talking about I bought this when I was 13 years old I'm 28 now so this is how long I have this pearl old bahla pearl right here you could actually kind of see how it lays out you could see the color a little bit but this is a bad example but anyway and then they have jumbo flake okay this is the stuff that people go crazy with and they put in lowrider cars and you want to get that super let's use a different finger good see how big you can see how big this rainbow flake is compared to the micro sequence okay so when painting with this type of flake there are a couple of things you want to make sure you don't do and don't worry about it because I'll teach you everything especially with big flake and when you're painting with these types of pearls just wanted to give you a quick overview on everything so you kind of get an idea now like I said you have your base so you spray your base then when you're mixing your clear coat up okay so you have a half a gallon ready mixed ready to paint then you would measure out okay I'm going to put maybe you could measure by weight or by size of a spoon you can go like a one teaspoon full of this stuff or you can go by have a little gram scale and do grams okay all depends on you how you want to do it me I was always doing custom jobs and I never really cared to worry about touch-up to redo it again so I never measured I just put a little bit and mix it up and paint it and look cool but if you're doing a car that you're going to keep you're going to want to make sure you measure out okay for a half a gallon of is clear you know how much curl you put in it so you could mix the same batch again on a smaller scale just divide it down and have the same exact color match just an idea okay so we talked about our base coat clear coat with our pearls now let's talk about the cheaper paints we could get into synthetic enamel and acrylic enamel systems okay this is a shop line it doesn't really tell you anything but this is an acrylic enamel acrylic enamel it's a single stage paint and this is a very cheap okay one gallon of this stuff I only paid about $78 it's a white white is the cheapest paint out there if this was a red it would probably be maybe a hundred bucks 110 dollars or so and I just want to talk to you about the mixture of this stuff really quick um synthetic enamel is a cheaper enamel type of paint okay it's um it's just a cheaper blend of mixtures okay acrylic enamel is supposed to be more durable and a little harder finish not much more costly you just have to pay an extra I think $40 for the catalyst the hardener okay but I'm doing a paint job in a couple days we're going to do a basic synthetic enamel system so there is no harder so make sure that we're going to use with this system is the same reducer believe it or not this reducer is used for basically everything okay so it's very simple you don't have to go get different types of reducers same reducer we're going to be using that mixers our primers our base coats are clear coats we're going to be mixing it for our enamel single stage system okay so this is a four to one mixture also okay so I'm going to be mixing four parts of this to one part of this and we're going to be spraying our car very soon this is a cheap this set right here is about a hundred and ten dollars for everything you could paint a complete full-size car with this no problem have a nice gloss and they also have polyurethane clear coats that you could put on top of this okay so you don't have to put clear on this it comes out very nice and shiny kind of like woman's nail polish if you think about women's nail polish they put on nail polish and you don't have to put clear on it it's already shiny called a single stage paint same thing right here but if you want to give it that extra gloss you can mix up clear and put it on top of it and color sand and buff it just like the base coat clear coat systems I hope I'm not getting you confused here I know if you're new to this you're never heard of these terms before it might be a little throwing you off balance but it's very simple once you know what you're doing and once you pick what type of system you want to follow very easy okay I want to do a synthetic enamel paint this is all you need okay I want to do base coat clear coat this is all you need I'm just showing you a little bit of everything here that's what paint will kind of looks a little cluttered but don't worry about it it's perfectly normal so okay now this is our synthetic enamel so to turn this into an acrylic enamel for that stronger durable paint they're going to sell us a hardener this is not the hardener for it but they're going to sell us a hardener to mix with it so once we mix the hardener with this system it turns it to the acrylic enamel the stronger type of paint okay and it's only like another 30 to 40 dollars more for the hardener okay but this customer didn't want it you just wanted to put a nice quick paint job on it charging them $1,000 for a quick easy cash in my pocket it's a 24-hour job and I get to put some cash in my pocket so just I just want to let you know that to turn it into an acrylic enamel all we do is add a catalyst the hardener without it is a synthetic enamel and it dries perfectly within two hours so you're not going to have a drying problem either way okay if you don't put the hardener in it it's still going to dry it's just different type of blend of paint so that's the that's the overview of the paints over there I hope you kind of got an idea of what you could do and remember you could put pearls and flakes into the base filter code systems or if you wanted to add clear in the synthetic enamel acrylic enamel systems you could mix up your clear put your pearl in it and do the same thing this is just a cheaper paint the base coat clear coat is a new style of pain they've been doing it on the all the new cards for about ten years now at least ten years I think probably more maybe about 14 15 years base coat clear coat is the newer style all the new cards you see now there's a base coat and there's a clear coat on top of it lacquer is very old type of paints after lacquer they came out with the enamel systems like we have right here the urethane systems then we got into the base coat clear coat just giving you a rough over a draft and I hope you enjoyed this presentation and we're going to call it a wrap so I'll see you in the next video", "7wCnKo6-NKQ": "hey guys welcome to motion ranch I uploaded a video previously where I hung a piece of meat in a tree and I shot it with birdshot just to show the effect effectiveness of birdshot and got a lot of flack saying that buck shots better and slugs are better and all this stuff but I never said anything about birdshot being the best home defense option I just said I would feel comfortable and confident having it in my home to fit shotgun today I'm going to test out four different shells and see the effectiveness of each compared to the others the first one is going to be the same as before it's number seven birdshot the second one is going to be a shelf full of double-aught buckshot the third one is a 1 ounce slug and the fourth one is one of these Winchester PD x1 defenders and what they are is a 1 ounce slug followed by three rounds of buckshot these pieces of meat are the same as before they're about four inches thick and again the order is birdshot buckshot slug and then the slug and buckshot combo all right there you go this is birdshot what is in it it made a hole about three inches deep just like last time it tore that meat all apart just a couple pellets you can see trying to come out there in the backside this is buckshot pretty much ripped this thing to shreds definitely penetrated through the other side this is our slug made a nasty hole through didn't even act like it was going to stop going through there and this is our slug and buckshot combo one solid hole all the way through nasty thanks for watching this video I do plan on doing another one with clothing on the meat to see if birdshot can be stopped by jeans or a leather jacket if you have any other suggestions on what you'd like to see don't hesitate to let me know and thanks for watching demolition ranch we'll see you next time", "T9bBmWvAWL8": "If you've ever recorded two people with\nseparate mics for an interview, you might have used one of these to plug your mics\ninto. It's a standard Y-Splitter cable that combines the audio from both mics\nonto one track. But have you ever considered one of these? This is a stereo\nBreakout cable so once you plug this into your H1 it'll split out into two\nchannels, channel 1 and channel 2 or left and right,  giving you a lot more control\nin post. Now you'll see and hear examples of these two cables\nstarting off with the standard Y cable so let's hook that all up. The following clips are recorded with a friend of mine who happened to pass by my house so I just\ngrabbed him. So now you're hearing the audio of a standard Y cable. So tell me Taj, how was your day? Taj:  Yeah really good man. Went out to Luton, big conference talk\n40,000 people...[Taj Interrupted] \nGuys as you can see the audio levels are combined on this Y\ncable which is not what you want. So I'll show you the Hosa Breakout cable now.\nTaj: You don't wanna know about my day then? I'll now connect the Stereo Breakout cable so you can see and hear what that does. So now you're hearing the audio from the Hosa Breakout Cable and as you can see on the H1 my audio is coming on the right side\nand Taj's audio is coming from the left. Sorry Taj I interrupted you, how was your day again? \nTaj: Naaa it's alright,  I just you know was talking about Luton but to be honest I'm pretty hungry. I mean I've been sitting here for ages  man.... [Taj interrupted again] That's all for today guys and join us again next time. Once you've recorded your audio, it's really simple to split them\nout into two channels. By the way I've already synced the audio to the video. To\nsplit the audio in Premiere Pro you can do in two ways. You can either\nright-click or control-click the footage and select Modify > Audio Channels. This\nwill bring up this window. Or the other way is go right to the top menu and\nselect Clip > Modify > Audio Channels. This will bring up the same window as before.\nSo for the preset you select Mono which will change the number of audio clips to\ntwo.  Then press ok to confirm this. Then just add your clip to the timeline. You can see here how I can select Audio 1 or Audio 2 independently. Sorry, he was a hungry guy. \nSo if you want more control of your audio you should\nconsider getting this Breakout Cable by Hosa. \nYou don't need two audio\nrecorders, I recorded using one H1 and two mics and it'll save you carrying\nextra equipment when you don't really need it.\nSo if you enjoyed this video give\nit a thumbs up and subscribe if you want more videos like this and I will see you\nvery soon", "H0qFWA8YJGk": "[Music] okay so we're ready to primer do another primer on the side of the Challenger and the roof of it like I said on the board I have some of my own favorite products and one of them is spectra prime by Sherwin Williams absolutely the best primer on the market and bar none you can pick up a gallon of anybody any competitors primer and weigh it against a gallon of this primer and this is about twice as heavy it doesn't have nearly the talcum powder and it has more building ability as a result it's also very flexible this is the stuff I probably primer all of my classic cars with today I've actually got a pickup med that I need to do a small primer spot on since I'm mixing a framer I'll use this this mixes it a ratio of four to one to one so that means I need to use a mixing Cup that has the ratios predetermined ratios on I like one two one two two one two two point five and one and what I'm looking for is four two one two one so it'll be four parts of primer one part every deucer and one part of hardener so this is one of the mixing cups that I use it has all kinds of different ratios depending on whether I'm doing base coat base coat clear coat whether I'm doing primer whether I'm doing urethane sealers this particular product at four to one to one I'll use this chart right here so I'll bring my product up to the six line on the four then I'll bring it to the six on the one and the six on the one over here that'll give me an even four one to one mixture so I will pour the primer in first always always put your lids back on you don't think you need to well wait till one of these toners falls down in your primer it runs 400 dollar gallon primer so always put your lids on plus it's a safety thing not that I'm into safety but okay so I am at the six mark just above the six mark on the four to one to one ratio so I will go the next one with hardener that'll be two this six mark so I now have four to one I just need to reduce it and there's my four to one to one ratio I have to do a stir on it to mix the products together primer has a very short window I don't usually I try not to push that window of time too much but primer usually after about thirty minutes will start to solidify in your cup once it starts to solidify in your cup it's no longer sprayable and it means you got to take your cup and gun completely apart and clean it out so we try to avoid that so the minute that you're done get your favorite primer gun I just happen to use a cheap $39 throwaway gun that uses a 2.0 tip on it so it's a nice big tip I can really flood the primer on there with this I'm sure you're gonna shoot a straight pattern you're gonna want to strain your products always strain your products you don't want to clump with something getting in the needle or the seat not being able to spray that's a small cup on this one so I'm gonna get my whole mixture in there okay I'm gonna put a mask on you definitely always want to wear a mask when you're painting even if you think you're only going to be in there for a few seconds it's a good idea to do I have other protective gear I would wear if I were doing something cleanliness mattered but it doesn't in this case is if I got dirt or a hair and my primer it'll stand out so let's go primer the challenge", "a8UGOk7RwbI": "hi I'm Shaun yet and this is Minuteman today when I learn about compound inequalities for a solvent in a quality graphics solution so if I was given this inequality mean X plus 8 is greater than equal to negative 64 and then I get a saddle minus ax it's greater than equal to negative 70 not okay well our first step here is on the solve each inequality individually so I'm going to subtract with 8 to both sides here giving me 8x + is greater than or equal to 90 64 - and it comes out to be a negative sent me - okay then I'm going to divide it by 8 to both sides and divide by 8 to both sides X is by itself here is greater than equal to negative 72 divided by 8 is a negative 9 so nowadays solved this one I'm going to add a 7 to both sides by adding a 7 to both sides a must have negative eight X is greater than equal to negative seven nine plus seven is negative 72 and then need to divide by negative 8 to both sides divided by negative each both sides gives me X by itself here this one's in I'm dividing by negative over the inequality that Grandon equals sign turns into a less than or equal to sign so it's less than or equal to there and negative 72 divided by negative is a positive not again our answers has AZ and it's this and that X is greater than or equal to negative 9 and X is less than or equal to none so I'm gonna flip this one over the smaller or a Bentley smaller to one the starts with a negative 9x is greater than that okay I'm gonna flip it where negative x was first and that's less than or equal to X these two statements are the same X is greater than equal to negative 9 negative 9 is less than equal to X but now I can combine it because we said X has to be this and that XSP or negative nice be less than equal X and X has to be less than or equal to none so I can kind of toss this down here giving me less than equal to 9 and there we have I have a compound inequality combining the two parts here that negative 9 is less or equal to X which is less than equal to none so now let's graph it okay let's go back through this three six nine twelve negative three negative six negative 9 negative 12 okay well we started negative 9 and X equal negative 9 so I'm a closed circle right there X cannot equal positive nods I'm gonna put a closed circle right there as well and X can exist everywhere in between so I draw a line between negative 9 a positive line and there we have it we have a graph here that matches our final answer which is negative and it's lesser to X which is less we know it's a positive number so it's pretty cap we're given our two inequalities eight X plus eight is greater than equal negative 64 and at negative seven minus eight X is greater than equal to negative seven not solve each individual yeah that's remedy to both sides here and divide by 8 to both sides give me X is greater than equal to negative nine on this one here I added a certain book slides and then I divided by negative 8 to both sides cause of my inequality to flip and give me X is less than equal to now a positive nine I then combined that to here I've flipped the negative nine so X is greater than or equal to negative nine but negative nine first so I have negative nine is now less than or equal to ax was those mean the same things brought down this part here but it's less or equal to none so now I have negative nine it's less than equal to X which is less than equal to a positive nine by graphing it I have a closed circle at negative nine and a positive because X could equal both of them and X is in between lies in between them I have my line here in between them so now my graph here matches my final answer which is negative 9 is less or equal to X which is less than equal to a positive", "X8ILeEHGtKc": "all right so we're out here in my small engine shop and I thought I'd make a video showing you guys how to make two-stroke fuel now I have done a video like this in the past but it had been deleted so I thought I didn't make the video and do a bit of more in-depth procedure so here's where I store my two cycle oil got Castrol maker state these are all conventional oils then we got all the synthetic oils and I'm guessing this is synthetic it doesn't say but it is ash less which most synthetic oils are this is actually Briggs & Stratton oil I came across this today and I picked up two bottles of it the last two that they had reason being is this oil is rare they do not make this oil anymore because Briggs & Stratton does not have any two cycle engines on the market anymore behind that it's just some echo power blend you never can have enough of this stuff it's bit of oil it's great for chainsaws and weed eater stuff like that but what I use in my equipment is AMSOIL saber professional and that's what I'll be using today so I'm going to be cracking open a new bottle I just finished my last bottle one of these usually lasts me like half a year I only use this for my equipment for my dirt bikes and other pieces of machinery like that I use a 5 liter jug to suck oil but we'll crack this open now the key thing when using 2 cycle oil is measuring the proper amount of oil what I use is this little scoop here it came with a can of protein and this is 2 ounces you can also use a shop gloss but one out shot glass that will work as well before we do anything with the oil you're going to want to fill up a little gas can like this or you can do a larger gas camp I'm going to be doing one gallon of 2 you'll feel as this is only for my handheld and I have one mower that runs on a two cycle feel but it does not get used very often so what you want to do is you want to fill up the gas hand pathway with fresh ethanol free if you can gasoline how-use 91 octane ethanol free and the reason why I want to use ethanol free is because ethanol is not good for two cycle engines with four cycles you can get away with it a bit but still it's not good at all for most small engines especially to do cycles because ethanol is dry and it cut makes the two cycle oil lose its lubricity so we're at the halfway mark here so we're going to be making one gallon of fifty to one you can go out and purchase a small bottle like this but chances are you will have a bottle somewhat of this size what you want to do is you're going to want to pour the oil into your measurement cup and basically for one gallon of fifty to one is 2.6 ounces so I'm going to fill this container up all the way and then a little bit over half I'll just pour it into your gas tank so that was 2 ounces now I'm going to fill up to the halfway mark now that you've got the two cycle oil into the gas tank you're going to want to put your spout back in and put the cover on to the spout put the cap on and shake it now what we're going to do is I have the remainder of the gasoline sorry so we're now at the 1 gallon mark once again we'll install the spout and give it another good shake and that's all there is to it now you've got the fuel mixed you can go put the fuel into your piece of equipment and you'll be able to run it knowing that the engine is going to be safe anyways this was another video by Tim offense thanks for watching if you have any questions on mixing two cycle fuel or any other ratios please send me a PM or a comment in this video thanks for watching take these best", "e-JRkZwuLAs": "while Shimano and Campagnolo chains are traditionally fitted with the connecting pin more and more chains are now connected with a small link known as a quick link master link or spare link this little item replaces the outer plates of a single link of chain and creates a reliable connection with the slotted joint older eight and nine speed links with tool free and simple to use but thinner 10 11 and even 12 speed links have complicated this these newer links are much tighter to close and typically aren't designed for easy removal here I'll show you the basics in using new quick links to install a quick link you need to start with the chain of the correct length you'll need to ensure each posing end has matching open inner links if there is a wider plate use a chain breaker to remove this link the master link will go in its place some links such as Shimano's new SMC n900 a directional the arrows stands on the link should point in the direction of the chains travel when connecting below the chain stay this points toward the rear of the bike put the links into the opposing ends of the chain and bring them together link them together using the large slotted holes to join correctly the goal is to pull the link apart so that it locks into the smaller section of the slot using a closing tools such as Shimano's TLC n10 orbic AMC missing link closing tool is by far the easiest way to do this especially with Shimano's new links which are extremely tight to close if you don't have a tool then pedal the chain so that the quick link sits above the chain stay you'll now use force through the pedal to pull the link closed hold the rear wheel and push down on the pedal a pop will tell you the link is closed as well a visual inspection if the link is super tight so close put the bike on the ground hold the rear brake firm and push down on the pedal with your foot again a way to pop to tell you the link is installed any link that requires force to close will require a tool to open master link choirs perform this exact task and even the cheapest ones will do the job there are also portable versions of these tools from clever standard and wolf 2 components both work but neither ideal for regular use the clever standard is made of plastic while the Wolf's tooth lacks comfort and leverage for the tightest links it works but it's not an enjoyable experience if you don't have the tool then a pair of needlenose pliers can be used diagonally across the link this will likely damage the link so only do it if you're planning on throwing away the link another method suggested elsewhere is to use a rope or accessory cord to pull the link together this may work on looser fitting links but it'll cut your hands up on something's height like a Shimano link it's not a method I would suggest the one exception to all of this is whip amends connects links this is a reusable link that hooks together with a special shape as opposed to a locking fit which also means it's tool free to install and remove for more information on

beyond Texas City coming to you with another unboxing video we've got the aragorn eights for you guys this is part of these cigar and champagne pack this colorway is actually the black metallic gold an anthracite colorway I wanna show you guys a little bit of the box first as you can see you got the Roman numeral eight at the top of the box the yin and yang type of concept on the top of the box to represent the cigar and champagne and it's kind of like a drawer type of box but the lid kind of lifts at the top and right off the bat when you open up the sticker you get this paper with the Roman numeral eight across the entire paper the shoes obviously are really dull but I want to just highlight a few extra details that come with the shoes so first and foremost as you can see you've got the hang tag the Air Jordan eight on one end of the shoe and on the other you kind of have like this little joke I'm Jordan included which is confetti in order to celebrate the third cigar a champagne pack and a little extra on the inside of the shoe yeah a little bit of I'm sorry on the inside of the box we have like this cork bottom with the rolling numeral eight so really cool details overall on the shoe in my opinion it's a great pack and as the third installment of the cigar I'm paying pack I definitely think that they went all out so this is the black and gold pair so in 2014 Jordan Brand unveiled a pack called the cigar and champagne starting with the Air Jordan six and then they went on on 2015 with the Air Jordan seven and this year to represent the three-peat that Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls did in 1993 they wanted to honor that moment with the Air Jordan 8 which was the shoe of choice during that time so let's start by reviewing the outsole real quick we'll get into the details a little bit later as you can see you've got your regular air drew 1/8 bottom jump man at the front and you got that confetti on the middle right there as a graphic midsole of the shoe is a combination of anthracite and black you have that confetti on that graphic on the mudguard if you may on the inside of the shoe as well as on the inside you have this little hangtag that comes with the airborne eight that says official and certified authentic and classic celebration here with Jumpman logo right there cool the addition the upper part of the shoe features a nice tumble leather material in black and you also have a patent leather that kind of has a confetti like design on the background of that patent leather so once again very minimal in terms of colorways but the details on these are very very crisp perforations on the inside leather right there obviously with the Air Jordan 8 you got that cross strap design in 223 and you also have at the top of the shoe that patent leather on the eyelid that continues on the heel of the shoe as well as on the strap one of my favorite things about the shoes on the inside of the strap we have these little sayings on one it says world champions as you can see and on the other one it says again and again right there so that's a cool little addition the shoes come with your regular wax laces and you've got the Jumpman embroidery at the top shinee packs right at the top this time around they did like a gold foil type of metallic jump man with the embroideries around it nice leather pebbled top also have the lining on the inside of the shoe with the confetti as well and you got that jump back on the insole of the shoe for more information on how to purchase these shoes and for more information on our

of this video everything we're going to use a 12-gauge but that's the most common for a fighting shotgun and we're not talking about hunting or anything like that we're talking about a fighting shotgun it they're very popular we've done recent reviews on the kel-tec KSG and the Mossberg 930 SPX the ribbons and versal max all good shotguns they all work very well I don't have my KSG now the local sheriff's department of Bart and try it out see if they like it so they got it but we're going to be using the Versa max today for the shooting we're going to be doing now we're going to talk a little bit about stopping power of a shotgun because I've had so many people I recommend if overpenetration might be a problem you live an apartment builder and something like that to use a birdshot for defense well I've had people saying that bird shot is useless it spreads too fast which in truth they don't spread any fashion the buckshot they both spread the same rate we're going to prove that to you today they've also said that it will penetrate one guy said it wouldn't penetrate a pizza box I don't know where he lives what they're making pizza boxes out of them maybe cast iron I don't know around here the cardboard and about anything blow right through it but any one had a lot of stuff like that a lot of myths out there people said that uh birdshot don't do any good in ballistic jail on the own body made out of ballistic gel some kind of simulation thing it wouldn't do any good I know nobody's made of a simulated computer type stuff we're going to shoot some meat today to show that it will penetrate we're gonna shoot me gonna shoot bonk we're gonna talk about various things letting down Herman bunker on top of some of these loans one of the best combo Lopes is so that I like is this Winchester PD x1 and we did you get up a one-out slug and on top of that you get three double-aught buckshot plated buckshot and white patterns on target you always get the slug in the middle and the free buckshot or a circle around it watch satellite so if you don't know if you want buckshot or slug combo that you got both at the same time you got that now well also got a good buckshot long here this is the federal nine pellet to 3/4 buckshot Lotus the most common what most people uses you can go to three inch and get a twelve pellet you can go to three and a half inch they've got an eighteen pellet now most people use a two and three-quarter because you got the 933 caliber buckshot they do a good job now we'll talk a little bit about the birdshot if over penetration might be a problem if you afraid something might go fill the wall and kill your neighbor sometimes where I live you know sometimes got grandkids down the hall or something and I use in my personal shotgun I keep by the bed is loaded with birdshot this is the remington st s load it's a a target load it's announcing an eighth of shot and that at a typical cross room justices that alps and on eighth which is so in this size shot is a little over four hundred pellets hits in one cluster and it's all about five hundred grams or better of weight and it's gonna hit the cluster and do a good job a lot of people don't believe that so we're going to set out to prove that today and we'll talk a little bit about chuck sizes bug zoom over here on the board a little bit sometimes we was talking about now that this is a this is to scale but it's not actual actual pellet I see we've got here now lock up for your up buckshot number forward is a good load and the FBI use care that I don't know if it's still her or not but number four you get more pellets you get in a two and three-quarter inch shell you'll get thirty four pellets of number four which is about twenty four caliber as opposed to uh nine pellets of the double hawk number four is pretty devastating if maximum penetration what you need then go for the bigger shot or slug but it's not number four is a good combination which one the small sizes of the birdshot and the larger thirty-three caliber double up number four notches has twenty-four calibers thirty four of them in the 3-inch shell you get forty one of those so that's a lot of shotgun out there it's more weight because the way they load into the shell you can get more them in there plus you got a lot more hits anyways just that's real good choices and you can go anywhere in between you know you don't have to choose either double out or either birdshot like say you can get the number for both or you can get some larger birdshot like for hunting turkey logan stuff like number two shot BB number four things like get the penetrate really well but anyway it's just there's a lot of choices in shotgun ammo and in close range there's nothing more devastating that we can legally own than a shotgun for fighting you know one of the myths that has come up in the topics here lightly is the birdshot sprigs too quickly and that's false they don't spread any any quicker than does a buckshot and we're standing here a typical across the room nice big room but 21 to 25 feet your bedroom you know could be about half that but we're gonna show that it don't spread out and you'll people have said that you either spread so much on get two or three pellets in the target that's crazy so we're gonna shoot a little we've got a remington out tonight sts here a number eight shot we're gonna shoot that first and then we're gonna follow it with a nine pellet buckshot load double-aught buckshot we're going to impact the target the first shot will be the birdshot the second shot will be the buckshot now as you can see here at that distance they both got about the same sprint you get a few few pellets out here on the birdshot but the main want of them and this is an open border it's not any constriction at all to this choke the right they're clustered in the middle now we're going to talk about the penetration a little bit a lot of people says that it won't penetrate anything as we talk to about just a few minutes ago we're gonna shoot some meat now let's go down here boat okay I've got some meat here in this sack and what I did I wanted to have bone in it just like a rib cage I've got a rack of ribs in there pork ribs and behind it a pork shoulder now I couldn't you know didn't have any extra cadavers laying around I'm fresh out of them so porks the closest thing with the use of this these ribs right about a 250 pound hog so they're good solid ribs just like rib cage I've got here and right under the rib cage and the human being is soft tissues real soft like lungs and heart and stuff it's not gonna be as tough as this pork shoulder we're gonna shoot the pork shoulder anyway I've got denim arete wrapped around it so it's like if you had only shirt or something your rib tags right under and then the pork shoulder behind you now a lot of people have you believe that's just gonna bounce off and do no harm I've got it all hanging here and onions that how many people were on the insect but that will hold it for me while I shoot this we're gonna show the penetration let me go through this denim this heavy weight blue jean denim through the bones and rib cage into the pork shoulder we're gonna shoot it with a Remington target load outs in the eighth of shot I'm backed off here again about 21 feet from the target which is a lycra cross the living room or something again your bedroom you're going to be about half that close now if you're out at 40 50 yards true the birdshot is not what you want more talking about inside of dwelling so I breaks into your house in your home you don't want anything to over penetrate him and go through walls and kill somebody you don't want to accidentally miss shot oh the birdshot will penetrate walls so don't think that it's gonna bounce off walls and go through the walls but once it does those pellets lose steam quickly and they're not going to go through three walls and kill somebody but they are effective on mate now you can see the surface one right here it blows this Dental apart and see the hole down to the meat we're going to cut it off that goes against everything I believe in the room $25 worth of good pork which are cementing goobersmooches out there that hadn't tried this but they keep repeating myths that merge Chuck's no good for a defense and it's just crazy it makes holes in meat and makes holes in flesh and bones we're going to show you this yeah here's the wreck of ribs then you see a few pellets dispersed around here but most of them are there in the middle there's the shotgun wad to come on it there's the rib bones dogs won't eat good tonight I guess and then here we'll get down into the meat we're going down and our good good four inches down into that mate and it also hit the shoulder bone down in here chewed up at shoulder bony bust it up pretty bad deflected there's bone fragments all down in there and keep in mind just what's behind the rib cage inhuman it's not this soft how many exhauster than this tissue this is a didn't over penetrate back here but a win any good four inches down into the meat now busted that boney and besides going through the media busted that shoulder bone wide open there it's devastating if I hit heart and lung and stuff like that after going through the rib cage it tears up a lot of stuff in there then you can see it right here now if you don't believe it there it is you don't have to use a bird shot I use bird shot inside the house it's what I like it's the best thing to use and that's what we got here so anyway we showed it here we're in some really good meat and we did it to prove the bird shot is effective they don't spread any further than buckshot it penetrates well in flesh goes through bone still penetrates well well through the demo one through the onion sack if you if somebody comes in there wearing a pizza box I don't know what you come to mind I go through the cardboard pizza box like one guy said but but that's just crazy myths that people repeat without training that's not ballistic jail it's not a simulator it's actual meat and and it works so anyway there it is we well we've proved what I set out to prove day because I knew it would work I've done it before I've shot in the meat before but I wanted to show everybody to maybe convince some of the non-believers out there that it will work and it doesn't over spread it doesn't over penetrate but it will penetrate far enough to do the damage you need done does a good job on this and we should run some good pork show [Music]", "sdY7nC4bFKc": "oh yeah and it's Priscilla bat-cillin Spring Hill Florida at Express New Starts to do a gallery in the backyard and it's kind of a warm February day in Florida I have in front of me some art ezza I think it's our teza 60 back of color fluid acrylics nice selection of colors just sent to me by our teza you will slowly remove the top yes we don't need it for now I'll check out the colors the cruise to me and I have some arts has the colors already mixed up from the last time they sent me some but in any case I know what I like and so I'm gonna be searching for what I like and so far I'm gonna grab that green that's number you know 109 that could get old pretty quick I have some greens what I'm really after are these uh these fuchsias but it's not future what's it called it's called magenta light that's 146 and you can't see those and that is rose rose matter when it's watercolor is awesome what a beautiful color that is I have a whole lot of Gray's in the bottom none of which I'm gonna use I have a lot of Browns in the bottom I'm probably not gonna use I got some great purples I will definitely use those reds can stay out I think those greens I have some yellow do I want more yellow okay I'll leave some yellow out too this is not the most organized process I'll leave this out too because I like that color and I'm not sure I have that color that color being sky blue top but an original name anyway names shouldn't be original for colors there should be something you recognize and that's obviously a custom color although I do tend to make that color quite frequently emerald green phthalo green Viridian green Prussian green Prussian green seriously cool I didn't see any pressure glue but that doesn't mean it's not there there's the Prussian blue I'll be having some of that I can tell you so one two three four Ultima in do I need that since I don't have any of that out right now I guess I'll just go for the cobalt so I have almost as many tubes of paint as I have containers to put it in and I'm just gonna keep grabbing colors that I like we know what colors I like and they include lots of purple and let's grab a yellow and chances are I'm not gonna get to use all these also we will probably come back for part two if I get these mixed enough to do something with I want to refocus on that this is a set of 14 canvas panels from our teza 12 by 16 inches I'm gonna move that out of there in a minute first I'm gonna refocus don't ask me why maybe I'll just put those down there then I'll refocus this is costing our teza art supplies and me time and other ingredients and so I thought I would share with you [Applause] unfortunately for those of you who don't want to see paint being mixed this would be a good time to quit and this beautiful neon pink will be my first victim you know what I have - wow that's a real neon pink super I got to get my gak 800 by golden [Applause] into anything without my caffeine hundred so that's the deal here goes what I'm assuming is okay let's just call it a squirt cuz that's not a whole lot of paint down there it could be more than ten percent gap for sure I think I'm just gonna try and use maybe half this tube okay three quarters of the tube with who's counting and I got to get myself one of those tube squeezers but um this is a good experiment for finding out what colors I like that is a really vibrant pink neon pink okay so I'm gonna give that marble in the bottom and that paint a little bit of a shake this is my deco art pouring medium from Hobby Lobby with half floral mixed in which I have screened this time so there's my paint color in the bottom and there's my estimated estimated amount of floral deco for you I don't like the way it looks I will add the rest of that neon pink because I like Gina DeLuca I like my colors to be about maybe a little bit more floral and decora pouring medium let's see that doesn't look too bad I think that might cover I'm still inclined to use the rest of that paint but I'm not going to do it just because right now I have an agenda and what goes better with pink Dan violet yes violet and the same thing again I could squeeze and there is something in the bottom of my bottle what is that something oh you know why I hallucinate it that was the green marble no wonder it looked green it was so here goes the same gig all over again squeeze that paint right in there you notice how long that took me I mean it took forever to get that paint mixed in it that's why I like the squeeze bottles I don't have a whole lot of paint because these tubes are not very large but they do have larger size packages of paint this is from the last set sent me they just unfortunately have not shown me where I can purchase the bright colors that I happen to be a big fan of maybe they'll be there someday I would advise looking for them I think that there will be probably a 10% off coupon involved which is what they told me would be involved when I'm gonna take a guess again and this is looking like a very nice saturated color whatever I get I'll try and make a painting of with with that looks that looks pretty sheer honestly looks um let's grab a little something something we can put some color out on just to check you know I think that'll work but what I really want to make sure is that it works well so I am going to go ahead whoops that's not what I had in mind I'd like to put my tops upside down in a container that way they don't fill all of the threads yep I'm just gonna use all that purple cuz you know me I will be using all that purple it's not called neon but it's pretty bright I really like it I'm gonna try and squeeze some of that paint down from the ends of a tube like I said I need a tube squeezer and I want to be careful not to waste anything oh really okay that was less than I thought it was gonna be but he didn't land on my shirt okay so we have more of that and I know there's enough gatok 800 by Golden in there so I'm not gonna worry about that right now I'm gonna hold my finger over the top shake my marble check my color which looks a little darker and oh you know what I'm just gonna go go with the flow pun intended so I've got two down and a bunch more to go whatever goes best with that pink and that purple will be why don't I just grab what I want what I really want is the Prussian blue it looks like my overly generous nature with the GAC 800 the golden is causing me some issues because I'm gonna run out of what I had in my bottle before long these are quite large bottles but they're the smallest bottles I could find that would still fit a marble so I'm going to slightly mix my deck 800 with my art ezza Prussian blue and see if I can aim well I am estimating as long as the color looks good to me I'm happy with it [Applause] I like the cling-wrap it does cover things fairly well I think that'll work well it's a little it's a little run here but there's really good color saturation in the Prussian blue always and I probably don't need to talk let's be moving on I think I want some lighter purple which is called mauve pale that's a pretty color that is almost like my neon purple all right well no matter what amount is - 800 by Colden there is in that container it's at least 10% well let's pretend it is I think it is it's definitely 10% [Applause] and I'm going to try and empty that tube right out because there's no use in thinking I'm going to come back later for a little tiny teeny insignificant amount of paint I do tend to use the edge of the table to run my squeezed out to Bob so that I forced the rest of the paint to the end where I want to squeeze out the residual I am just that much a quarter Scottish and happy about it too that's probably more than I expected it to be this color was not available to me the last time in the larger package but um like I said I hope they do and I hope that that has enough color saturation that would be fully in my opinion probably 3/4 floral Decca recording medium Jack gold an 800 combination and that looks color saturated so this is that beautiful yes magenta light which we all know is one of my favorites and I need more golden [Applause] this is how I buy that because I can which is the name of my book on my amazon link always below the video so [Applause] where is my label and that looks like a goodly amount I'm gonna fill up my other bottle in a second this is probably my favorite color in the bunch this is the color I really wanted right out of the gate from the start saying the difference I feel like I'm just making noise this is not a video for people who don't like to watch paint being mixed I would not be watching this video but there will come a moment when I will add the iridescent find pearl when I will add that in and we will have a look and see what samples of that look like also but I'm gonna keep putting the tops back hide these little bottles cuz I know I can take the tip of a bamboo skewer and rim it around in there and probably get some more color out even though I said I wouldn't you know I will I am just that way now I'd like to say that that is only probably right up to the bottom there but I can't actually see down in there so I'm gonna have to guess it guesstimate it but the same as the rest just like I used a lot but I did the same thing with the artis of the last time I made videos oh that was the right color cap and all let's take that old dried off paint off there I think that will work fine I'm gonna put a little more gaki entered into my bottle so I don't have to hoist the gallon sized container really would like to just make a painting but that's coming I think what if I got I've got two more bottles left in a small bottle and I think that this let's see what this orange looks like say no I have some red I have a choice between orange yellow and the orange red well I'm kind of like both of those thank God it's not the same color it is on the package because I'm not sure I'd be thrilled with that you guys need to get your colors right I think whoa good catch all right so that's yeah that's what I expect from that color that's a good color orange which I will probably use all of and squeeze it out [Applause] a little bit a bit of a stir with a marble in the bottom I wonder what the yellow is gonna look like probably very similar I could probably risk putting that in a smaller container although there's some residual paint in there and I'm not so sure that's gonna make me happy so let's just give this some more of the half and a half deck or pouring medium flow at all unfortunately color saturation is important to me but fortunately orange is usually very strong this is all gonna be a very very much of an experiment and I will use some of these colors without adding a shimmer effect to them but I'm not promising that's not the next step because I think that's gonna happen so I'm just gonna do the yellow so I have nearly got a rainbow see how much is there I think a little more let's see what color we've got oh that's a good color that is that color if you can see it it's got a little touch of orange in it that's some I think when it's my golden it's called Gary lid although that might be a little more orange than that I finally figured out that's the colored butter used to be in the old days when the milkman delivered it that's the dairy lid probably milk lid would be confusing [Applause] I remember ah really right on my finger okay fine what do I remember I remember that milk bottles when I was a kid had foil tops [Applause] all right that's about as much as I'm gonna get out of there until I want to make a concerted effort I'm assuming that everything in that tip will I got two minutes left for 20 minutes a 20 minute video about somebody mixing paint holy cow well I guess for those of you who don't mind the sound of my voice thanks for the company and for those of you who are waiting for a video it's coming soon I'm gonna grab my black and my white and any of the other artistic colors that I already have the next and the last time I use Artesia and let's take one more test here you really want some of that blue whoa I want some of that blue but I'm not sure color we have here we have rose I did not use that oh that's perfect that's a beautiful color so these are the colors I'm gonna want I [Applause] find a few more bottles to spare or clean a few more bottles get most of the residual out so in the meantime check the last 20 seconds of this video if you're still here if you want to find my playlists with actual artworks on it there's about 450 of them and you can find a link to my website there also and I am getting ready to go look for some other paint and open up why don't we just open up that on a pack of canvases right now sometimes it's just fun to open stuff I gotta say that canvas boards are not my first choice they're not my go-to thing because I feel like they warp from the moisture in paint pouring but I don't suppose if they do work I will be leaping to use them for paint pouring for very long and I'll just use my own canvases but it's a good experiment and we will be making it this is Priscilla bad selling Spring Hill Florida studio gallery saying we have mixed some art ezza paints we are going to make a piece of art it's time for me to go and I'll be back soon check out my book on the amazon link where you can find other

that's part of these cigars champagne pack so this is actually the light bond and metallic gold white colorway that we're going to be doing a review on just want to show you guys a little bit of the details on the box as you can see Roman numeral eights at the top of the box right there the goal you got like this me and yang effect with the box to represent the cigar champagne yeah throw our like box but the lid kind of flips open almost like the Jordan five right off the bat when you open the box you got this papers with the Roman numerals at the top there this is pretty cool and there's also some key details to notice when you get the shoes you got this little hangtag like a certification hangtag and also comes with a little bit of confetti in this Jordan bag right here Holly the celebration of the three-peat and inside of the box you have like a cork finishing as a flooring of the box along with the Roman numeral eight right there so from the box and the details on the box is pretty cool just wanted to show you guys that real quick before we get into the shoes so when they first introduced these the cigar champagne pack was in 2014 and they used the air drone six silhouette which was the shoe that Michael wore during his first championship from the three-peat then they went on to the seven and then they went on to the eight which is this right over here to complete the three-peat which was the shoe that he was wearing at the time there's two colorways one of them is the black and this one is the light bone colorway that we're going to be doing a review on if you guys want to check out the one you could definitely do that right after this video what I love about this particular pair is the fingerprints on the little gold part right there on the mud guard it's kind of like the fingerprints that you'd get when you can hold that championship and then the fingerprints are like stuck into the to that metal or that trophy same concept here so one of my favorite parts of the shoe and overall the colorway in my opinion is the one of the better ones the strongest ones from the Air Jordan eights that released in the past year so definitely a dope color with that light bone and gold good good color combination so let's start by reviewing the outsole real quick you got the air-drawn eight outsole and what i love about this is you got a little like speckling of that gold glitter a little bit of that icy effect going on and we're in the middle part right over here where you have the graphic you have the fingerprints then the same type of color white gold jump man obviously at the front right there Regular Air Jordan eight midsole and that light bone with a little bit of that icy effect mud guard you do have that gold finish on the mud guard right there which is and also those fingerprints and on the inside of your shoe as well the upper part of the shoe is like a suede like material and you also have like this pearled leather that's going along the eyelets and on the heel of the shoe right there like I mentioned earlier the shoe comes with this little hangtag right here that says official and certified authentic and classic celebration gear with the Jumpman logo right there one of my favorite parts of the shoe is the details obviously but sometimes when you got to look and find these details on the inside of the strap it says world champions right there and on the other side it says again and again to represent the three-peat that's a pretty cool little detail there obviously with the Eric tour dates you have that cross strap design above the laces laces come in that like bone wax lace and you have this Jumpman logo at the top right over here and then gold metallic colorway with Rory around there and finally on the inside got like a gold insole with the fingerprints on there for more information on how to purchase these shoes and for more information on our locations in the Montreal and Toronto

that myself it's not our fault we're ah truff you'll keep feeding us bad mixes you keep this up and you're gonna ruin me before my time just like them you're under warranty if there's a problem well Sears will fix it not so fast Bob problems caused by using the wrong mix aren't covered by the warranty no I didn't know that well what am I supposed to do well first off use good quality craftsmen to cycle engine oil it has the proper ratings so it won't cause damage to your product no sorry and always make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions for the correct fuel oil mix guessing the ratio is a recipe for disaster gotcha and using fresh fuel is always the best idea if you've had fuel for longer than 30 days replace it check you will find that following these simple steps will help keep your two cycle tools from running rough and keep them in top shape for a long time it's good advice Bob use it if only he'd learned this lesson earlier you still be with us mr. chainsaw Oh y-you went before your time dad thought we were supposed to be working on Milan together oh I was just reading up on the on the fuel requirements for this did you know you have to mix oil with the gas

How can you use the three\nand five gallon containers to measure exactly four gallons of water? So if we've already thought\nabout this question, let's go ahead and talk\nabout one possible solution. Step one, we would fill up\nthe three gallon container, and then we're going to\npour these three gallons into the five gallon container. That'll give us three gallons\nin the five gallon container. Next, we're going to fill up the three gallon container again, and now we're going to fill\nup the five gallon container, because there's already three gallons in the five gallon container, notice how only two more gallons will fit in the five gallon container. So if we fill up the\nfive gallon container, that would leave one gallon\nin the three gallon container. So we're going to pour out\ntwo of the three gallons in the three gallon container, which would fill up the\nfive gallon container. Okay, we just poured in\ntwo additional gallons into the five gallon container, leaving us with one gallon in\nthe three gallon container. The next step, we're going to empty the five gallon container, and now we'll pour the one gallon in the three gallon container into the five gallon container. So if we pour this water into\nthe five gallon container, again we'll have one gallon\nin the five gallon container, so this water will be gone, and we now have one gallon\nin the five gallon container. Next, we're going to fill up the three gallon container again, and now we're going to pour this water into the five gallon container, which already has one gallon in it, one gallon plus three gallons would give us exactly\nfour gallons of water, which is what we need. So we'll empty these three gallons into the five gallon container, which gives us the four\ngallons of water we need, only using a three gallon\nand five gallon container. I hope you found this helpful.", "1-pCMxchcUw": "[MUSIC PLAYING]", "qNWEUtOeJYI": "now let us move on to the second build in the question so in the second bit we need to solve for plus seven bit so as we know that for addition of any two fractions or a number in the fraction we need to obtain a common denominator therefore the given expression is written as 4 by 1 plus 7 by 8 here we need to find the LCM for the denominators one in eight since the numbers 1 & 8 do not have any other common factor other than 1 the LCM of 1 comma 8 is equal to 1 times 8 which is 8 so now we shall find the equivalent fractions for 4 by 1 and 7 by 8 so to obtain the common denominator 8 4 by 1 is multiplied with 8 on both the numerator and denominator so we obtain 4 times 8 is 32 divided by 1 times 8 is 8 and the equivalent fraction for 7 by 8 is 7 by 8 itself since it has a denominator 8 which is the else iam so now the expression for plus 7 by 8 is written as 32 by 8 plus 1 by 8 since both the fractions have common denominators we can directly add the numerators so the common denominator 8 remains as it is and in the numerator we add 32 and 7 so 32 plus 7 gives 39 therefore the solution for the expression 4 plus and where it is 39 by 8", "Hq5JIjWeTGc": "a fruit basket contain four oranges five apples and the six mangoes the number of who is a person make a selection of fruits from among

everyone this is Justin from amplified parts today we're going to show you how to wire up a 212 speaker cabinet in both series and parallel configurations this is handy when you're building the new speaker cabinet and you've got to match the impedance of your amplifier to the speaker cabinet itself so we need to the point of speaker selection for your speaker cabinet you're going to want to make sure that you match the amplifiers output impedance up to the cabinet itself just because this helps with overall performance of the speaker's working together with the amp and also it prevents output transformer damage if you have such a bad mismatch so we've got our 212 speaker cabinet that's loaded up with two jensen electric lightnings at 8 ohms we're also going to be using these little harnesses that I made up using our number twenty cloth-covered wire and our switch craft mono jacks I also threw some steak on Spade connectors whatever you want to call them on the end just for the ease of you take them off put them back on again if I were going to make this more permanent I would probably just solder the connections so we have our speakers mounted in this cab with the terminals up that's mostly just for the ease of showing you how to do this you can mount them with terminals down whichever way you prefer works alright so what we're going to do is we're going to wire up the two 12 cabinet first in series now this should give you with two 8 ohm speakers a 16 ohm load we'll start by putting a single wire from the negative terminal to the positive terminal of the other speaker so this is your first connection your second connection is going to be the harness that has the jack on the end of it you're basically just going to hook the negative wire up to the negative terminal on this speaker and then you're going to hook the positive wire up to the positive terminal on this speaker and there you have it next we'll show you how to wire your cabinet up in parallel so we're going to use this twisted pair of wires to connect your positive and negative terminals on each speaker to each other first so once you have disconnected this connects the two speakers you're just going to run the other wiring harness twisted pair from the mono jack - this speakers positive and negative terminals respectively and there you have it this wiring should give you at with two eight ohm speakers a four ohm load so that's about it we showed you how to wire up your to 12 speaker cabinet in both series and parallel configurations you'll see from the diagrams that we flashed up on the screen that you have a few different options in terms of impedance based on the impedance of your speakers and how you choose to wire them up be sure to subscribe to our channel because next week we'll have another video and you can also visit us at amplified parts comm and check out our tech corner articles on speakers and speaker wiring you can also find us on Facebook Twitter and

contains carbon and hydrogen and oxygen is combusted and it gives 14 point two grams of carbon dioxide at seven point two nine grams of water we want its empirical formula now if you know anything of a combustion analysis you know that this number will give the number of moles of carbon and this will give the number of moles of hydrogen what we don't know is the number of moles of oxygen but we can find that two because we were given the original mass let's do this together the number of moles of carbon is the same as the number of moles of carbon dioxide because there's only one carbon atom in each carbon dioxide so to figure out that number of moles it's fourteen point two grams the mass divided by the molar mass of carbon dioxide forty four point oh one Rams per mole that's fourteen point two divided by forty four point O one that's 0.32 to seven moles of carbon dioxide and again because there's only one carbon in each carbon dioxide it's the same number of moles for just carbon how about for hydrogen well we have seven point two nine grams of water and water itself weighs or has a molar mass of eighteen point O two grams per mole that's this many moles of water but because we have two hydrogen's per water we need to double that in order to get the number of moles of hydrogen so what I have is zero point eight zero nine one moles of hydrogen what we need now is the number of moles of oxygen because an empirical formula is based off the relative ratios of all the atoms with each other this is where the magic comes in this many moles of carbon weighs how much well the mass is equal to the number of moles 0.32 to 7 times the molar mass of just carbon because again we're only caring about just carbon here this is in grams per mole I guess I forgot that here so 0.32 - 7 divided up damn times 12 point o 1 means that that many moles of carbon has a mass of 3 point 8 7 6 grams we can do the same for hydrogen zero point eight zero nine one moles of hydrogen times the molar mass of hydrogen will give me the mass that that number of moles weighs point eight zero nine one times 1.0 one gives me zero point eight one seven two grams thus the mass of carbon is this the mass of hydrogen is this and the mass of oxygen in the original compound is the six grams sample that we started with - all the carbon - all the hydrogen the remaining mass had to have come from the other oxygen in the molecule that we weren't told anything about six minus three point eight seven six - point eight one seven - gives me a mass of oxygen to one point three zero seven we can get the number of moles of oxygen that that's worth with mass over molar mass that's one point three zero seven grams of oxygen cited by the molar mass of oxygen which is 16 that's zero point zero eight one six eight moles sweet so now I have the relative molar ratios of all I atoms let's recap 0.32 to seven moles of carbon zero point eight zero nine one moles of hydrogen and zero point zero eight one six eight moles of oxygen didn't plan that is very well if only I could find the relative molar ratios of these I can my secret for funding the relative molar ratios for the empirical formula is to divide all of these by whichever ones smallest looks like my smallest number is this one so I'm going to divide this by zero point zero eight one six eight divide this by zero point zero eight one six eight and divide this by zero point zero eight one six eight the reason we divide by the smallest one is because it will make the atom that has the smallest number of atoms in that molecule a ratio of one that divided by itself is going to be one now let's watch the magic happen here for every one oxygen I get point eight zero nine one divided by point zero eight one six eight nine point nine or rather about 10 hydrogen's and the number of carbons is point three two - seven divided by 0.8 one six eight three point nine five which is about four if I had gotten a point five somewhere I simply would have doubled them all to make them all whole numbers thus my empirical formula is four carbons to ten hydrogen's to one oxygen and this is it now I don't know if this is the official formula of molecule this is the empirical formula it's the lowest whole number ratio it could be c 8h 2002 for all i know but this is the actual ratio maybe its butanol or something like that who knows I don't because I wasn't given enough data but yeah so that's how you find the empirical formula when you're only given the mass of carbon dioxide and water in the combustion of a compound that contains carbon and hydrogen and oxygen you find the number of moles of carbon and hydrogen like before find the masses that they account for and the remaining mass is the mass of oxygen that gives you your last number of moles and you could figure out the empirical formula from there who's a boss you and me are both bosses is the answer a best of luck", "E5Vmy1QZccs": "what's up guys Dan here at Presley's we're a slow day in the blind right now and show you a slow-mo between a two and three-quarter three inch and a three and a half inch so here we go two and three-quarter three and a

most popular and that is converting from liters to gallons and then I'll do additional videos and I'll include a link for all of them okay before we begin let me start by saying 1 gallon and this is a English gallon not an imperial gallon is equal to three point seven eight five four one liters kind of an odd number and one liter is equal to point two six four one seven two gallons okay so obviously a gallon is larger than a liter so let's go ahead and start with one say you have a five liter beverage and you'd like to know how much that is in gallons because say you don't think in terms of leaders you think everything in gallons okay so step one what I do is I i'll put liters on top i'll create a fraction and then i do a multiplication and I put always put the unit I want to convert to on top and that is gallons and therefore I'm gonna put leaders on the bottom okay so I next ask myself which is larger gallons or liters and gallons is larger so I'm gonna put a 1 there and I know my conversion one gallon is three point seven eight five four one so I'm gonna do write three point seven eight five four one leaders the leaders will cancel and I just multiply straight across so I then get five divided by three point seven eight five four one and if you do the math that is equal to one point three 2:08 six gallons okay so there's the first one again I created a fraction put leaders on the top placed it over one did a multiplication placed a one by the larger unit did my conversion that is a three maybe the world's messiest three let's look at another example of that this time instead let's go with 15 liters is equal to how many gallons so I'm gonna put gallons on top I'm gonna place this over one I'm going to then put leaders on the bottom I always ask myself which is larger gallons or liters gallons are larger then I put one gallon is equal to three seven five four one leaders the leaders cancel and then I multiply straight across so that will be 15 times one is 15 one times three point seven eight five four one okay and then it's just a simple division problem 15 divided by that and the answer is three point nine six two five eight and obviously gallons okay so now let's do another example let's go the other way and that is let's convert from liters now to gallons so let's go ahead and from excuse me from gallons to liters so say I have seven gallons and I want to know how many liters that is so I now place leaders on top because I want to go to leaders and place gallons on the bottom I then ask myself which is larger gallon is larger one gallon is equal to three point seven eight five four one I'm going to place this over a one gallons cancel seven times three point seven eight five four one is equal to twenty six point four nine seven nine gallons have pants holding them left with leaders let's do one more of those twelve gallons is equal to how many leaders okay so again I'll place twelve gallons over one multiply place the unit I want to get excuse me the unit I'm converting two on top which is leaders place the other unit on the bottom ask myself which is larger gallons or liters gallons are larger one gallon is equal to three point eight five four one liters gallons cancel multiply straight across and you're left with forty five point four two four nine okay anyway that's how you convert from gallons to liters and liters to gallons hope that helps please look for additional videos on converting anything in volume thanks for watching moomoomath uploads a new math video everyday [Music] you [Music]",

Series x3 x5 guys you'll be super helpful video guys will explain website is bank 1 and bank to what I need to know bank 1 and bank to you guys first ok if you have a better oxygen sensor they're usually labeled bank 1 or bank 2 and you will need to know which one to replace second guys for the fuel trim adjustment quite a few things guys as well few injectors you have so many things guys that you need to know why okay certain side is bank one certain side is bank two not same engine guys it's being used in BMW 3-series the 46 5 Series II 39 the X 5 which is the e 53 and X 383 stay with us

engine guys and here guys you have ok can see cylinder number one two three four five six now having all guys which is bank 1 bank 1 guys is cylinder number 1 2 and 3 and bank 2 is cylinder number 3 4 excuse me 1 2 3 and bank 2 is 4 5 and 6 so the first half of the engine imagine that you split the engine into okay the first half of the engine cylinder 1 2 entries bank the second half seen in the remember four five and six is bang - so Bank one guys oxygen sensor for instance or kids this one right here okay with the gray cable okay that's what we need to black cab excuse me that's what we need to be replacing okay right there this is Bank one oxygen sensor Bank two oxygen sensor is down there so that's how you guys know which side is Bank one and thank you hopefully guys the video will

another video drum lesson what you just saw was a groove in 58 time with a sticking pattern so the timing was one and two and three and four and five and one and two and three and four and five n now of course there's so many time signatures and so many beats and grooves that you can play but sticking patterns are just an awesome idea to create a really cool feel within a groove so the sticking pattern that we used on that performance was one end to end was a paradiddle right left right right on three and four and it was an inverted para that'll left right right left three and on five and it was just right left by so here's the entire sticking hand pad one and two and three and four and five and now of course there's bass drum in there and there's some ghost strokes in there as well and you'll see this on the transcription on the end so here's what the basic groove sounded like one two three four five now when you saw the performance I entered it with a real simple snare drum fill that stated the time into the groove so let's go back to the performance video and then we'll check the transcription out on the end alright so there you go nice little groove in 58 with a sticking pattern a couple ghost strokes started I realized there's so many times signature so many beats so many different fills we could have played but again I think it's a great example of how a sticking pattern just creates an awesome feel within a groove so again I'm Todd Walker thanks for watching here comes a transcription up on the board I'll see you soon", "w9cSJBA2ejI": "what's up everybody it's your boy heaven sent this is my smoking channel um by the title of today's video you guys can probably tell what i'm going to be doing already but i just want to say merry christmas to everybody hope everybody had a good uh christmas eve last night and having a good uh christmas day today um i decided to roll up a eighth blunt about like i rolled it up like three or four days ago but i decided i wanted to smoke it today on christmas for you guys so i put together two dutch master wraps and i rolled inside of the wraps like a whole eighth it was like a it's 22.8 from the dispensary so not too bad this is like a 20 blunt right here so what she's looking like she's fat you guys she is dummy fat she's packed she's not packed she's rolled nicely on both sides this is my mouth hole so that's why it's smaller than right here but it's looking really good it's tasting really good as well too i haven't lit it but just the dry pools are something serious it's very nice so yeah i'm just going to be listening to music sparking up this um 3.5 gram blunt and big chilling it's been a while since i smoked something this big but um i usually always smoke like a gram in the blunts but [ __ ] it i'm rambling on too much i got to get this christmas blunt started you guys 3.5 grams that may be normal for a lot of you guys but i don't smoke um gorilla fingers a lot anymore but cheers everybody let's get this park up close uh all right it's getting lit i think it's lit it's definitely lit it's a little bit um it's a little bit good but yeah this was a pretty good christmas i guess i still haven't even celebrated christmas really today yet i celebrated christmas eve yesterday with family i'm gonna celebrate christmas today with a little bit more family anyways i was just doing the same thing pretty much yesterday getting big faded smoking this thing burns very nice i have no idea how long an eighth blunt would last for but i'm going to predict it to last for at least like at least 15 minutes it's hidden i just wish it would be hitting a little bit more [Music] i'm just playing this is pretty much as much as blunt's hit i'm looking for that like concentrate high but i know that's not what i'm going to get from this this is a fire blown for what it is though 2.5 grams two dutch masters put together let me know what you guys are smoking for christmas what you guys are doing for christmas too no no no [Music] but 3.5 grams what do you expect i should probably be listening to christmas music and [ __ ] but to be honest i wasn't really even listening to christmas music this christmas i was listening to just the normal music i normally listened to [Music] i'm chain smoking this i'm not trying to waste none of this in here i'm trying to smoke all this [ __ ] [Music] [Music] definitely hidden on a different level it's getting me pretty faded rap music this is a christmas song and a wrap song it's so smooth though i can basically only taste even though i have two blood wraps there i can taste mostly just the weeds it's a lot of weed [Music] it's a [ __ ] slow burner though fatty too this camera angle may not even look that good i mean the lighting and [ __ ] but it took me a solid 15 minutes trying to find lighting that's good this morning for some reason the sun's just way too bright the angles just weren't working for me but this i like the angle so i had to spark up [Music] this is just going to be a little christmas special 3.5 grams for you guys i won't be smoking 3.5 great eight blunts a lot on this channel but on holidays i might be rolling up this big maybe my next holiday i might roll up two times as fast who knows maybe i'll write roll up an extendo next time i've been thinking about that so stay on the lookout for an extendo video coming up [Music] i got a solid like probably two grams left [ __ ] [Music] gotta get a drink real quick [Applause] invaded [Music] and i do enjoy smoking blunts like this just for the actual act of smoking i enjoy that because i understand and you guys need to get this too if i take one hit off of this pin right here i'm gonna be higher than this whole eighth makes me smoking you know unfortunately that is how it is concentrates are really just that strong and they'll [ __ ] up your tolerance just like that but i still do enjoy smoking just for the act of smoking it doesn't really get me blasted or high anymore but it's definitely a nice buzz complimentary to the concentrator [Music] starting to smoke real good getting down to the roachie big ass roachy i couldn't see how long this was going for but i see it's already a little bit over 10 minutes i'll try to cut it out before 15 minutes just to make sure youtube will let me upload the video but i'm trying to make this one as long as i can for you guys so i have the blonde left very fat you guys like seeing me roll up fat and want to see me roll up fatter let me know in the comment section down below you guys want to see me smoke more concentrates take more blinkers let me know as well i'm always down to do that really smooth i don't know how it's so smooth since they're i'm going to repeat there's two blunt wraps

videos I want to let everyone know about how my original channel for those of you who are all looking for me it was suspended terminated for absolutely no reason this is something that's going on right now YouTube is going around and basically suspending like all smaller youtubers channels so I found out at least I'm not the only one you know but yeah my channel was suspended for absolutely no reason well we have a theory as to why it happened which I'll make a video about that again but yeah I had a had my youtube channel since 2006 and I had around 2000 subscribers and I had videos that had like over twenty thirty thousand views I even had like one video to had like over a hundred thousand views so you know I was getting paid by Adsense every two weeks and my youtube channel even helped me to buy my new house here they used my you know YouTube channel my pay from Google Adsense to help get the home loan to buy my new house so my YouTube channel was and still is very important to me especially since I've got videos on there of my dad when he was still alive and my cats when they were kittens and I mean I had like nearly a thousand videos uploaded that are just you know gone now you know so because they don't give you a chance to like you know save them you know download them again or whatever so um you know so that yeah yeah so I mean you know luckily um if you guys search you know like Jimmy Hatsune cuz you know my original YouTube channel name was a Mopar underscore me Q underscore ps4 I was going to change it to Mopar underscore Miku underscore kit you know because a kit you know from Knight Rider there yeah I was going to change it to uh you know it's a kit so uh yeah I was gonna do that but um you know didn't get uh didn't get around to it yeah I was gonna change it to that but um but then you you know I still had Jimmy Hatsune and the name you know so it would be you know Mopar Miku ps4 or you know Mopar Miku kit you know cuz like I think that's what I am on Twitter and my name is the same like on every social you know media platform so uh but yeah and then afterwards you know it was Jimmy hunt soon eh so either way you know like I'm sure that you know somebody's gonna search and be like hey you know what what's going on here cuz I mean I had nearly like a thousand videos and with all those views and stuff you know somebody had to have noticed but um I'll get into that again a bit more I'll make like a video specific about that but I'm trying to you know upload videos to my new channel here and I'm gonna re upload a lot of you know videos that I had before you know videos of kit my tractor cuz those videos like went crazy on YouTube you know two tractor videos um how to's and you know DIYs and just you know different things here but um I wanted to do a video of this real quick this is the nostalgia electronics retro series this is the I don't have the box it's the three-in-one I think that's what it's called yeah it's the well you guys have seen this on youtube so if you're watching you you guys know what this is I think crazy Russian hacker did a video on this already it's the three-in-one breakfast station I think that's what it's called but yeah it's nostalgia electronics it's the retro series I have this down here in my 1100 square foot finished basement home movie theater because that's what I'm building down here is a home movie theater I can't really I'm not gonna really show it like right now I mean because I know a lot of you are like interested because it's like it's like um it's like coca-cola themed there's that's another purchase from Amazon right there that's the coca-cola hot dog roller I need to clean it because I just made some hotdogs on it you know earlier but I need to clean it but yeah these these I purchased like last year for my for my birthday I bought myself these for my birthday last year and I just opened them now I never I never even a a day we're just in the box because you know I've just been like I've been I'm still working on like you know still working on painting down here cuz it's it's an 1,100 square foot finished basement with like wall the wall you know wall-to-wall carpeting and stuff so yes so you know painting is kind of a bit of an issue so I'm kind of you know still working down here oh this is a 1950s buffet that this is on here then I got like a little kitchen area back there that's the door outside you know from the back there we go that's focused yeah this is like the door coming around the back is that the house is a ranch so you know I'm downstairs you know so you come around to get into the back here you can either go down the stairs from the kitchen or you know go around the back of the house which is what everybody does who visits me and of course the garage is right right here so I'd show you the rest of the room but my cat misty is dying of cancer so I've got the room kind of all disheveled and stuff you know cuz I'm trying to get things set up for her you know that's another video that I was getting ready to make on my original YouTube channels about my cat misty having cancer because you know I would like help and support with that you know she's doing okay now but you know she's got a um a lump you know she's got cancer so um but yeah I was just making I was making some like roast beef and cheddar melts there and I made a pot of coffee as you can see makes exactly I mean it's it's dead-on accurate it's perfect um but yeah I thought I would do a video again I'm sorry I get off-topic guys like I started talking about like other things showing you guys kind of other things and stuff it's just I I have autism so for those watching I'm sure you can understand you know I have autism so I I sort of have a hard time doing these videos that's why I losing my other channels so difficult but again like I said I bought this last year never opened it just did it now I don't have the box I already threw it away but yeah I bought this last year and I use it every single day I mean obviously I've got like a really huge kitchen upstairs but I'm down here in the finished basement and you know when I'm working in the garage on kit when I'm watching a movie because like I said this is a this is a movie theater you know fact I've got like a movie theater that sign right there you kind of can't really see it it's hard to see but that sign right there actually came from a closed movie theater and that'll be hung up right there so um but yeah I bought this I you know it had mixed reviews like a lot of bad reviews I think the bad reviews were just from people who just didn't know how to use it because this thing is fantastic I mean you can see you've got like just just the grille on top of an off toast baked which that's what that's what it's on right now you know for this but then you can just like warm and heat stuff which I might have been better off doing that for these because I think I sort of burnt them a bit but that's okay because I kind of um like them that way but um and it came with that pan too and of course to use it you go to put the timer on however you need you know to use the grill on top or the it's got it it's got a cover to but I have that in the drawer y'all do a more in-depth video later there's there's the crumb tray right there it's got the crumb tray I'll do a better a video later on but um I love this thing I think I paid like $60 for it or something I don't remember I bought it for my birthday along with that because like I said I'm doing a coca-cola themed down here that thing's fantastic - this hot dog roller like I got to clean it but it's easy to clean you literally just rinse this thing off and all the grease everything comes right off it's amazing I mean it's really and it cooks like I swear this thing I got to do a review on this thing - this is the lid where you can put like the buns to warm the buns but um I'll my neighbors Hayden and Gavin they'll tell you this thing makes the best hot dogs ever on earth it's amazing they're just perfect I'm the absolutely perfect hot dogs it's great I love that thing and that was that was really cheap I think that thing was like thirty bucks but yeah this I think was like 60 and I use it every day I make multiple pots of coffee on it the coffee that makes is absolutely brilliant I mean it's really good it's actually better than the coffee on our real expensive coffeemaker upstairs in the kitchen I've actually on the griddle on top just using that I've cooked like baked beans like I put a I put a pot on here you know a pot that fits a smaller pot and I've cooked baked beans on here perfectly I mean this thing it cooks fast to it and so you got to watch your stuff I've done cookies in here I've done Barbies curly fries and this thing they came out better than like even Harvey's bagels like I said you got to watch because this thing it gets hot there's like no real temperature control so you know stuff can be burnt I mean obviously those are a little bit charred I mean I did last night I did White Castle burgers in there oh they came out great they came out a little bit burnt obviously because I let the middle a bit too long because I was vacuuming as I was doing this but even still this thing is absolutely it's brilliant I love it I mean I I thought it was gonna be kind of gimmicky that this this grill on topic comes off you can rinse it it's like um nonstick but I mean what I do is I just I have like a couple you know camping pots and pants that I just put on it and it gets so hot it just it works just like your regular stove it really it really does and we've got like a really top-of-the-line Frigidaire and gallery you know a flat top stove and oven and everything upstairs you know top-of-the-line and this thing it cooks just as well as that you know it really does I mean for you know it's such a tiny thing and you know we go camping at least we used to anyway this thing here definitely something to take camping with you um if you've got an RV it you have to have it I mean I like so I've got it down here because this is all gonna be like a whole you know snack you know snack station here like right now like said the room is kind of all messed up because you know I said I can't miss Diaz cancer but this will be a whole like snack station area down here you know I've even got a um it's supposed to be it's supposed to be right here it's supposed to be on my riser my platform right here but I have it down here cuz I was out cleaning it because it does feel poor but this is a I got this off Amazon a couple years ago - this is the coca-cola vending machine off Amazon and I've had this thing for a couple years now and it still it still works and as you can see I've got you know vanilla and regular cocoa in it and you can see from the glass there you can see it absolutely works I mean this thing you know some of these some of these buttons do you know they stick a little bit but uh it works it's absolutely perfect I love this thing I've had it for years and it's it's been through two moves and it survived you know I mean it's just it's fantastic and then you know I've got my little again this came off Amazon Mike my girlfriend Allie bought me bought me that set for my birthday this is the coca-cola bar table and stools set and they go up and down you know uh so you can kind of see how like I said everything's like a mess in here now because of my cat Misti you know her having cancer she's on she's on the red sofa there she's she's sleeping but yeah there's the coca-cola um bar stools in a table set and uh they spin and everything you know so yeah I've got like this little area here's like a diner you know for like a movie theater so uh but no this thing's fantastic I've cooked everything in it and I use this thing every single day like I said I just used it right now and it's just I mean you can see how it just you got to watch the stuff I had these in for 20 minutes and I was vacuuming so that's kind of why they got a bit burnt but I'll do another video later maybe tonight I'm gonna have Allie and my mom bring me home some hot dogs so I can show you guys that and then I'll cook some more I'll cook like a pot of beans and stuff on it but it's this thing's a great purchase I think Amazon still has it I don't know if it's in any other colors but this is the nostalgia electrics one and I like since the three and one our breakfast station maker you know something like that likes it makes makes great coffee it's just perfect cuz you know I've got I've got my garage right there obviously I've got kit in the garage you know but when I've got customers that bring me cars to work on you know they can come in you know they can come in here they can sit down have a cup of coffee watch TV a movie whatever they want you don't have a hot dog while I work on their car because you know I like them to wait you know that way they can see you know what I'm doing you know make sure they're happy with the work but uh yeah so I thought for my new channel this would be a good video this is just a quick one I'll do a more detailed one later where you can actually see me cooking on it but um for right now I thought that's good enough you know just to get things rolling on my new channel here like I said I got to start over so uh you know thanks again guys for watching definitely subscribe I need the subscribers be sure to like share and I'll catch you next time",

is obviously dependent on how much great and you're going to do but I would start with a smaller amount and see how you go and then mix up a bit more if you need some more later so in this example you can see there's just a tiny little bit of water in the bottom of that bucket I'm just going to add the great to the water a little bit at a time I'm just using a bucket travel I'm just gonna mix up round water like that powder starts to mix with the water just add a little bit more powder bit by bit [Music] great with the water you want to get it to a consistency a bit like this get a small bit of great on your bucket trowel turn it upside down and you'll find that sticks to the trowel but it's still slightly wet and that is the perfect consistency for me when I'm mixing great just let that go off for five minutes and then give it a quick mix again before you apply it to your tiles and it's that simple do why how to have some tips and product review please watch my other videos and don't

equals negative three times the absolute value of one third r minus two plus seven so we begin by subtracting two from both sides to get rid of the single term on the left hand side we're also going to add 3 times the absolute value of 1 3 r minus 2 to both sides to get rid of the absolute value term on the right hand side this gives 10 times the absolute value of 1 3 r minus 2 equals five now to get our absolute value term by itself we're going to divide both sides by ten this gives the absolute value of one-third r minus two equals one-half now that we have the absolute value term by itself this means we can rewrite as one-third r minus two equals one-half or one-third r minus two equals negative one-half starting on the left-hand side after adding two to both sides we get one-third r equals five-halves to get rid of the fraction we're going to multiply both sides by 3 and this results in r equals 15 halves moving to the right hand side again we're going to add 2 to both sides get rid of the single term and this gives 1 3 r equals 3 halves we'll multiply both sides by three to get rid of the fractions and this gives r equals nine halves and those two are our final answers",

it will have six eighth notes in our bar of music in every other video I've been working in the time signature of 4/4 which is four quarter notes to each bar so this is going to start us moving in the direction of looking a little bit more at more complicated time signatures a bit later on but for now let's just get to our three patterns for today and we'll look at the more tricky stuff in the next tutorial Tuesday here is pattern number one one two three four five six one two three four five six here is pattern number 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and here's our final pattern 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5

I wasn't able to completely solve the problem so I went ahead this time and started setting up the table to begin with so we have a candy store sells chocolate-covered almonds for 650 per pound and chocolate-covered peanuts for four dollars per pound the manager decides to make a bridge mix that combines the almonds with the peanuts she wants the bridge mix to sell for five dollars per pound and there should be no loss in revenue from selling the bridge mix versus the almonds and peanuts alone how many pounds of chocolate-covered almonds and chocolate-covered peanuts are required to create 50 pounds of bridge mix so we try and figure out what they're saying here and just picture that in your head where you're taking some almonds and you're taking some peanuts and you're now going to be mixing those together to create to create a new concoction here well let's talk about what we know we know from the problem that the almonds cost 650 per pound so I have set this up as I'm gonna have almonds mixed with peanuts to create this bridge mix and then thinking about how you buy things at the store you know you think about how you buy produce or whatever you know you buy it and you weigh it on the little scales and you if it's so much per pound then you know you have to multiply the weight of the object times the price per pound to tell you how much you're going to have to pay total so that's what I used as my column headings here this is 650 per pound for the almonds it also tells us that the peanuts are $4 per pound and we want to create a bridge mix that would be $5 per pound continuing on in the problem we also know that we have we want 50 pounds of bridge mix so our the weight of our mix we want to be 50 pounds the and talk to us about how much almonds and how much peanuts were mixing together but we do know that the total has to be 50 so whatever the way to the almonds are the peanuts would have to be 50 - that think about it again if you had you know 45 pounds of almonds you'd have only 5 pounds left for peanuts now if we multiply the weight times the price per pound we get the total amount of money that has to be spent for those almonds so that would be 650 times x-4 dollars times 50 minus X and 5 dollars times 50 went by doing this and setting up the table this last column is our equation because we're going to be taking almonds mixing it together with peanuts to end up with a total mix and we don't want to the the money to be any different whether you bought the almonds and the peanuts alone or whether you buy the mix together the money has to be the same so our equation then is going to look like 650 times X plus 4 dollars times 50 minus x equals 5 dollars times 50 and then we continue solving 650 X plus 4 dollars times 50 that's going to be 200 minus 4 times X is going to be 4x I'm going to go ahead and drop the dollars they're equals $5 times 50 is going to be 250 dollars I'm just gonna leave it as 250 now we combine like terms so 6.5 minus 4 would be 2.5 x plus 200 equals 250 and then when we subtract 200 from both sides we get 2.5 x equals 50 and then dividing both sides by 2.5 we get x equals 20 so X is 20 tells us that that's the weight of the Allman's 20 pounds which leaves 30 pounds left for the weight of the peanuts", "zLsZJeYLAO0": "perhaps you are planning a new car audio system and you find yourself wondering how much amplifier power should I have for the subwoofers and how much amplifier power should I have for the midbass mid-range and tweeter speakers what is a good balance between the two if I'm just adding a subwoofer to a factory car audio system at what point does the subwoofer power become overbearing in relation to the rest of the speakers in this video we're going to talk about power balancing and why it's important on your quest to install an amazing car audio system [Music] hey I'm mark welcome to car audio fabrication here on this channel I do car audio builds and reviews and I love helping you learn how to design build and install your dream car audio system music alone is a powerful thing but when we can truly experience the music and have it be powerful and sound amazing there's just nothing better than that I have tons of other car audio videos here on this channel so if you're new here check them out in the meantime let's get into this video so when I first got into car audio the first upgrade that I ever did was adding two 12 inch subwoofers to a factory system all of my buddies had car audio systems and of course I had to outdo them so I got a 1200 watt subwoofer amplifier so what happened of course there was a ton of subwoofer output but overall the system was just not fun to listen to as soon as I would turn up the volume high enough in order to actually hear the mids and highs they would become distorted and just sound muddy and unclear the problem was I was needing more power and more performance out of those speakers in order to match the subwoofer amplifier but it just wasn't there so it wasn't possible this is a common issue for car audio newcomers I totally understand it you want to have massive subwoofers you want to have insane amount of power and massive bass but to make your system truly sound amazing you have to adhere to the rules of what I call power balancing so here's the way it works we're going to break our power into two different categories the first category is amplifier power that is for subwoofers in other words our speakers that are playing from the range of frequencies from like 20 Hertz up to 80 Hertz next we have essentially the rest of the power for all the other speakers everything that covers the audio range from 80 Hertz all the way up to 20 kilohertz everything else covers our mid base our mid-range and our tweeter speakers so for our power balancing rule of thumb just remember that there's two different categories power for subwoofers and power for everything else before we move on I want to clarify that whenever I mentioned power in this video I'm refering to watts RMS or constant power I am NOT referring to max power just ignore that as far as we are concerned for looking at the power of these amplifiers we're gonna be looking at the constant power ratings so here's the power balance rule of thumb let's start with a system that when you sum the two different categories you have less than a total of 400 watts for system power less than 400 watts you should try to stick to a 50% to 50% relationship between the two categories in other words let's say we're using a factory head unit and it's a hundred watts RMS a hundred watts should be 50% of our total system power so since we're using the head unit to power everything in our speaker category we want to use our new subwoofer amplifier to power the subwoofer category if 50% of our power is 100 watts in the speaker category that means that for our subwoofer category we should also only use a hundred watts now we can deviate from this slightly and we can use a 40% to 60% split as an example say that we still have the factory head unit that's a hundred watts we could use 150 watt amplifier for the subwoofer and that would give us a 40% to 60% split in other words the radio is accounting for 40% of the total system volume and the subwoofer amplifier is now 60% I consider the range from a 50/50 split to a 4060 split acceptable for total powers less than 400 watts so using that example with the 100 watt factory amplifier where you start to get into issues where the speaker's can't keep up is when you use over a hundred and fifty watts of power for the subwoofer now I already know what you guys are thinking mark the majority of us are using way over 400 watts total for our system and you're right and that's why we're gonna spend a little bit more time on explaining the second part of this rule of thumb for when you're using over 400 watts total when our total system power is over 400 watts we can be more lenient with the ratio and have more power applied to the subwoofer when we're using over 400 watts of total system power I recommend a ratio from a 4060 split all the way up to a 25/75 split as an example let's say that for my speaker category I'm using this four channel 800 watt amplifier that means that you could use a 1200 watt amplifier for the subwoofer or you could even use up to a 2400 watt amplifier for the subwoofers with this 800 watts for the speakers now how did I do that math I promise you guys it's really simple I'm gonna show you real quick and give you a lesson on ratios you guys know that I said that we can use from a 4060 split all the way up to a 25/75 split so let's say we know that we want to use this for channel 800 total Watts amplifier for our speakers the percentage on top of each of these equations represents the speaker amplifier so I can put 800 on the top so in this first example I want to find out the bottom what that value will be for the subwoofer amplifier we're going to be determining a range that we can use for the subwoofer amplifier for the low end of the range we're going to use the 4060 split so let's write 40 over 60 we need to know this value here X in order to determine how many watts we need for our subwoofer amplifier now I know this might look like a daunting math equation but it's really not that bad in order to solve for X all we have to do is take 800 multiplied by 60 so 800 times 60 which equals 48,000 and then we'll divide that value by 40 the 48 thousand divided by 40 equals 1200 so what we've done is we have solved for this value here X is going to be 1200 so in other words when we're using it an 800 watt amp for our speakers going by the 4060 rule we can use a 1200 watt amp for our subwoofer let's go through this math real quick one more time just so you guys fully understand let's say that we're using it an 800 watt amplifier still and this time we're going to abide by the 25 to 75 rule and again we want to find X all we do is we multiply whatever's here by whatever so 800 times 75 which is 60,000 and then we divide that by whatever value is on top here in this case 25 so in this case we get 2,400 so x equals 2,400 in summary since we're using over a total of 400 watts for the entire system we know that we can use a ratio from 4060 up to 25 75 and we found that in other words with this 800 watt amplifier I can use anywhere from 1200 Watts up to 2400 watts for my subwoofer power and the way to look at this is you could even use a 50-50 split which is more of a sound quality type install so you could have your 4 channel 800 watt amp and then a 1 channel 800 watt subwoofer amplifier or if you're kind of looking for a good balance between sound quality and bass output a good pair would be the 800 watt amp with this 1200 watt subwoofer amplifier and then finally if you were just going for massive base on the high end of the spectrum you could use a 2400 watt amplifier or 2 1200 watt amplifiers for your subwoofers and an 800 watt amplifier and your speaker's will be able to keep up so now that we understand power balance in between our speakers and our subwoofer amplifiers we're on our way to making a great sounding car audio system I hope you guys enjoyed this video and I know I know youtubers all the time they're always saying hey can you hit that like

what fraction of a clockwise devolution does our end of a clock turn through when it goes from a c2 9 b 4 7 b 7 to 10 thousand nine month 1863 so yes demonstrated the clocks were which goes from 3 to 9 so now you can see that it goes half of the revolution that is to 90 degrees therefore the transfer is 1 by 2 be four to seven so initially it is at four little seven it goes 15 minutes both this for was at key and seven was at six they put 90 degree so it is one-fourth of the total revolution this is your b5 see seven to ten well again take seven to six and ten to nine ten - nine what you get is again one force of the whole revolution whole circle this is second with this third and this is fourth part so in this manner we can find what fraction for clockwise revolution does your clock moves from 12 to 9 this is 12 and this is 9 this is the dad gene that is clockwise through 12 to 6 it is half of the revolution and then 90 degrees more that is 3/4 of the whole revolution now right here clock rolls take 1 to 12 and 10 to 9 so it will be again the same problem as was in e so again the answer would be 3 by 4 F from 6 to 3 here it is very clearly visible this goes from 63 first 6 to 12 in opposite side that means in parts and from 12 to 3 is 1 another part it means T by 4 this was your question number one second we're fill the hand of a cloth stop this fit so these are the following questions starts at 12 and make half of a revolution clockwise start stick to and make half of a revolution clockwise starts at five make one-fourth of a revolution clockwise starts at five and makes C force of a revolution stop right so all the directions are clockwise so this is how we will do it one thing should be kept in mind then we move three numbers it is like this one two three or you can say three Rs you can take any direction clockwise or anti-clockwise or you can also say 15 minutes that's 5 10 15 similarly to the other side 5 10 15 we take 90 degree rotation we've got to remember this this also means 1/4 of a revolution so one photo revolution is equal to 90 degrees or 15 minutes so we consider our first case for here initial was 12 and it makes half revolution that is to 90 degrees and also one thing when the plot goes opposite it means half of the revolution so in first case it is at six to fix is the answer now for the B part the clock starts at 2 and make half of the revolutions again the same thing that is opposite side stops at 8/3 5 starts at 5 and goes to 8 we will see by taking 5 10 15 minutes all three numbers at is six seven and eight it goes G R so it is at eight now the D part starts at five and it goes up to two so you can do it other ways that is 15 minutes that is six seven eight is 15 minutes one rotation that means one fourth of the rotation and from then nine ten eleven another rotation another 1/4 rotation then 12 1 2 another 1/4 rotation this makes the 4th of the revolution this is how you to expression number second which direction will you face if you start facing so these are the questions based upon this we will do our answer here this is the direction and Sun rises in the east and sets in the west so what we are given here which direction will you face if you start facing east so we can look at this sir she facing east towards the Sun rising side and she makes half of the division clockwise so she'll be act half of revolution means opposite so she'll be at best position this was their way part now be East now she's facing east this is your East again same direction and she completes one and half revolution one means the complete revolution happening she'll be at least then she takes half of the revolution ask me again opposite she she be at West now see Park West now the girl is facing west where the Sun sets and makes 3/4 of a revolution anti-clockwise this is your anti-clockwise so see force can be calculated as first opposite but it's known best [Music] then 1/4 of rotation is left that is chic yet north so this was here be part now the deep five south and make one full revolution which is facing South now and makes one full revolution one full revolution means chill bro from anti clockwise or clockwise direction does not matter so therefore she'll be at the same point because she is taking one complete revolution therefore she gets out we should be specified clockwise or anti-clockwise well for this question it is not important so this was your question number third question 4 what part of a revolution have you turned to if you stand facing a piece and turn clockwise to face north the south and turn clockwise to face please eat best in the on clockwise to face P so this is your direction and ews you have to find revolution you have done so if you are facing at ease now you are at ease and you turn clockwise based not you turn clockwise not in this direction is anti-clockwise you have to turn clockwise so we'll go in another direction that means seaport of a complete revolution depart the X out and turn clockwise to face least you have to go all to come west not in East Latin speed in clockwise direction so a can with several key port of the revolution you have traveled key right angles now you are accessed and turn clockwise to face from west to east clockwise that means half of the complete revolution to travel to right angle or to ninety degrees so this is your part that is half of the whole revolution perjure for spot depression to find the number of right angles turned to by the our hand o'clock when it goes from 2 to 6 to 2 8 5 to 11 10 to 1 12 to 9 thousand six so these are the clocks and we have shown our hand of the clock the first case which is at 3 red denotes see that is the initial point we denotes the direction and blue denotes the final position so it goes 15 minutes or you can say one right angle that is one two three therefore one beep our initial position is at two and it goes wait so it is opposite to 2 it means simple two right angles whenever there will be a straight line it will mean two right angles then part initial is 5 and 11 okay in the same situation opposite side that means two right angles aren't teapot 10 to 1 so your initial position is 10 will be equal 1 it is going 15 minutes or three RS so it is 90 degree or 1 right angle you can also do it as take one to twelve and ten to nine so it becomes very easy to visualize 90-degree angle teapot 12 to 9 it is very clearly visible 12 to 6 will be half of the revolution or you can say right angles plus 1 right angle has to be here so it is total three right angles to go from 12 to 19 this was your teapot f5 from 12 to 6 how many right angles it is very easy half of the rotation that means two right angles so this was the question number five we have found right angles for the following clocks six how many right angles do you make if you start facing a thousand turn clockwise to West not in turn anti-clockwise to ease left and turn the best South and turn to north so this is directional this is your news NE WS but it's directions both attitudes we have in total as from where news words came from NE WS so a part you are standing at South and you have to find right angles you made so a is South you're facing south and you turn clockwise to west so this is your clockwise direction you go anti-clockwise within your clockwise so we made one right angle so therefore the answer is one be barred they are facing north and you turn anti-clockwise to East so this is your north and you turning anti-clockwise East that is you go from west and south then East that is simple three right angles out of four total right angles this is your B Part C we are standing at West and turn to west so here important thing has to be noticed that we are given direction that is words your vest that is your left inside to move anti-clockwise best itself that is we will make one purple revolution so we will reach to the same position that is to turn four right angles because for tight angles are there in one complete revolution so their direction is important see that so just see now deep south and turn to north you are it's out and you go to north so you can go both ways that is clockwise and anti-clockwise direction doesn't matter North is opposite to South so what does it mean it means two right angles straight away so here clockwise and anti-clockwise direction doesn't matter because we are reaching with a knot whereas it was not the case lips apart because we eat it was saying that you have to move from West that is your left inside it will just fix fly seven where will our hand for clock stops if it starts from six and turns one right angle from eight and turns through right angles from ten and turns to three right angles from seven and turn through two straight angles so this is the set of clocks on which we will find our answers we will take only clockwise direction so first of all from six and turns to one right angle Michelle is by red two is for direction and green is for final position so from here we move three RS that is seven eight and nine routine say fifteen minutes one right angle that is you are at nine now from eight in turn right angles initial position here is eight and you go to P it is very clearly visible that is it that it is opposite so it means right angles and we are at 2 so 2 is the final position this is your teapot now see from 10 and turns through three right angles so here we are at ten first of all we can do it in very simple way we'll go for for that a straight angle that means two right angles so we have completed two right angles we are left only one right angles that means 15 more minutes or three more ours to each wedge 7 therefore the answer is 7 now from 7 and turn through 2 straight angles so at 7 2 straight angle means we are going to make one complete revolution that is we are going to reach the same position from where you started that is we make 4 right angles first one is for 1 that is opposite side and from that one we move straight angle again to get ourselves to 7 so this is how into question number 7 e box so that was your last question question number 7", "rMmJnY1F8-Q": "Good day students welcome to mathgotserved.com\nin this clip were going to be going over how to soul mixture problems for the be making\nuse of the bucket method to help us set up the equation so that we can so then with ease\ndon't forget to visit our website@mathgotserved.com for access to a wide variety of math tutorials\nranging from algebra all the way to calculus let's take a look at question number one in\ntreats a storm that yields on not sells peanuts for five dollars a pound and catching nuts\nfor three dollars become the store owner desires to sell 80 pounds of peanuts that one of the\nsites to mix a certain amount of cashews with the 80 pounds of peanuts for a price of four\ndollars a pound how much cashews is shoot be sold in pounds to make the same amount\nof profit right so we're going to go ahead and set up our bracket so on the left side\nof the equation related have individually priced buckets okay we just cashews and peanuts\nin another right side will have the combination okay so let's ofdraw a bucket for our peanuts\nto that first  and then we'll draw a bucket for our cashew\nnuts and then the combination now let's go ahead and label our bucketsso for the first\none this will be total price of peanuts okay the price peanuts only okay so this buckets\nwill have only peanuts so total price of peanuts only loss this one will be for cashew nuts\nokay total price ofu not only right so this is the total price is the were sold individually\nnow the total price is a were sold individually should be equal to the total price of peanuts\nan S you not combination okay so if you look at the problem there is a situation where\nthe owner of the store desires to sell AP notes and cashew combination for four dollars\nyou how okay right so this is the degree to set up now how do we feel our individual buckets\nthe equation for calculating the total price is as follows so price is equal to unit price\nmultiply by the quantity right now Om with the population our bucketsusing this formula\nso is buckets will have unit price and quantity okay so let's let's the unit price up here\nunits price and then quantity down here quantity I now let's start with peanuts individually\nis go back to the problem what is the unit price peanuts the unit price of peanuts is\nof the line that in green is going to be five dollars of find all the pound or peanuts to\nthe unit price of peanuts is five dollars now what is the quantity of peanuts that the\nowaner desires to sell is to sell 80 pounds okay so is that the quantity will so desire\nto sell 80 pounds okay this is the total price for peanuts is so alone now how about cashew\nnuts how one is a unit price YOU unit price of cashew nuts is three dollars a pound okay\ncashew nuts we know the pound so three dollars in the bucket percussions and then the quantity\nof cashew nuts is what how many pounds of Christian nuts does the over desire to sell\nthat's what we looking for so let's call that X okay now Om let's look at a combination\nthe peanuts and catching of combination now what is the price that the owner desires to\nso the mix off cashew nuts and peanuts he desires to sell it for four dollars a pound\nso we have four dollars for the combination now how many pounds is that going to be we\nknow that the woman is asked to sell 80 pounds of peanuts and a certain amount of pounds\nof cashew nuts for the combine price of four dollars a pound so what is that going to be\nis simply going to be eighty-four expression for the peanuts plus X for the cashew nuts\nokay so now we can now set of an equation okay so the total price of peanuts is the\nunit price times quantities is going to be five times eighty value of the total price\nof peanuts to presentation up to be three times X and then total price of peanuts and\ncashew nuts combination will be four times eighty X so can you see the equation that\nwe can use to solve for the total amount of cashew of now let's go ahead and change your\nbucket equation into an actual algebraic equation the algebraic equation will have is pie times\neighty lots three times X equals four times eighty plus X okay now five times eighty is\nthe total price of peanuts only three times X the total price of cashew nuts only and\ntherefore times the quantity eighty plus X is the total price of the combination of peanuts\nand cashew nuts I let's go ahead and out solve this resulting algebraic equation or X right\nso five times eighty is four hundred plus three X equals now the distribute for to this\nto terms all I terms in the parenthesis values three hundred and twenty plus four X now it\nisolate X I can subtract three X from both sides okay so that yields four hundred equals\nthree twenty plus X now you can subtract three hundred and twenty from both sides in our\nfinal result is X equals eighty eighty right so what of the answer me go back to the problem\nwhere to find how about cashew nuts should be sold to make the same amount of profit\nso let's write down what the answer means within a context of the problem 80 pounds\ncashew nuts nuts must be sold in order

addressing structural repairs you know the kind that affects the integrity of your boat this kind of damage can happen in a number of different ways you know maybe you're you know coming along and you hit a rock a deadhead or well maybe somebody hits you but the the end result being you've got damage that extends through all the layers of your laminates from the exterior all the way to the interior now when I'm a prime looking at a fiberglass project I will break those down into I guess one of two categories either they're cosmetic or they're structural and although the the repair process for either one is relatively the same there are some key differences you know when you break them down into their basic steps or their basic you know process what you're looking to do is remove damaged glass lay up your new material and then go over top of that with your finishing surface whether it's paint or gel coat now with when you're looking at a structural repair that process needs to be done on both sides of laminate both exterior and the interior faced with a cosmetic type repair that can almost always be done on one side typically the exterior side so looking at our test panel here you can see that there's a there's there's a pretty visible hole right here and this hole extends all the way through the laminate and comes out the back yeah so just for argument's sake let's uh let's just call this impact damage yeah that sounds good something definitely hit it but so the so this is something that would definitely be considered a structural type of here because it goes all the way through the laminate now structural repair doesn't always mean a hole it could be cracks heavy cracks you know from impact or you know really severe delamination you know whatever whatever that the cause is the I guess the the general definition is that the damage extends through the full thickness of the now the first thing I'm going to do when I'm looking at I guess putting together a plan for repairing this is I'm going to I need to determine what the overall thickness is of the laminate I'm going to be repairing generally speaking I guess a good general rule of thumb is you you you operate on a twelve to one basis meaning that for every inch of thickness you know that you're going to be repairing your actual repair area extends 12 inches now for this let's just call this let's just call it a quarter inch whether it's this size hole or even smaller if it goes all the way through I'd always do a minimum of a six-inch diameter so we're going to come out three inches come out three inches and this is actually going to be the size of our repair area even though this this hole is only a half inch I want to make sure that all of our the new glass that we're going to be laying up extends far enough over so that it is a very strong and solid repair and we're going to be running this same taper on both sides of laminate now on this side because this was the exit side the exit side of the damage I'm going to actually I can see where the cracking extends out to so I'm going to start from the edge of the each edge of the the damage that I can see I'm going to extend that out three inches and then this will actually be the size of repair whichever side is bigger that's decided that's the that's going to determine the size of repair so for putting in these tapers if I were if I were working outside or if I know the repair area was much larger than this I would definitely be using a I guess a high speed grinder with a very very aggressive grinding head on it but for this because it's a relatively small area and I'm indoors I don't want to fire up my grinder and get glass floating around all over the air I'm actually just going to use my and ER that is hooked up to a vacuum and I'm gonna be using 36 grit paper I want to remove this you know move it as fast as possible nobody likes sanding I really do not like sanding so I want to get it off as quickly as possible one one thing that I want to mention here is because we are going to be grinding glass glass and your lungs do not mix very well they they don't like each other so you need to that you need to take some safety precautions and first and foremost make sure you are wearing some sort of protection whether it's you know one the little paper masks I don't really recommend those I I think like a full-face respirator is a much more effective way to I guess keep this stuff I'll call it stuff for the kiddos to keep this stuff out of your lungs and also Tyvek suit and if you're going to be using a grinder a high speed grinder make sure you've got some eye protection on all right I'm going to do a little change in plans because well it's actually kind of nice outside so being this is a small panel I'm just going to take the whole works right outside and I'm gonna actually use my grinder because it'll be much much faster well that was fun mmm no not really granny glasses never fun but it part of the process I guess let me let me zoom in so you can see a little bit better what I did alright so looking at this here you can see what was initially just a little half-inch hole by time you got all the damage removed it actually you know got a little bit bigger right now this is about two inches across give or take a little bit maybe a little bit bigger and this surface was tapered on both sides of the laminate and I guess looking at another one of my little fancy diagrams here this is kind of a cross-section of what what we did here with that with the grinding with the top in the bottom of the laminate and then this part through here would be the hole and essentially what we did is ground it down to a nice taper to a fine point on both sides so now we're going to start coming in we're going to clean this up and then we're gonna start laying in our glass the first the first patch that we're going to do is going to be just a little bit bigger than the actual size of the hole and then each successive patch is going to be larger and larger and larger until we've got enough glass built up to where we're at a finished thickness for the rest of the surrounding area and we're pretty much right out to the edges of our tapered area both sides well the first thing we're going to do before we start even thinking about laying up glass is we're going to clean the surface everything that were everything that's going to be getting new material laminated on top we're going to wipe that down really really well with acetone till we're not getting any any kind of smearing or I guess anything coming up on the rag we want a good clean surface so that we get a good bond and then then we can start tearing our glass if it's not if it's not clean you'll be able to see some streaking when your I guess after the acetone evaporates on here if you're seeing any kind of streaking then it's not quite clean enough so just keep flipping the rags and get new ones and just keep wiping it down now the glass that we're going to be using on here is where aliy use two different types of glass almost exclusively for repair work and that would be one point five ounce CSM or chopped strand mat II and then also 1708 biaxial fiberglass the reason I use a combination of the two is I want to use the 1708 for the strength you know that that has a lot of a lot of strength there's a lot of material a lot of glass there it's very very strong material and the top strand matting I use that for two reasons one because chopped strand mat has a tendency to hold a lot of resin think of CSM as kind of the the glue layer between different types of laminates it makes sure that there's plenty of resin there so lets you get a good solid adhesion and also it is the it's the type of fiberglass that sands very very smooth so when we're laying this up the first glass or the first layer that I'm gonna put on here is going to be chopped strand mat II and then I'll do a layer of 1708 and then depending on where we're at with thickness at that point then I think I'm just going to go with two more layers of chopped strand mat so that when we're sanding this down we get a good smooth surface we're not going to get any print through from from oh like a weave or a fabric weave it'll sand nice and that'll give us a good smooth surface for for finishing and that's that's the process that I'm going to be doing on both sides so one layer a chopped strand Manning first 1708 over that and then two more layers of chopped strand mat over top of that both sides you", "8XLRvoRdYVE": "hello YouTube Bruno loose here with GLB productions back again with another video featuring our old friend the ex la 1,600 now after my video on how to connect a power amplifier I of course had many messages from you my lovely viewers say how do we connect a power amplifier in bridge mono mode and that's just what we're going to talk about today so stay tuned so before we learn about bridge mono mode and how to set up the amplify and connect it we need to understand bridge mono mode in the context of amplifier modes in general modern power amplifiers have two independent channels which are usually referred to as channel a and channel B now what's important to understand is that these are identical and they can be deployed in a number of different configurations including but not limited to left and right and this is what the modes help us to accomplish so all power amplifiers can be run in one of three different modes the simplest and the most straightforward is what is called stereo mode now in stereo mode the input signal to channel a is fed to the output of channel a and the input signal to channel B is fed to the output of channel B there is no interaction between the two channels and the level controls for channel a and B function independently this is called stereo mode because the most common application for it would be to feed the left signal of your mixer to channel a which is then used to power the left side of your PA system and feed the right output of your mixer to channel B which is then used to power the right side of the PA system so far so good good now the next mode which we commonly encounter is referred to as parallel mode sometimes this is referred to as parallel mano but on most amps it will just be called parallel mode in parallel mode the input to channel a is also fed to the input of channel B once again in parallel mode the input to channel a is also fed to the input of channel be the physical input of channel B is usually not used and this same signal is then output from channel a and channel B so you have one input signal which is then fed to both of the output channels the most common use of parallel mode is where you have a slightly larger system and perhaps you have four speakers on each side so you would use a single amplifier consisting of two channels to power one side of your PA system so you might have one amplifier for your right speakers and another amplifier for your left speakers so in this case you would feed the left signal from your mixing console for example to the input of channel a the amplifier would then internally split and route the signal to both channels before outputting that to all of your left speakers and you can see two speakers Illustrated here you could add more through daisy-chaining as is explained in my original amplifier video so this is parallel mode the third mode and the one which we are interested in in this video is referred to as bridge mode this is also called bridge mono mode do not confuse this with parallel mono they are different you have bridge mode or bridge mono mode now as you can see the signal routing on the input side is similar to that in parallel a single input signal connected to channel a is routed to the inputs of both channel a and B the physical input of channel B is not used the difference between bridge mode and parallel mode is that the polarity of channel B's output signal is inverted now in order to understand this statement you need to understand the amplifiers generate power which is then used to move speaker cones right and this is referred to as electro-motive force so the output of the amplifier is connected to the speaker when the amplifier produces a positive voltage the speaker cone moves forward usually and when the amplifier produces a negative voltage the amplifier cone moves backwards so if the positive voltage is analogous to pushing the amplifier cone and the negative voltage is analogous to pulling the amplifier cone what you have is two channels working in opposite directions to use that analogy so as you can see here when channel a is producing a positive voltage as illustrated by the curve going up channel B is producing a negative voltage as illustrated by the curve going down I've drawn the curve in red to make this clear similarly when channel a produces a negative voltage channel B produces a positive voltage the net effect of this is that you can connect this two channel amplifier to a single large loudspeaker often but not always a subwoofer and the end result of this is that when channel a pushes channel B pulls and when channel a pulls channel B pushes so as a result instead of having a single channel doing all the work you're now using both channels in effect combining the two channel amplifier into one large amplifier channel and that's why it's called bridge mono bridge because the input signal is bridged across both channels and mono because it effectively acts as a single amplifier channel now there are a couple of important things to understand about bridge mono mode firstly bridge mono gives roughly three times the output power into the same impedance as does one of the channels so to use the amplifier that is in front of us today the ECLA XL a 1600 does 450 watts into a ohms stereo into 8 ohms bridged it does 1520 watts so you can see that it's actually a bit more than three times under ideal circumstances you would get four times the power but there is loss in the power supply and other areas the other thing and this is the trade off the minimum output impedance is doubled so if an amplifier normally can operate down to four ohms per channel in bridge mono mode the amplifier can only operate down to eight ohms so you get three times the power but you can only drive double the impedance okay and it's very important that when you connect a power amplifier to a loudspeaker you do your mathematics carefully and check firstly that the loudspeaker can handle the power that it's being given because remember we're talking thousands of watts here and secondly that the amplifier can handle the impedance that it is being connected to in general you want to operate into 8 ohms when you are doing bridge mono amplifier manufacturers may say 4 ohms fine but for an extended period of time our experience is shown this doesn't always work out so well now that we understand how bridge mono mode works and what exactly we're doing to the amplifier when we configure it as such we can look at the mechanics of putting the amplifier into bridge mono mode to begin with I need to stress make sure that the amplifier is off and that all speakers are disconnected when you do the mode switch make sure the amplifier is off and that all speakers are disconnected the actual setting or the actual bridge mono mode switch is usually on the back of the amplifier as you can see we're looking at the back of the ECLA here and it's the bottom most of these three switches it may be a simple switch like this or it may be a series of dip switches some of the QSC amplifiers come to mind so this switch is recessed deliberately to prevent it being changed accidentally and as you can see it's stereo parallel and then bridge so use a small tool to move the switch in this case I'm just going to use a screwdriver so what I'm going to do is I'm going to push the switch from its bottom position it's now in parallel and I'm going to push it once more and it's now in bridge be very sure that when you do this you really do set it to bridge mono mode because if you don't then the results will not be what you expect it now that you've set the amplifier to bridge mode it's important to understand that you connect only one source and it is connected to channel one now on this amplifier the two channels are called one and two one is equivalent to a and two is equivalent to B so you would connect the source to channel one or channel a again make sure the amplifier is off when you are doing this do not connect anything to the other input now we're looking at the output side of the amplifier where the connections to the loudspeakers are so now that you've put the amplifier into bridge mono mode and you've connected your input it's time to connect your loudspeakers and this is where you really do need to consult the owners manual for the amplifier because every amplifier uses a slightly different protocol for connecting loudspeakers when you are in bridge mode in general there are three separate methods of doing this the first is that some amplifiers will have a dedicated bridge mono output so you can see on this particular amplifier you've got a channel 1 output which doubles as the bridge output and you've got a channel 2 output some amplifiers you will have a third speakon output which is labeled bridge or bridge mono output that is the best situation and in that case you use all your standard cabling and you simply connect to that output and you're good to go unfortunately most amplifier manufacturers will choose a cost-saving method that makes it necessary to use special cabling the second most common way which they do this is they use pins plus 2 and minus 2 on the channel 1 or channel a output so if you look carefully here you'll see that it says speak on one stereo one plus one minus Bridge two plus two minus now what does this mean in front of us we have the back of a new trick speakon connector now in order to accomplish this type of amplifier connection you need a speakon connector that has four holes some have only two this speak on is wired in the conventional manner the red cable is connected to plus 1 and blue cable is connected to -1 if you were to use this to make a bridge mono connection to this amplifier you would need to rewire the speak on such that the red was connected to this terminal which is the plus 2 terminal I think you can see the embossing there and the blue was connected to this terminal which is the minus to the other side of the cable would remain standard and it's very important that you not mix up the two ends of the cabling people always ask me if I have a speak on cable that's wired for bridge mono with plus 2 and minus 2 on one end and I reverse that cable will I damage something well the answer to that depends on how the speaker end is wired if your speaker is whyatt conventionally which is plus 1 and minus 1 you will just get no sound if you are unlucky and the speaker has the option for by amplification meaning that the tweeter is connected to plus 2 and minus 2 you'll probably damage something so anytime you rewire a speak on for bridge mono operation indicate somehow write down on the connector put a label on it so that people know that is why a plus 2 and minus 2 you have been warned now the last way or rather the third most common way of connecting to a bridge mono connection is to use these now these are called binding posts binding posts used to be the standard way of connecting bare wire to an amplifier before the speakon connector came along v as you can see the binding post correspond to the 2 channels you have here the positive terminal of channel 1 the negative of channel 1 and the positive and negative terminals of channel 2 when establishing a bridge mono action you will take your loudspeaker cabling and you would connect to the two red Center binding posts and the way you would do this is you would connect your red or your positive cable to the binding post of channel one and the blue or negative to the binding post of channel two and it should look something like that remember channel one is acting as the positive side and channel two is acting as the negative side so this is how you would connect using bare wire the other end would be speak on wired in the standard configuration or whatever connector your loudspeaker accepts so that's our video on how to connect a power amplifier in bridge mono mode I hope that this video was useful as always if you have questions or comments you can get

going to talk about connecting PEX tubing to copper pipe we will be using all half-inch pipe pieces as examples the fastest and easiest way to connect PEX directly to copper pipe is by using sharkbite connections these connections require no tools and no soldering if you aren't using sharp buy connections you will need a copper pipe adapter also known as a female sweat adapter the copper side will slide right over the copper pipe to be soldered you should do the soldering first to avoid any risk of damaging your pecs tubing you then connect your pecs tubing to the other side using one of the pecs connection options if you are connecting pecs to an existing fitting you will need to use a copper fitting adapter also known as a male sweat adapter this may be the case if your copper pipe is connected to an elbow or other type of fitting and you don't want to cut your pipe the copper side will slide right into the existing fitting to be soldered you then connect your pecs tubing to the other side using a pecs connection the main thing to remember is the difference between copper pipe adapters and copper fitting adapters copper pipe adapters slide over copper pipe while copper fitting adapters slide into existing fittings already on your pipes if you are connecting PEX to something with national pipe thread we also have male and female threaded adapters national pipe thread is a generic thread you can get at any store you simply screw on the threaded end and the pecs end will be connected using a pecs connection fittings are named based on the size of the pipe they work with copper pipe sizing refers to the inner diameter of the pipe for example a half-inch pipe adapter doesn't actually measure half-inch it simply fits over the half-inch copper pipe for more

of simple and practical way. This video shows our first approach the theme of the speakers. Proceadure The mission is to clean the basket of the speaker until it is bright and shiny. The first thing to do It is to remove the dust cap and check the status of the coil. As the coil is in poor condition, It is burned coil, we must make full reparation speaker. we cut the cone with a scalpel.\u00ad Then we cut the spider, also known as membrane. We cut the voice coil lead wire We remove the set and we show that the coil is completely destroyed. Now remove the cone press using the scalpel. This should be done carefully, to avoid scratching the speaker basket. We remove waste of the spider Be careful when using the scalpel,, any carelessness can cause an accident. It is important  cover the slot where will go coil, with masking tape. In this way We isolate this area of  liquid and waste, while we are washing the speaker. As the idea is that the speaker basket  not mistreat, Toluene must apply over waste that they have been attached in the suspension surround and the glue in the speaker basket. The same we do with waste spider. We waited a few minutes for the toluene to dissolve the glue and then remove with ease. That way there not to scratch the speaker basket. The scalpel is used smoothly and only to remove debris and unattached by the action of toluene. Apply more toluene And we continue cleaning until the speker basket is completely free of glue or fragment of cone or the spider. It gives the last bath of toluene and clean completely  with a dry cloth or a napkin. We removed the masking tape of the slot where it is located the coil. The speaker terminals also they should be cleaned. They are heated whit soldering iron and removed pieces of the speaker flex lead wire. It should melt all possible welding, for that we give small thuds, until the terminal is clean. The terminal holes They should be open. because the slot where the coil is located is filled with metal particles And even when the coil is burned, It must be cleaned by hand, using a small trowel or strip of acetate paper of radiograph, of such a width which fits into the groove of the coil. Then cut a strip of masking tape width the same of the acetate paper and should be wrapped on the  acetate paper strip, with the glue toward outside. then  passed the palette with masking  tape by into the slot, forming circles, collecting dirt and others who are there.. This is repeated as often as necessary, until no no dirt on the masking tape. In our speaker We use a 4-layer coil in aluminum support and an impedance of 6 ohms, which it is very similar which originally had the speaker. as we see the coil fits perfectly into the slot; by gravity, without trancarse when released. Now we make the \"centralizers\" with strips of acetatepaper of  radiography. For this case cut strips 1.5 cmts wide. Then cut transversely. The length of the strips must be equal or should be greater than the height of the coil Now we measure the width of the area where the wire is wound in the ring coil. This value is divided in 4. So a quarter of the coil, It should be left out of the slot in the speaker basket. Now we place the strips of acetate or centralizers. They are placed one after the other, but they  unmounted one above the other. We put the coil directing their wires to the terminals. The coil is pushed gently to certain determined depth. We measure the spider hole; Generally should enlarge so that the coil between adjusted. Adjust the edges using the scalpel. Then we measure the cone and we find the surprise that the coil does not reach into the cone. Therefore we are forced lengthen the collar of the coil. Then we proceed to prepare epoxy resin. are mixed equal parts of components, and stir until a homogeneous paste. We use abundant resin in the collar of the coil, on the role of reinforcement. Then we apply resin in the Kraft Paper, which serve to extend the collar of the coil. It sticks the kraft paper wound two turns around the coil collar, making sure it is tight and well straight. applied resin over the kraft paper, to give rigidity and let dry. Now re-test the height of the coil, we see that it voice coil enters the cone and  achieving the perfect height. apply  abundant yellow contact cement on the edge of the spider. This glue is the same used in the shoe workshop. We apply the same glue on the edge of the speaker basket, which it is the site where the spider rests. Let dry the contact glue enough time, as for their gases evaporate. This is verified to the touching the glue with your finger, without being daub. We put the spider, pressing the edges of the hole with the scalpel. The spider must come down  without deforming, Note that if you press too much or too little, will move the correct location of the coil. sticking area with a scalpel or a thin object is pressed. This is essential to ensure good adhesion. now stuck  spider to the speaker basket, We proceed to paste it to the coil. This is done using the quick-drying epoxy resin. To stick the coil to the spider we should spread the glue around these, with a thin wooden stick. The glue should be even and without spilling. When finished applying the resin, we must flip the speaker with his front down, to prevent the glue go into the slot, gluing the coil with the speaker basket, this ruins our work. We proceed to measure the cone suspension surround and determine the limit; as far as applying glue on the speaker basket, so it does not look like a stain. apply abundant black contact cement on the verge of sorround suspension, It also applies contact cement on the edge delimited in the speaker basket, where it shall adhere cone suspension. Once the glue is dry Carefully place the cone that the suspension is well centered. Then with the fingers pressed both sides, turning the speaker, to paste the entire suspension. To stick the cone with the voice coil, we must apply epoxy resin in their union. Practice makes the master. Every day our finishes should be better. The glue should not be much but enough, the idea is to achieve a molten bead between the two elements to be joined. As a plastic cone and the speaker will be used as subwoofer, the speaker will have a heavy workload, why we must strengthen bottom, at the junction of the cone with the collar of the coil. After the glue has dried, We take the  wire ends of the background coil, YAnd remove the strips of acetate or centralizers. Pressing the cone with thumbs, must move smooth up and down, if we have assembly alright, the coil will not present any friction. With a hot tip, proceed to make a couple of holes, where they will spend the the wire braids. Through a hole cross the wire braid. from back to  forth and return it by the other hole. tinned both ends of the wire braid to cross easily through the holes in the terminals. Cut the tinned part, we introduce each end  tinned in its respective terminal hole. the wire braids are placed in the open position, to not have friction with cone or the spider, generating noises. being inclined is welded to the terminal. On the front of the speaker we cut the wire braid in the center. returned a bit the wire braid We take the tip wire ofthe  voice coil and we twist the wire braid. we tin-plate cut the surplus wire, and the wire braid surplus. Shrink back the wire braid, undergirding the wire at the cone. We do the same with the other wire and the other wire braid. We prepare epoxy resin, To protect the splice, cover with epoxy resin. Let dry for 10 minutes. bottom of cone we apply resin at the outputs of the wire braids. the wire braids should be loose so that when moving the speaker, not present tensions and then break Nor they should be very long lest friction with spider or cone, generating annoying noise. Finally place the dust cap. Applies black cement  contact in the edge of the dust cap,, paying close attention, sticks well centered over the cone. Then we put a heavy element, for further tightening. The glue we use in this work, require a minimum of 24 hours to reach its maximum strength; ensuring quality. Therefore any soundcheck You should expect this reasonable time. Now we hear the sound test live. howdy friends! Here the speaker that we have repaired In this speaker we did an overhaul we did a change everything the cone, the suspension, the voice coil, and wire braids. We see that the speaker is well It does not have any friction in the coil And let's listen to see how  its sound. Here teneo a audio signal, From an amplifier To achieve a sound as it should be We must put it in a acoustic box Now  the speaker the sound should give If tightens obviously going to sound better As

anyway so got a story for you today involving weed and I actually was tweeting on Twitter last night and some kid told me if the MLG stream went back up I faced one the MLG streams and vs. optic I had to make a story that was crazy so they did phase up and now I'm gonna make this so okay I got this story to tell and before you guys start commenting saying I'm a scumbag for this let me explain what happened and why it happened so in many previous stories I would tell you guys about how this kid tried to break into my house and it's the same kid am i fighting off a robber story it is the same exact person so he was selling at the time and now I'm gonna explain what happened so this happened okay probably like half a year ago I wasn't even smoking at the time this is the funny thing so this was actually kind of recently you know people usually tell me that my stories are all really old well this is kind of recent so this kid was kind of a you know he's still the same douchebag that he's always been but um I kind of got to know him a little bit I I have his phone number now and I talked to him once in a while and he was on this period of time where he was selling weed so my one friend was buying from him on the frequent occasion so my one friend and me were hanging out one day on this Main Street and he told me he's like I want to buy some weed I was like okay we're gonna call up cuz I know a lot of the connections around here and he was like all I'm gonna call up this kid and I'm not gonna say his name he might watch this because you know he follows me on Twitter but um he so he says his name I was like dude I don't think that's a good idea this kid might like robbed you or something he's a sketchy-ass kid and he was like nah nah he's good he's good and I'm like all right dude suit yourself so he pulls out his phone and calls this kid and he was at the kid was asking so who's with you well who's with you and he told he told him he's like yeah this he's like Austin's with me and he was like Oh Mike well he said Perry cuz you guys know I'm called Perry to idiots like girl Perry's with me and I was and I was like yeah what's up it he's like alright I'll be there in a minute so he picks us both up we're driving around the block and he's doing this deal and this kid like my friend I think he bought like a little over an eighth like maybe even like an eighth and a half I don't even know how much that is I don't know [ __ ] about weed like any like with prices and weighing I don't know anything I used to say bring me 40 bring me 60 like that's what I used to say to my dealer so the connect came through like I said when we were driving and my friend gave him the $40 and this kid completely cheaped him out he gave him like a dub straight up like it was literally like not even a gram a no joke this kid paid like forty to fifty bucks and he gave him like under a dub and he was like yo what is this and the kids like what that's that's what you paid for and he's like nah this is such a ripoff give me my money back he's like nah Deal or No Deal and just like get the [ __ ] out so let me I forgot to tell you guys this kid doesn't Drive he was with hit like an 18 year old so you know we weren't gonna [ __ ] with this kid like my friend was an 18 he was my age and I'm my age so we can't we can't fight off at 18 year old and a scumbag so you know I just got home like yo you're mad shady for doing this we both got out so my one friend got the squad together and he called up like six kids like no joke my friend called the squad up and this whole group of kids is alright I you call him we're gonna get this kid down here and we're all gonna get it so my one friend called up this kid this kids like he ran a whole operation he would sell the weed and then give like a quarter of the money to the kid who drove him around to the customers so we called up this kid and I straight-up was just like why not me my one friend who I was sitting next to was like yo I'm not gonna say I'm gonna call him John for example he's like yo John I need an ounce of this and he was like everything say of this but he's like I need out and he's like all right I got you meet me here at 8:30 p.m. so at this point we're sitting here and we're waiting and it's like three hours go by because it was like 5:30 when we called them so we had to wait awhile and we went to the location he told us to meet him at and when we get there we see the car sitting there and here was the plan guys my friend was gonna get in the car we were gonna circle the car so he couldn't drive away and my friend was gonna take it and leave so we had this pretty much down we weren't gonna let some kid rob us and we were like we had a feeling he was trying to rob us but we got there and the kid actually had a an ounce a little under an ounce he was kind of trying to he was kind of trying to [ __ ] us off again so we get there and me and my friend get in the car and right when we get in the car all of our friends jump out of like the hiding places and circle the car and he's like you know what the [ __ ] going on and my friends like give me the weed and he's like what he's like give me the [ __ ] weed and he's like nah you're Shady I'm not giving you [ __ ] and he was like give me the weed now and the minute he said that the kid just threw it over the seat and my friend caught it immediately jumped out of the car and walked away and I jumped out of the car too and my friend quickly put it in his backpack because you know you don't want any security seeing what's going on because we were right by a convenience store and you know you don't want to give away location and all that [ __ ] so we got out of the car and we run all of my friends we all just run there's like seven of us and I don't even know how many there were there were a lot of people with us friends of friends so you know we ran away the kid was pissed he tried to jump my friend but uh that this was in the future afterwards but if I wanted to get that kid who we robbed he wanted to get revenge so my friend that kid who he robbed tried to jump my friend and it was just a whole [ __ ] shindig of bull so I mean that was basically the story don't get it mixed up with the wrong crowd guys but um that was pretty all over the place I'm sorry if some parts are kind of hard to follow but um anyway by the way guys I'm not forgetting to shout out donators I'm just wait there's a certain number I'm trying to get and not not with money I'm like after like every five donations I shut out those five people so tomorrow's video I'm gonna shut out all the recent donors if you want to donate links in the description but anyway guys thank you for watching thank you all for the positive

we just bought one of these the bigger the bigger containers of them so it has a ton of juice in here and if you're wondering what they look like when they come it's just in this nice little white box here so when yeah let's let's go ahead and open up and I'll just show you quickly how to uh just how to rig them so it comes it starts with a nice watertight little compartment here let me just pull that thing off he's on there pretty darn good yeah definitely no water getting out of there so we'll pull that thing off and toss that out because yeah this whatever kind of juice is in here is just potent but it sure is amazing as far as fishing so so here they are again they're just just free-floating in there what we're going to do is we're going to I'll show you how to put it onto this jig head and this is actually jig head made by gulp that in the style of it is specific for the type of material that this is from these little tiny ridges hold it amazingly well so you can catch a whole lot more fish per goal when you use a jig head like this so as far as rigging it it's really standard with any any kind of soft plastic where you want them to be you want them to look natural or you if it's all curved like that it's just going to helicoper so you want it to look perfectly natural and to do that obviously you want the top of the gulp to end up all the way at the base of the jig head so I kind of you know put it on the side just to match and you can see where my thumb is my thumb is marking the spot where it would naturally come out so I keep that marked with my thumb right there and then through the top we'll just go straight from the top make sure we get dead center from the top all the way down and it will come out directly on the top of the bait right where my thumb was marking so always want to make sure that this hook point is coming out through the middle and now that we've confirmed that it is we can just shift the debate up to the up to hook and this thing is on here good there we are so there's the there's the shrimp again this this thing will wear this thing will swim real nice in the water you can see it's perfectly straight actually if anything I was a little bit off you can see it's not quite perfectly in the middle I personally would actually redo it to make sure it's in the middle but you'll get the idea from from this clip so this is it recommend this this type of hook with these gold drug baits I start with these gulp shrimp and and it definitely will be a great bait for you to catch some awesome inshore fish whether it's smoked redfish and trout so hope you enjoy you have any questions let us know otherwise stay tuned we'll do some more reviews", "p7E50pN3dKE": "concept series 10 ply maple shell 5.5 x 13 8 two-sided dual

of the metric system in general and then we're going to talk about how to convert from one unit to another within the metric system so the first thing you need to remember is that the metric system is based on 10 1 x 10 10 x 10 100 times 10 but the bottom line is it's based on 10 the system we currently currently use in the United States isn't based on 10 in fact it's not really based on any one number if you take an inch and you look on a ruler and you look at the small divisions for a ruler you'll either find that an inch is based on 8 or 16 individual pieces and if you take a foot you'll see that it's broken down into 12 individual units we call inches next bigger than a foot is a yard and that's broken down into either three pieces three feet or 36 pieces 36 inches but it's not based on anything nice and same like the metric system is based on series of tens the metric system really doesn't involve any fractions you may see it as one over ten but to me that's point one or 1/10 you may see something says 1 over 100 but to me that's 1/100 the metric system is always used also used by people throughout the world we're one of three countries that does not use the metric system and frankly I think it's much easier to use the metric system than the system we use currently the metric system is made up of a series of prefixes and root words and the prefixes are pretty easy to remember if you remember this mnemonic device or this memory assistive device King Henry died unexpectedly drinking chocolate milk now I don't know why it works for other people but I and I don't know why it works for me but I can tell you this from the time I was a child I found that using pneumonic devices helped me tremendously remember things that otherwise would have just been random bits and pieces of information or letters for some reason when I was when I was younger I had a hard time remembering how to spell the word geography no matter what I did I just really struggled with how to spell that word until I realized there was a delightful pneumonic device or memory assistive device that I could use and that statement was george e's old grandfather rode a pony home yesterday now why i could remember that sentence and not the individual letters i don't know but it helped me a lot and hopefully this mnemonic device will help you too King Henry died unexpectedly drinking chocolate milk there's other pneumonic devices that you can use for the metric prefixes and if you know of one that you use that works for you please share it in the comment section under this video because if it works for you it will probably help somebody else and I may even like it more than my chocolate milk pneumonic device so when you're converting from one metric unit to the other the first thing that you want to do is draw a horizontal line just draw a line it doesn't have to be perfect it doesn't even have to be straight it just needs to be there and on the horizontal line you're going to put seven tick marks kind of like seven days of the week that's how I remember how many to put now you'll notice that I make the one in the middle of the fourth one larger you don't have to I do but that's totally up to you as to whether you want to make that a larger line or not then above each of the individual tick marks you write the abbreviations for the mnemonic K for King H for Henry D for died you for unexpectedly D for drinking C for chocolate and M for milk underneath the U I put these letters to help me remember what my root words are the metric system you don't have to put those if you don't want to it just helps me so what do those letters stand for well M is the abbreviation for meter and sometimes it's spelled with an e are at the end and sometimes it's spelled with an re in the United States we use the ER spelling and a meter is the standard measure for length it's a little bigger than a than a yard little bigger than a yard but it's the measurement of length M L and it's uppercase L not lowercase L it looks like a capital L that's the abbreviation for leader again there's two spellings of it we prefer the e.r spelling of leader leader is the standard measure for volume you probably already know that because you drink pop from a two-liter bottle so you're familiar with the with the unit leader and the fact that it's volume G is the abbreviation for Graham and Graham is the root word or the base word for the SI unit for mass but it's not what the standard is based on a gram weighs a paperclip weighs about a gram a nickel which is five cents weighs about five grams that's an easy way to remember what a gram is is however kilogram is the standard measure for mass not the gram gram is simply the base word kilogram is a measure for mass not for weight there's a difference and in the metric system we specify mass probably more frequently than we specify weight so what are the prefixes mean K remember we said King here's our letters King Henry died unexpectedly drinking chocolate milk k is for kilo and kilo is the same thing as saying a thousand if I said I had a kilo of pizzas I would have a thousand pizzas if I said I had a kilo of students I would have a thousand students kilo dollars a thousand dollars kilo means a thousand and it's used quite a bit H is for Hector hecto stands for 100 we don't use that on a fairly regular basis but you need to know that how though is the prefix that means 100 deca can be spelled two ways de ca\u00f1a or Deka and that means 10 and i find that pretty easy to remember because a decade is 10 years Dec Dec is 10 the abbreviation for deca is either DK or da both mean deca hecto the abbreviation is H kilo the abbreviation is K U is for unit that's where you have your root word so it would be meter liter or gram deci with an eye at the end means 1/10 senti with an eye at the end is 1/100 that one's also pretty easy for me to remember because I think about the word cent in the word centi and I realize there's a hundred cents in a dollar or one cent is 1/100 of a dollar and milli is one one thousand now the way I remember that these are the smaller units is because they all end in I so does the word Mini Mini ends in the letter I and these end in I and many many to me is small and these are small so that's how you remember they're less than one so here's my metric slider King Henry died unexpectedly drinking chocolate milk with the meter the leader and the gram again to put these together km would be kilo meter H L would be hecto liter da or DK G would be deca gram deci leader sent a leader and Milly leader so how do you use the metric slider first of all you're going to start with a number you're always going to be given a number like how many centimeters are in 127 millimetres sometimes the decimal is showing when you're giving that given that information and sometimes it's not if it's not showing you can go ahead and put a decimal to the right of the last number it's there it's invisible but when you're using the metric slider you need to make it visible then you're going to add some extra zeros you're going to add some extra zeros before the number you're going to add some extra zeros after the number and that's so that when you're using your metrics later you have some room to work then you're going to look at the unit for the known quantity in your problem so if you're going from centimetres to millimetres the known quantity is centimeters 127 centimeters you're going to put your pointer on centi then you're going to move to the new unit in this case we're moving from senti to milli and we're going to count both the number of jumps and the direction that we go we're going to pay attention to the direction we go and count the number of jumps and then we're going to move our decimal in the original number the same number of spaces and in the same direction as we moved our pointer on the metric slider so let's do an example how many millimeters are in 57 centimeters so the number we're starting out with is 57 we're going from centimetres to millimetres so we're going to write the 57 we're going to show the decimal we're going to add extra zeros use our slider to put the pointer on the first unit the starting unit in this case centi and count the number of jumps and notice the direction needed to get to milli so here's what it looks like 57 centimeters there's my decimal my extra zeros to the right it's still 57 now if you know significant figures you know we've changed the significant figures but we haven't changed the value of the 57 add some more zeros eventually you'll realize that you only need to add zeros either at the end of a number or at the beginning of a number but when you're first starting out just good technique to add them in both there's my metric slider I'm going to start it senti and move to milli so I'm moving one jump to the right if I add this and move one jump to the right my decimal goes from after the 7 to after the zero so 57 centimeters is five hundred and seventy millimeters let's do another example 14.90 two liters is how many kilo liters what are you going to do first to solve this problem pause the tape now and talk to someone around you or write down what your first step is going to be to solve this problem hopefully you did pause the tape because you're going to use your slider to find out the answer and there's a slider we're going to start on liters now if you'll notice none of these says el l\u00edder went under our units or our root word column we're going to go from liters to kilo so let's count one two three to the left and indeed three jumps to the left one four point nine two liters becomes point zero one four nine two kiloliters ready for another one here we go next example 7250 centiliters is how many kilo liters pause the video now you can use your metric slider talk to someone that's around you and see if you can figure out the conversion I'm sure you did great using your metric converter so we're going from sin T to kilo centi is right here kilo is right here let's count one two three four five jumps to the left five jumps to the left we're going to move our decimal in the original number the same number of spaces and the same direction that we move the slider so let's give it a try one two three four five jumps to the left we added these two zeros here as placeholders we don't really need this first one but sometimes it makes it a little bit easier to read so 7250 centiliters is point zero seven two five zero kilo liters here's some independent practice for you forty-five thousand grams is how many milligrams once you stop the video now use your metric slider and figure out the answer to that one forty five thousand grams is forty-five million milligrams three jumps to the right I'm sure you did that right here's some more for you to practice on your own let me know if you have any trouble with them", "MHQCqnoTBXM": "a lot of folks write us looking for advice on wood fillers they want to know what they should use when they're trying to fill a nail hole or a gouge or even a crack in a piece of wood and it's a good question Tommy because there are a lot of options out there paintable sustainable water-based epoxies what do we use well it really depends on whether you're inside the house or outside the house whether you're going to paint the wood or stain the wood all right well let's say that we are inside the house and we're going to paint the water we've got a piece right here of crown molding it has not been painted we've got some nail holes how do I handle these well you can use a vinyl spackle right here you can use a water based wood filler right here just fill a hole but you always want to overfill the hole so it will shrink down when you sand it and the idea here is that because we sand this smooth and then paint it it's pretty forgiving and so what we choose isn't that important right sometimes what I like to do is I'll actually take a piece of wood like this with some sawdust from the wood and I'll actually take my glued fill the void or the hole even a nail hole fill it up till in this case you're going to make your own filler make my own filler take the sawdust put it into the wet glue and mix it around forcing it into that crack see I'm actually making a little paste yep and then when that sets up when that sets up I'll take my sander and sand it and that crap will disappear well that's a nice tip all right now let's say we're going to stain this piece of wood right here so it's clear now we want to fill the hold we want to make sure we get a nice even color right well if you're going to stain it you want to make sure you give a filler that's stainable as a solvent base and a water base they're both stainable and they both set up pretty quick okay now if we've got a piece of wood that is already stained and we want to get a nice color match and we've got a let's say a nail hole in this guy right well you can actually use these crayons right here that you skim over the hole you've got to try to match the color and you skim over the hole with that and then you brush it in and then wipe it off with a rag piece of wood over here you try to find one that will match the wood you rub it in fill a hole keep filling it right up yeah and then you rub it with a rag and polish it right off you got some of that sawdust left over from your last experiment on there okay another that we can use in addition to crayons yeah there's oil-based putties that you can get and they actually take a couple of these or three of them whatever it takes and mix them together until you get the color that you want gotcha all right now let's say we've got ourselves a big crack or a gouge putty is not going to be sufficient well if it's inside and you're going to paint the wood you can use a bondo auto body filler works great now why do you say if it's inside because if you use this outside this becomes very hard and it doesn't expand and contract with the wood and it can break away so inside the wood doesn't move that much but outside the wood moves a lot right and filler like a bondo is no good right so in that case there's a two-part epoxy right here that's very flexible and it's meant for wood and here's a piece right here that we've passed the corner on a shudder then you can also use it to fill holes and cracks and voids and make moldings out now you're saying that if this was a bondo this would be too hard so if this would move to pop that right off a scent a big crack feel crack and it will eventually fall off now how do we work with this it'd take a long time to set up can we sand it this takes a day or two depending on the weather for it to dry and then you're ready to work with it okay and we also see a lot of plastic outside now PVC PVC trim is great because it holds up to the weather sure here's a couple of screw holes right here here's one that I've already filled and there's one that I'm going to fill but this is actually a two-part acrylic that comes in a tube it actually mixes inside the tube sets up very quickly it's great for an adhesive also alright so you put it in there and how quickly is it going to set up if I put this in here it's going to be set in five minutes you see it mixing right in the tube there yep so that's two parts coming together and I won't overfill it uh-huh all right now here's one here that I've overfilled wait about 15 minutes take my sand well now that's a pretty good color match you could probably just leave that right now if you paint it it'll disappear I look great as well Thank You Tommy my pleasure", "QhdtcazJELU": "I did a show back in

pick what unit you want to use to measure whether it's grams ounces fluid ounces or milliliters now if the item needs to be weighed in a container that's no problem simply place the container on the scale touch the tare button which is the same as the on button and you will see the scale zero out then just add the food item and you will see that the scale weighs just the food you can also weigh food directly on the scale simply choose the unit of measurement you want then place the item on the scale and there you go you can even measure fluid ounces or milliliters simply zero out the weight of the container with the tare button and then pour the liquid cleanup is easy too since there's no actual buttons the surface is smooth and made a strong tempered glass all you have to do is wipe it

seen my first sugaring video and in that video I failed to mention that what we're doing here is actually making candy so yes we are waxing with caramel but let's start from the beginning so when I first started making this sugar I didn't know what I was doing in fact I butchered it so many times that that's why I had to make that video because I wanted you all to know the things I wish I knew when I first started and the way that I finally figured it out was I cooked my sugar to a Pacific color that gave me consistent results every time I realized that that just ain't enough so I researched and I finally got some answers and as it turns out what I didn't realize is that I was actually cooking my sugar to a very specific stage so long story short cooking your sugars to a specific temperature is going to allow you to reach different stages in this candy making process there's softball firm ball hard ball and so on and so forth and also I should mention these temperatures may vary slightly depending on where you live in the world so the process is gonna be the same as in the first video step 1 mix your sugar water and lemon juice to put them on medium to high heat and step 3 after your mixture starts to bubble you want to insert a thermometer just make sure that it's not touching the bottom and that it's at least about an inch into the liquid because this is gonna give you the most accurate reading if you of you did ask me for recommendations for what type of pan you should use to make this sugar and I would recommend a saucepan and the taller the better because as your sugar bubbles unless you have to worry about it over flowing and most importantly you don't have to stir it and again do make sure that you've removed the sugar from the range as soon as it reaches the right temperature here I have two cups of dry sugar versus two cups of sugar a quarter cup of lemon juice and a quarter cup of water just so you guys can see the volume difference and of course when you cook it it will reduce further because we're just burning off the water now in case you guys didn't know I also made a sugar FAQ video to answer all of your questions about the original video in that video I told you about a method that I call the poor in store this is when you pour your sugar into a container and use it later after it's completely cool so you're not handling it while it's hot at all now this sugar that you're seeing here I cook to 240 degrees Fahrenheit or 116 degrees Celsius and as you can see it's pretty firm however I made this sugar a week ago that's right this sugar set for seven days but it's still pliable so this is what's referred to as a cold sugar but it's more like room temperature now you can still need it to make it a little softer and elastic however do keep in mind that you can use the cold wax straight out of the jar as is because as you wax your body heat and the temperature of the room will warm the sugar up and make it just as elastic as it is right now and I would call this recipe a soft wax compared to my next batch which is this one this sugar I cooked to 250 degrees Fahrenheit color was very similar however the firmness of the sugar once it set was a little bit harder so I'm gonna call this sugar firm and the last sugar I cooked a hard stage which as you can see is thicker than a bowl oatmeal as you can imagine makes it very difficult to remove from the container from this batch that I couldn't even scoop I took a small piece and I needed it the day before and as you can see it's still really soft in fact I showed you my sugar in this stage in the first video so long story short if you were wondering well if I didn't have to knead this then why did you tell me to that's the reason why because by kneading the sugar and you come back to it it won't be a solid piece of candy and you might be asking yourself why would you need to wax that hard is because firmer works better in hotter temperatures so if you are someone who lives in a really hot and humid climate the firmer sugars are gonna be the best for you and remember what I said about us making candy well what happens to candy when you leave it in your pocket that's right it gets soft and really melting and if it's hot enough of course it's gonna turn into a syrup just like it did when we boiled it but if you want to spare your fingers and not need it while it's hot you can just use a wax warmer that you guys might have noticed that I've changed the container that I've been storing my sugar in and one of those reasons is because it fits perfectly into a standard sized wax warmer just keep in mind that it is slightly taller so I don't think that the bottom is touching the metal conduction but it still warms it all the way through so just to reiterate again you can make your sugar to whatever consistency you think will be the easiest for you to work with so this is how I make a soft firm and hard cold wax this is a sugar that I undercooked it still has a lot of water content and the way that I know that is because when I go to spread it onto my skin when I apply the strip to remove it it actually soaks through and this is a non cloth wax strip also know if it's undercooked it because as you can see it has barely pulled any hair out and I know this might be a little bit difficult to see because my hair is pretty fine but that's what happens after you've been waxing for a while do you see how it's separating this isn't even close to being a pace this is a serum now this is a sugar that I also undercooked however you'll notice there's a huge color difference and this one is also not as runny technically this is also a syrup but it's a thicker one and unlike the one I just showed you you can still use this so you just want to thinly apply it to the skin and use a wax strip and it removed all the hair when you guys are kneading your sugar you want to make sure that you're not using too much water and you'll know that you're using too much because this starts to happen one of the tell-tale signs is that your fingers will be covered in syrup it will be really glossy because it's becoming very runny looks like it wants to convert back to a liquid state and the more water you add the worse it gets so remember guys we are making candy we're working with sugar and what a sugar do in water it dissolves save the excess water for tea and coffee but of course if you're using the cold pace there's no water needed since I am trying to fit a lot of information into these pretty short videos I can make another video if you guys would like me to on how you apply sugar and how to use it cold and warm hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please do give it a thumbs up because it really lets me know what you guys want to see more of and make sure that you share it cuz sharing is caring and I'll see you guys next week in the next video bye", "B-AOAAkUqlk": "hi everyone I'm Shawn Smith I'm a general contractor and I'm here to show you how to install go board if you've never tiled anything before you might not know that you need a durable waterproof surface under your tile called a tile backerboard today I'm going to show you how easy it is to get your space completely ready for tile with a new product from Johns Manville this is go board it's extremely durable but it's about 80% lighter than traditional cement backer boards that means it's easier to carry plus it cuts cleaner than cement boards so it's also easier to clean up your workspace after you're done go board is also great because it's inherently waterproof which means fewer products to buy and less time to install let's get started this is the bathroom that I'll be tiling I'm focusing on the walls of the shower and the surrounding floor today but go board can be used in all kinds of tiling applications around the home including the kitchen laundry room the basement and of course everywhere in your bathrooms it can go into commercial buildings as well basically you can use go board anywhere you want to tile first I'm going to measure the space and create my project plan a project plan is a great way to keep yourself organized I'm going to take the measurements of the area that I'm going to tile and keep track of them on my project plan drawing now that I have my measurements I can fill out my shopping list so I can make sure to buy everything I need in one trip let's start with go board go board comes in two sizes half inch and quarter inch the half inch board is for walls showers ceilings and floors use the quarter inch boards for the floors and countertops today I'm going to be using the quarter inch board for the floors and the half inch board for the walls and I need to either galvanized roofing nails or backer board screws dry set mortar and polyurethane sealant to fasten bond and seal go board to complete your shopping list you'll need to make sure you have the right tools in addition to your products you can download the full installation instructions and product list from JM comm I've already done some prep work to this shower that you'll need to do before you start your project I removed all the fixtures nearby electrical outlets trim the old tile and setting materials you can see that I'm down to the wall studs and insulation and the subfloor evaluate your wall studs and sub floors you're looking for signs of mold and if you need to make any repairs ensure your subfloor is in good condition and replace any sections as needed check for any squeaks or loose boards and install additional fasteners as needed you might need to shim or replace your studs if they're bowed so you have a completely flat wall and if your studs are spaced greater than 16 inches on center you need to add additional studs to prep for shower pan installation follow the manufacturer's instructions for the drain location and any wall prep you also might need to reroute plumbing and electrical if you've changed the layout of your room finally you'll need to mask the doorway and your studs once all of the prep work is done and turn off power to the room if you have any questions about what you need to do this safely prep your space please ask a professional now that all the prep is done I can get started first I'll measure for the first board placement to ensure it fits snugly at the base up against the shower pan you might have to make some adjustments depending on what kind of shower pan you're using but just follow the shower pan instructions take your piece of go board and lay it on any flat and herbal surface like this vanity then measure it and draw your cut line with a pen or pencil whatever you have handy will work just fine score your line with your utility knife bend the board at the edge of your surface and snap off the piece you need now I'll position the first piece along the corner wall of the shower and pre mark my start position so I know where to attach it then I'll take my polyurethane sealant and apply it to the bottom edge of my piece of NGO board then fasten it to the studs at the wall base I need to apply enough of it so that it squeezes out at the side when I fasten go board to this done I'll show you why in a minute take a look at the dot pattern on NGO board that tells me which way faces outward today I'm going to use a drill and backer board screws to fasten NGO board to the studs but you can also use a nail gun if you have wood studs if you use a drill remember to use one and a quarter inch backer board screws if you decide to use a nail gun you can use one and a half inch galvanized roofing nails instead now I'm going to fasten my NGO board to the studs make sure your nails or screws are flush with the surface of the NGO board they need to be a maximum of six inches apart and within a half inch to one inch of the edge if you use a nail gun be sure to use a lower pressure setting so the nails don't break through the top face err it's normal for some nails to be raised above the board surface so just hammer them flush next I'm going to do a circular cut to go around my plumbing it's the same process as a straight line measure for placement and location around your fixtures then place the go board on your flat surface measuring and drawing a circular cut line is a little trickier than a straight edge but you can make dots to form the size of the circle you need then complete it with your pen you can also use a compass to get a more precise round shape cut NGO board with your utility knife using multiple passes to cut through the bull be sure to do a dry fit of your cut-go board pieces especially around fixtures before you put the polyurethane sealant on to attach my next piece of cut-go board I first need to apply my polyurethane sealant to the top edge of the first board using enough sealant to squeeze out position the second piece and but it against the first board leaving a small gap of approximately 1/8 of an inch then nail or screw in place remember go board is inherently waterproof but any edge and place where the nails or screws go in must be sealed to protect the whole system against water damage and mold now I'm going to take my putty knife and spread the excess sealant on the top and bottom edges of the first board to get a tight seal do that for every edge joint and fastener location double check all joints and fastener locations to ensure you have complete coverage and no small pinholes that's it you just have to keep repeating this process until your entire wall surface area to be tiled is finished now I'll show you how to fasten go board two floors it's important to do a pre check and make sure your fits are good with the go board and the best thing about this product there's no extra steps it's one cut with a utility knife with something like a cement backer board you'd have to get a grinder you'd be making a ton of mess but with this there's only one piece of scrap and no waste no mess to clean up four floors before you attach go board there's the added step of applying thin set mortar directly to any clean dry and flat subfloor I'm going to mix my mortar until it's the consistency of peanut butter this is what I'm looking for now I'll take my notched trowel and apply and comb the mortar I just want to apply enough at a time for one piece of go board otherwise it'll set up before I can get the board down then take your piece of go board and press it into the mortar be sure to leave an eighth inch space between all the corners and edges to help prevent cracks due to movement in the structure after tiling next I'm going to fasten the go board to the floors using the same method as the walls either backer board screws or roofing nails however if you have a concrete floor you can skip this step after I'm done fastening go board to my entire floor surface I'm going to make sure my joints edges and fastener locations are waterproofed so we're using mesh tape here to tie the two boards together to make it one structural system and one good tip here when you're putting the mortar down you want it nice and flat so it doesn't make any protrusions when you're putting tile down I'm going to take my liquid waterproofing membrane and my paint brush and apply two heavy coats that extend at least one inch beyond the mortar be sure to follow the manufacturer instructions for drying times between coats and tiling inspect the coverage after each coat to make sure there are no holes or gaps even the smallest pinhole can result in a leak well that's it we're done as you can see it's easy to complete a tile project with go board whether you're working on a new house or getting a facelift to your current home", "-MY-101VAxA": "in this problem you are asked to convert four ounces to some amount of milliliters I'm going to solve this problem using dimensional analysis and also using a proportion if you would like to jump ahead to the dimensional analysis you're welcome to click right on the dimensional analysis here that should take you to that point or if you'd like to see it solved with a proportion click right here on the word proportion and that would take you to when I solved it using that what I'm going to do first is list some things that we need to know and then I'm going to start with a quick graphic representation of how we can solve this problem one thing that we absolutely need no matter which particular procedure we're using is the conversion factor from ounces to milliliters this is on your formulas and and measurements and conversions to memorize if you have lost that worksheet I'm sure it's available in the learning resources or you can contact one of the math instructors here at PA College and we would be able to email that to you if you look on that what you're going to find is you're going to see ounces a few different times one is in terms of volume and the other is in terms of weight how do I know which one I'm using am I using ounces to a certain weight or ounces to a certain volume that is easily answered by looking at what we are converting it to we are asked to solve for ounces find its equivalent equivalents in milliliters liters is a measure of volume this is a measure of volume we are looking for I immediately know and we do see that here that this could be written fluid ounces this could be FL oszi but because we are asked in milliliters we don't even need that FL it's just a Z for ounces so now on to the explanation I know regardless of which procedure I use or you which method I use dimensional analysis or proportion I know because of that formula sheet and that conversion sheet that one ounce is going to be equivalent to 30 MLS so even before I get into any of these methods here I just want to quickly kind of visualize this if I had a container in this container had and again what we're looking for is four ounces so if I could split this container its volume so I know it's volume but if I could split this container here here's one two three four each one of these represents one fluid ounce so I have a total of four fluid ounces every one of these is worth thirty milliliters so here's thirty here's 30 here's 30 and here's thirty I know if I were to add all these up I would get 120 therefore immediately I know that four ounces is equivalent to 120 milliliters I know that's very quick we didn't do any sort of multiplying or use a proportion but it's just visualizing what we know about this each ounce contains or is equivalent to 30 milliliters now what I'm going to do is I'm going to erase this and I'm going to solve this problem using dimensional analysis dimensional analysis uses conversion factors so I guess I'm going to just delete this part here we still need this one ounce equivalent to 30 MLS we still need that remember with dimensional analysis you always start with what you know what you are given we are given four ounces to convert so I'm going to start with my four ounces over one we're not working with a rate so we don't have any units here in the denominator with dimensional analysis we are using these conversion factors we're going to be multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a conversion factor if I wanted to cancel out bounces I need to be dividing by ounces and if I want to go from and cancel out ances and I want to go into milliliters then milliliters needs to go in the numerator I recommend that students first write in the unit's that they are cancelling out and then the unit's they are going into some students will rush into this and write the numbers and the unit's all in one here but first just realize I want to cancel out ances and I want to go into milliliters once I have these units listed I can now write them in I know one ounce is equivalent to 30 MLS since we are using dimensional analysis I am multiplying by 30 over 1 therefore I will multiply the numerators 4 times 30 this is a hundred and 20 the unit left in the numerator is MLS and the denominator I'll have 1 times 1 and there is no unit left so I have one and no unit this is equivalent to we're taking 120 and dividing it by 1 120 MLS so just to recap we started with what we are converting for ounces we realized that that's going to be written over one dimensional analysis uses multiplication factors here to cancel out units so we're cancelling out the ounces going into MLS I realize that that's all I need is just a one step problem multiply the numerators multiply the denominators the last thing that we're going to do is solve this problem using a proportion if you want to go back and look at the dimensional analysis again you're welcome to click on dimensional analysis at any time solving this problem with a proportion you still need this one ounce equivalent to 30 MLS this is a conversion factor regardless of what method we use it's necessary what this tells us if we want to use a proportion is that regardless of however many ounces we have if we were to reduce any sort of ratio it needs to reduce so that it's equivalent to one ounce over 30 ml s so this conversion factor can be written as a ratio of one ounce over 30 MLS now it doesn't matter however ounces how many ounces we start with or however many milliliters we start with when you divide another two another set of numbers over here this needs to be equivalent to 1 over 30 now we know the ounces is going to have to be in the numerator and we know the milliliters are going to have to be in the denominator that's because that's how proportions that's how we solve proportions we need the units to line up so we're going to have the units in the numerator or some of the units of ounces in the numerator and milliliters in the denominator so oh I know whatever numbers I put over here I can't actually choose I can't just put three and twelve or 17 and 20 I know I'm looking for one of these things I'm looking for a certain amount of milliliters don't know this and I want to know how many milliliters is contained in four ounces because we know we are dealing with equal ratios here I know whatever number that goes under MLS this ratio needs to be equivalent to 1 over 31 ounce over 30 MLS that's what a proportion tells us to solve a proportion I'm going to replace this question mark with an X to solve a proportion we cross multiply we do not multiply the numerators we do not multiply the denominators similar that we with this confusion that is usually set in from dimensional analysis we are multiplying one ounce times X so 1 times X 30 times 4 we get X equal to 120 if you leave your answer as X equal to 120 technically that's not correct keep in mind we want to go back up here our answer would be 120 MLS just to recap a proportion what we do with the proportion is we use the conversion factor we set that up as a ratio we are going to have an equivalent ratio where we know either the number of ounces are the number of MLS in this case we knew the number of ounces so we wrote 4 ounces because we were four up top because that's where the unit of ounces was I didn't know the number of ml so I put X there and I cross multiply to solve for x", "Lw0ObOdWnRE": "if you want results like this from a driveway paint job stay tuned mark here Rd manager with the Eastwood company the video you're about to see is how to paint your car in four easy steps we're gonna be using the Corvair door you see behind me but these techniques that you're gonna see will apply to the entire car also let's get started okay this particular door we have stripped down to bare metal I actually fabricated the door scandal on this one but what you want to do is either use abrasive blasting chemical strippers or actually paper and a DA to get down to the bare metal it's the best place to start now that we have it stripped down we're gonna use our free to remove any grease wax oils any contaminants on the surface you want to do this before you do any further sanding or filler because you don't want to bury those into the metal what you see here is we're taping off the vent window this was installed in the door just to make it a lot easier than trying to do this with fresh paint on it what we do want to do is protect the nice new seals that we bought so we're gonna mask those carefully at the door edge as you can see we're using a stir stick here to make sure that the tape gets between the actual seal and the metal of the door itself so we don't have a line later now we're gonna go ahead and mask off with paper tip here is don't use Christmas wrapping paper or newspaper the solids gonna bleed right through that use masking paper design for automotive paints what I'm doing now is applying guide coat this is used to identify any of your highs and lows on the panel its stealth stuff that your eye may miss I'm applying the guide coat and an even film across the entire panel now I'm gonna block that with the 80 grit and the long block a tip here is to use the longest board that you can that'll fit the panel I'm gonna block this in a crosshatch pattern what this does is this assures that you're maintaining a level surface and we're gonna use this same technique through the entire process here even all the way up to our color sanding as you can see from the horizontal lines we've identified the lows from when we use the English wheel to make this panel what we're gonna do now is skim coat the entire door knowing that we're gonna remove about 80% of the product but what this does is assures us that we have even coverage now I'm going to wipe the panel again with pre I want to make sure that we remove any type of grease contaminants as I said earlier you don't want to bury these into the base metal and then have them come back at you later now I'm mixing up our filler mix as per the instructions but two tips here need the hardener these things settle out and end up dumping a lot of liquid onto your fresh filler and second don't mix on cardboard the hardener itself will actually be absorbed into the fibers they're Mixel and dedicated paper or plastic mixing board now I applied the skim coat the entire panel as you see and then we're gonna give it it's about 15 minutes here to harden now I'm hitting it with the 80 grit in the long board we're using the 18 inch board again in the 80 grit paper and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sand from the style line to an edge I'm not gonna just sand couple inches in the center and just randomly move about the panel you have to think about as one fluid motion you want to be standing complete edge to edge line to line or body seam wherever you have a cut off again in the crosshatch pattern this will assure us our dead level flat surface so we just finished the first round of block sanding and it's coming out pretty good I want to hit it one more time to better identify any of the highs and the lows I'm applying our guide code again this time we're using it not only to identify the low spots but also to make sure that we're removing each of our previous grit sanding marks which you'll see in a minute here I'm sanding the panel again in our crosshatch pattern using the 18 inch block and the 80 grand what you want to do is progressively move up through your grits starting with 80 to 120 180 220 all the way up to 320 don't skip a step you're gonna think you're saving time right now what's gonna happen is when you get into base coat you're gonna see those deep scratches you need to progressively move up through the grits using the guide coat to assure that you've removed the previous grit sanding scratches this will assure a dead level and flat surface now what we've done is we've identified a couple lows that are gonna need a quick little skim coat of filler so I'll mix that up and just hit those areas don't worry about the bear spots and the cut through that you see here we're gonna take care of all that with epoxy primer in the next step it's always a good idea to remove any dust and debris using the tack cloth before applying any coatings I'll go ahead apply the guide coat and continue with the 120 on up through the grits to 320 here you can really see the importance of guide coat in identifying remaining 80 grit sanding scratches I still have to remove along with any other imperfections you can even see the difference in identifying the 80 and 120 grit scratches using the guy coat with the final block sanding of the filler completed we're ready to prep the paddle for epoxy primary after I did the final wipe down with pre and a tack rag I began mixing the epoxy paint or epoxy paint is a 1 to 1 ratio easy to mix and very easy to apply even for a beginner and remember you're gonna be blocking most of this down anyhow so you don't have to worry about a little nip here or a run now that we have the epoxy mixed up we're gonna go ahead and filter that into the gun with the lid one you're gonna have a vent on the top of your gravity feed guns here take that remove it and you'll see a small opening in there point that orifice towards you you don't want to take the chance of having any paint drip out of the vent won't to the surface itself before you spray the panel go ahead and test your fan pattern on a piece of masking paper I've adjusted the gun to about a 10 inch fan pattern here here's a tip moving forward what you want to do is spray all your jams and edges first then your main section if you do it opposite this you'll end up with overspray on the door skin I'm using a large fan pattern here for for a couple different reasons as you see we're spraying outside just as you're gonna be doing on your driveway what you want to do is you want to get the product on and get out we're using the epoxy primer here because there's excellent heejun to both the bare metal and the body filler I'm coming across the panel with a tack coat and then ninety degrees from that with a full wet coat to assure proper coverage [Music] going ahead and applying to full wet coats first hitting the edges and jams and then the main door skin as you can see we're spraying outside not everybody has a booth or access to a booth but don't worry don't be afraid with the right products and the right tools you're gonna end up with great results and don't be worried if you have a little bit of trash or a bug lands in we'll show you how to take care of that well there you go we had a bird land on the door anyhow you walked around a little area but good thing you had little feet and those things will level out we'll be able to fill it with the surfacer now we're back to the 18-inch board and we're using 320 we're gonna go ahead and block out this entire surface again using our crosshatch and going from bodyline to edge of panel remember you want to use the largest board that will fit your panel to assure an even and level surface the tip here is to use an abrasive pad instead of your paper around these irregular surfaces it tends to conform to them more easily okay here we are with our final wipe and tack a tip here again always wear rubber gloves you're gonna have on your hands you don't want to get that into your primer another tip here when using your lint-free cloth is always flip to a clean surface what you don't want to do is just move contaminants from one edge of the paddle to the other then go ahead and do your final tack in preparation for our urethane surface now we're gonna go ahead and apply the urethane primer surfacer mix per the instructions strain and fill the gun here's a little tip when spraying outside do your final tack rag just seconds before you're about to apply the paint this assures you have the cleanest surface possible I'm holding the gun about 10 inches from the surface and using a 50% overlap an important tip here is to maintain a consistent gun to paddle distance to avoid any heavy spots or light spray once the urethane surface is completely cured we're gonna go ahead and begin our block sanding process again apply the guide coat and here we're starting with a 320 grit on our 18-inch board using the crosshatch pattern continue up to 600 grit now I'm switching over to wet sanding the reason for that is the water tends to keep the paper clean you get a little bit better cut and a much much finer cut so we'll continue with that up to the 600 grit again not skipping any grits in between here I'm using a lint-free rag to get the majority of the dust off the panel most important step here is using your compressed air and you want to blow out any of the holes crevices or seams where dust and water may be trapped you want to get them out now before the paint gun finds them so that's why we're using at least fifty to sixty psi so that we're above the pressure of what your guns gonna be using the Eastwood mixing cups the mixed our base coats the appropriate ratio went ahead strained and filled the cup here I'm doing my final tack rag seconds before applying paint again spray your jams and edges first then come across with a 50 percent overlap go ahead and spray two to three full wet coats you you'll notice I'm applying additional coats ninety-degree to the first coat what this does this helps me achieve a more level surface and eliminate any Tiger striping especially when spraying metallics I'm spraying our eastwood ProStreet red here using the same 50% overlap and consistent gun to panel distance as you can see I'm using the same gun for our epoxy primer our urethane base coat and also for the clear the only thing we're doing is changing out the needle nozzle size after our base coat has completely cured we're gonna begin the wet sanding process as you can see we're standing a kiddie pool but trust me this will save you a lot of time and headache and cleanup especially on a driveway or garage floor so we're starting with 600 wet go ahead and continue in that crosshatch pattern that we've been using at this point I've switched at a 6-inch block while we're wet sanding we're no longer shaping the paddle so it's okay to use the smaller block which is more controllable I'm simply cutting off the tops of the nibs hitting any dirt or debris that may have landed in the coating here's a tip if you find during the color sanding process that you cut through your color back into your primer simply take a paper matchstick or a corner of a paper towel and touch it up with some base coat with our urethane clear accurately mixed strained and poured into the cup it's time to spray seconds before spraying do your final tack rag go ahead and apply two to three full wet coats just as you did base with your edges first then your main panel we're spraying our two-to-one european clear which is a very user friendly clear we have three different temperature activators simply match them up to the temperature of the day you'll be spraying and you'll achieve excellent results with beautiful flow out we're spraying to clear 45 minutes after the base coat had cured and we finished our block sanding if you had to stop at this point for a day or two you're gonna need to sand the surface and go ahead through your pre cleaning prep just as we did prior to spraying base coat after 48 hours of allowing our clear to cure it was time to wet sand it so back into the pool started with a thousand grit again our crosshatch pattern and then moved up to 1,500 and 2,000 I'm using my wiper in-between grits here to not only clean the surface but I'm also checking to look for color when you're sanding clear it's gonna be a milky clear color if you find red on your wiper that means you cut through your clear which is no big deal finish out your block sanding and apply two more coats of clear [Music] once we're done with the wet sanding process it's time to move on to the buffing so go ahead and use a high-quality system to achieve that showroom shine I chose the Norton system which is a three pad system for three easy steps just remember to saturate the pads and use minimal pressure on the panel I'm starting with the wool pad which will remove our 2,000 grit sanding scratches I'll then follow that up with the two foam pads to achieve professional results as you progress through each of the pads you'll notice the depth of image and the clarity will become more pronounced now switch to the blue pad which will remove any of the swirl marks from our wool pad and you can clearly see the depth of image becoming more brilliant lastly I'll finish with the white pad which will give you that brilliant finish you've been after [Music] you can see the results we achieved the reflection the clarity and all this done outside you can see the Eastwood logo clearly in the paint can and even read the serial number of this hundred dollar bill as you can see we finished the door and we're more than happy with the results you can see by the dollar bill in there and reflection in the gallon can the depth of image is pretty spectacular especially for painting this outside so I hope this gives you the confidence to tackle a paint job at home even if you're outside you can see the results that we achieved it's no different doing this door then it would be a complete car it's just panel at a time that's the way you think about it so for detailed instruction list and all the tools required to complete this job at home go ahead and visit eastwood.com", "_IR3p0CxlLg": "yes this yes there's a whole lot of spite that gets added to this cake i don't think i would call it a revenge recipe hey everyone i'm claire welcome to my home kitchen today i'm showing you a recipe that's very near and dear to my heart it is st louis cooley butter cake this is a specialty of my hometown st louis and it is a coffee cake with this vanilla e sweet gooey topping and a yeasted base it's super super delicious and just something that i grew up eating and is one of my favorites and i'm excited to show you and introduce it to you at home so i'm from st louis and that's a town that has a number of quirky food traditions that are hyper specific to st louis so things like toasted ravioli which are breaded fried ravioli that you dip in marinara sauce st louis style pizza with provel cheese but my favorite as a lover of dessert is gooey butter cake and i'm going to show you how to make my version which is a little less sweet but so so good and very true to the original when i was a kid well when i was a teenager so my friends and i we weren't the coolest we didn't have the most plans on the weekends so we would entertain ourselves by having baking competitions and we would pick a theme and i'll bake something and bring it to someone's house and then we would like appoint a judge and like we at that point it wasn't like really a thing but we would sort of like declare a winner and then hang out and watch a movie so one time it was cakes and i remember i remember this so well i made my mom take me to the grocery store and she probably spent like 50 bucks on ingredients and i made this like very elaborate chocolate layer cake and then my friend joe her entry into the baking competition was a gooey butter cake that she made from a mix which no shame but i remember she said that she messed up the mix the first time and her mom had to go out and buy her another mix so that she could make it and then she won she was the declared the winner and i remember being like i can't believe i lost this competition to someone who a made it from a mix and b messed up the first version and had to do it again so i have to confront joe about this and i want her to try this version so we are going to make that happen hopefully um we're still friends uh i have not forgotten in terms of special equipment i use a stand mixer you could do it by hand you'll just have to like mix a little longer and then you'll need a 9x13 pan typically i discourage people from baking in glass but this is one recipe where if you have a glass baking dish it's actually useful for a couple different reasons and then that's pretty much it ingredients it looks like a lot of ingredients but really it's the same ingredient in two different places because we have a recipe for the yeasted coffee cake base and then the topping so it's really straightforward stuff unsalted butter sugar milk all-purpose flour egg brown sugar a little bit of heavy cream for the topping vanilla salt and an important ingredient in the topping is corn syrup which helps to keep it really gooey that's really it [Music] i'm going to show you how to put together the yeasted cake base like i say every single time the first thing we do is proof the yeast so it's just a teaspoon i'm going to use a quarter cup of warm water the book often i say the instructions i give are like warm whatever liquid you're using to proof in a saucepan but i have pretty hot tap water and you don't even want something that hot so i just i just run the water until i feel it warm to the touch and then i have to walk over here and not spill it okay a quarter cup of water goes in and then i whisk to dissolve everything because i'm not adding sugar to this mixture the yeast are it's not going to bubble up really actively you only get lots of foaming when you have the presence of sugar which is food for the yeast so i'm not looking for like i'm not gonna see bubbling so i'm not gonna that's not the indicator here i'm really just looking for this to smell very yeasty and be kind of like cloudy and a little bit puffed but not gonna get a lot of activity here so i'm gonna put that right there to this i'm adding my milk my eggs sugar diamond kosher salt one teaspoon if you're using morton give it a half teaspoon then i'm gonna add two cups of flour so i'm gonna have a half cup that i'm gonna hold back and i'll show you why and i'm gonna mix this together and then with the mixer running i'm going to add my butter this is a very calorie dense cake but it's also because of that it's very rich and so you know it's best when cut into really small pieces but i think it's worth it all right so here's what we have this is still kind of batter like it's still basically liquid you know it's pourable and now we're going to add the rest of the flour and use the dough hook and create something that's not quite a dope but not quite a batter with something that's yeasted like you always have to develop a certain amount of gluten for the thing to actually rise so that's why i'm using the dough hook and i just want to develop this batter dough hybrid a little bit so with this running i'm going to add the remaining flour a tablespoon at a time because flour amounts are often inexact and really what you're going for is the proper texture i gotta wash my hands i just pet the cat this is right where i want it to be the dough batter is gathered around the hook and pulling away from the sides a little bit so i like this texture i'm gonna stop it if for whatever reason you're at this point and you still have something that feels really liquid you can add a little more flour and now this is going to rise so i like to cover it sometimes i use these silicone bowl covers so i don't have to use plastic so depending on the temperature of your kitchen this could take an hour to two hours to rise i'm going gonna put in a warm spot to encourage that to rise don't put it in like a very warm spot don't put it on your radiator or anything because the butter in the dough batter could kind of melt and then get a little greasy so put it in a slightly warm spot to rise while that dough is rising you can prepare your pan so i know i talked about putting it in a glass pan i have my glass 13x9 pan in my fridge with the batter already set up so i'm using the only other 13 by nine i have which is metal the reason i generally don't like to baking glass is because glass takes a long time to heat up it's not an effective heat conductor compared to metal the glass gets very very hot and retains the heat so when you pull something out of the oven it continues to bake and what often happens is something that you thought was done is actually overcooked because it continued to cook in the glass and you get like overdone edges there's some baked goods where actually having more browning and doneness around the edges is a good thing and gooey butter cake is one of them so this is one recipe where it is effective to baking glass and also it helps you better gauge the rising of the dough i have some room temperature butter here and i'm coating the pan a very very generous layer on the bottom and sides this is the glue butter dough batter that i made last night and i let it rise in the fridge overnight so it has nearly doubled in size you can see when i press it i know that it's risen and there's air in it because i press my finger and it springs back and only leaves a slight indentation so that's how i know that this is risen plus it's just you know i can tell by the volume difference so i'm going to press this batter into this pan so just stretch this all the way to the edges and across the bottom this was really easy to press into this because it was cold but at the same time if you're using room temp batter it should also be very extensible and it might just be sticky but you shouldn't have a hard time getting it into an even layer it'll look really thin but actually this cake bakes up really tall in the oven so don't you didn't do anything wrong it's normal for this to seem a little bit meager across the bottom this is the point at which if you're making this recipe and you're going to bake it the next day this goes into the fridge and rests overnight and we finish the first rise this is where it's going to go through its second rise then all you do in the morning is create the topping put it over the cake and bake it so i have one that i set up last night i already went through its first rise and has now risen in the pan and that's in glass i'm going to show you another reason why glass is really useful for this recipe so go ahead and cover this here is the one from yesterday now when i pressed the dough into the pan i put a piece of tape on the side and i marked the level of the dough inside the pan so this is just a very useful way of being able to gauge how this dough is rising we want to let this get a little bit taller but while we're letting this rise we can make the topping [Music] the first thing i want to do is mix together my liquid ingredients the topping it's hard to describe what this mixture is it is basically an extremely buttery loose batter of sorts and also with the addition of corn syrup and corn syrup the function of corn syrup in this recipe is to basically create a kind of soft chewiness that doesn't harden when it cools um and is like very key to the texture of the topping so i have a quarter cup of heavy cream a full tablespoon of vanilla and please just use the real stuff or make your own foreshadowing i hate measuring out corn syrup it's not that big of a deal if you do a little more or less so i'm gonna call that two tablespoons ten tablespoons of unsalted butter then one cup of granulated sugar and a little bit of brown sugar okay so i'm gonna mix this together and let it get light and fluffy i'm gonna add my salt now i need one teaspoon yeah i mean oh yeah just put it up on the screen you know so we're following basic like cake making procedure creaming the ingredients adding the egg and then we add the wet and dry ingredients usually for the most evenly mixed batter we alternate wet and dry starting and ending with dry so i'm just adding half the flour then i'll slowly add this corn syrup vanilla cream mixture and then the remaining flour then often just to ensure thorough mixing i'll like give it a couple of those now i'm gonna fill my pastry bag again having it stand up in any kind of container like this makes it very very easy maybe maya will get on the instagram account round animals truly one of my favorites she's quite rotund okay lift up the sides and try to avoid dragging any of the batter onto that the upper part of the bag then lift it out we have our filled bag and then this container is clean this is where a scraper comes in handy one of the many uses for a bench or bowl scraper you can use this to further eliminate air bubbles and air pockets by just forcing the mixture down into the bag this might be one where i'm using every single piece of essential equipment because i'm about to use yeah yeah some powdered sugar i'm snipping maybe like a one and a half inch opening and by the way save this plastic it's perfectly good you can see that there's like there's big air bubbles when i do the poke test it springs back this this cake is risen so to that end i'm going to preheat my oven because this is basically ready to go so you want a rack in the center preheat to 350. gather the ends of the bag and then twist and that will force the mixture in the bag to the very end and you can start piping so as you go keep twisting i still have more i'm going to go like here okay that was everything from the bag and now with count spatula i'm going to smooth this into a single layer and this is very important you want to make sure that along the edges of your 13x9 pan that you are anchoring the topping to the side of the pan and the reason you want it to touch is because something magical happens when the cake bakes and the topping that touches the sides gets really brown and crunchy that is like the best part of the cake so i'm pulling off the tape don't forget to pull off the tape before you bake so you don't really want to bake a piece of tape although i've done it before nothing happens my oven's on 350. i'm going to put this guy in and then i'll go 30 to 40 minutes so my idea is to make obviously my homemade version and then make the boxed version and then i want to give joe a chance to blind taste test both and i want to hear her reactions i want her to tell me what is like closer to her memory of st louis glee better cake and which he prefers i'm pretty sure she's gonna be able to tell the difference it's probably gonna be like night and day but i don't know we'll see what she says about it i'm at the low end of the time range for the cake so it's been about 30 minutes and i didn't look but i could smell it so then i just peeked and it looks done so i'm going to pull it out and show it to you oh you guys it's so magical so you can see the cake rose quite a bit i like the glass because i can see that there's nice golden brown color around the edges this is the perfect doneness it's still pale and even a little bit shiny in the center and when i pulled it out of the oven there was a very very slight wobble so i haven't overcooked the center but i have beautiful browning around the edges so this is where i said be really certain that you are anchoring the topping to the sides of the pan because i have this this is the best part of the cake this caramelized crunchy edge and then now the cake is cooling you can see that it's starting to fall and create these like ravine ravines of gooeyness in the cake so i love the doneness the cake looks nicely baked along the sides and bottom i think it's going to be perfect i just have to let it cool the cake has had a chance to cool and it's further settled so you can really see the ravines of gooey topping this little part here is kind of like a topographical map this is classic gooey butter cake it's this crazy surface so now i'm gonna put the finishing touches on the gray butter cake so i can eat it and i'm using my very convenient dusting wand so now it's a topographical nap with snow on it with the right amount of baking i think this probably could have gone like two minutes less time actually um and there still would have been browning but the cake will pull away from the sides so like this edge in particular it contracted a bit so that's normal you'll you'll notice that and i'm going to cut out a slice this is what we're looking for see that that gooeyness and here too oh that looks really good i think it actually overproofed and what happened is the cake got so light that it kind of switched places but the topping in the oven which you'll see sometimes so like really the gooey layer supposed to sit on top here it sunk a little bit to the bottom so that just happens with the natural kind of um like irregularity of the baking every version is a little different but it certainly doesn't affect the flavor and you can see that the cake itself is not at all dry it's tender but it still has a kind of pleasing like bready texture something truly magical happens between the butter and the vanilla and the cream and the brown sugar it is i don't know how to describe it like the flavor of this cake is gooey butter flavor you kind of just have to make it and try it for yourself and see why this is like every st louisen's favorite recipe it's just so good this is one of my favorite recipes in dessert person a favorite among favorites really and um something that i grew up eating i hope it becomes a favorite in your family too thank you for watching like subscribe ring the bell what's the thing that's the thing all right i'll be back here later making more stuff put this down eat that later have you had breakfast yet no how do you feel about sweet breakfast i love it yeah i had uh i was doing that thing where you know you do chocolate croissant to start the week oh that thing yeah and then and then this week i didn't do it because i didn't have time so you start your week off with the chocolate croissant yeah but usually i like to pick it apart you know like like a bird but this one is so good that you can't pick it yeah so you didn't do that this week no so we're going to make up for it okay i want to first talk to you about remember in high school when we did the bacon competition yes describe the one where you won i won fair and square so this is a cool thing that lots of teams do is baking competitions when other people are actually literally going to parties and smoking pot some people do baking competitions right but everybody did their own thing i think you did a dark chocolate raspberry layer cake okay overkill and then and then uh lily did a low-fat blueberry layered cake i think i have poppy seeds yeah yeah yeah or maybe lemon it was lemon okay and what did you make and i made a st louis tradition i thought why not get back to my roots and i made a gooey butter cake that pleased the crowd and how did you make it huh just kind of um you know whipped it up didn't it came from a box right it well the recipe called for a box cake mix right and that's the authentic recipe and you're going to argue with it that's like how do you make pancakes with a mix no no so okay so it was it was a cake it was a box cake mix it wasn't like a gooey butter no no it was no no it was a yeah it was a black cake mix so you followed a recipe that used the box cake mix yeah pretty creative actually yeah okay and now if i recall correctly you messed up the first i think i think yeah my mom had to make me help me make a new one she made the second one because i i didn't really do it okay all right it comes out um okay but now i want you to try two versions of saint louis butter cake tell me what you think okay i made both versions already i can tell you the color is accurate okay now i appreciate you giving me corner pieces yes yes yes i mean this is the this is the color you're looking for how would you describe the color i'd say it's yellow and that's it that's that's and this crust this is what you're looking for too i don't really know how to describe food i'm finding i feel like it's like shiny and crackly yeah and got a film uh-huh yes like a hard film that's obviously what you look good for okay so i should take i take a bite okay um [Music] [Laughter] this is it this is the winning one no you didn't even it came from st louis there's no question to me this is it tastes like it's got the good cake mix in it yeah the zip okay so do you feel like you even want to taste the other one i mean i will but this is it for sure oh no this really didn't go the way i was hoping okay so this doesn't look like this is not gooey butter cake this is not what we're looking at here this looks i mean this looks like some kind of german delicacy i'll tell you that you got two layers this one you got three layers cake blue film this is just cake and honestly not even goo almost more like um what would you call it soft cake so i mean i'll eat this but i can tell you i mean it looks good uh-huh that's a good bite right there mhm it's good cake but would i call it gooey butter cake oh listen here's what i'm looking for yellow dye okay here's the problem with st louis foods they taste like [ __ ] but you've been so accustomed to the [ __ ] that your your brain is tripped forever i my favorite pizza is pizza which is the most you know inedible food in the world yeah i always tell that to people like i can't recommend it to you like don't try it it's also good i love it another film based food film filmy cheese um of a sweet tomato paste and then a cracker crust and that's what i thought pizza so when i you know when i think gooey butter cake this obviously is a better cake we know that okay all right we know that that was kind of all i wanted to hear you say yeah i understand it i suppose it was easier than i even imagined for you to tell the difference between the two mm-hmm this is like you give me nachos and you pour you know hockey cheese on it and then you know the cheese from the hockey games like the liquid yes okay and i'm like oh these are really good nachos you know knowing that they're bad nachos how much of this food are you eating i don't i eat a lot of crap yeah i've been getting into protein powders what are you putting it in well apparently you can make cakes out of protein powders oh yeah yeah if you microwave them so think about it next time make it something oh maybe in the next book this is obviously a good cake okay thank you thank you that's all i wanted to hear you're just you know it's like you're making you know ring pops with metal right like a real diamond yeah so i just want to say that 20 years later yeah oh i'm not at least no numbers no numbers i'm not still upset about the bake off where you won with a box mix and make gooey butter cake because glee butter cake really is delicious and i still even kind of like that version so yes you do yes you do these are this is our hometown favorite and even though we live in the big city now it's still delicious indeed right indeed well you can take that home with you thank you so much i can't believe it i mean these are really good i know right here put that one in that one and then take it home that way okay and then see what mike thinks okay i'm gonna tell you mike has trash taste just like me so that's kind of how we get along [Music] my kitties [Music]", "f-wWBGo6a2w": "[CLASSICAL MUSIC] [APPLAUSE AND CHEERS] Well, thank you all very much for coming to this. It's really shocking to me that you don't have anything better to do on a Tuesday night. [AUDIENCE LAUGHTER] No, but seriously, though, it is. I mean, it's very strange in some sense that there's so many of you here to listen to a sequence of lectures on the psychological significance of the Biblical stories. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, but it still does surprise me that there's a ready audience for it. So that's good, so we'll see how it goes. I'll start with this because this is the right question. The right question is why bother doing this. And I don't mean why should I bother doing it. I have my own reasons for doing it, but you might think, well, why bother with this strange, old book at all? And... That's a good question. You know, Umm It's a contradictory... document that's been cobbled together over thousands of years. It's outlasted kingdoms, many,  many kingdoms, you know? It's very interesting, it turns out that a book is more durable than stone. It's more durable than a castle. It's more durable than an empire. And that's really interesting. That something, in some sense, so evanescent, can be so long living. So there's that, that's kind of a mystery. I'm approaching this whole scenario, this Biblical stories as if they're a mystery, fundamentally. Because they are, there's a lot we don't understand about them. We don't understand how they came about. We don't really understand how they were put together. We don't understand why they had such an unbelievable impact on civilization. We don't understand how people could have believed them. We don't understand what it means that we don't believe them now, or even what it would mean if we did believe them. And then, on top of all that, there's the additional problem, which isn't specific to me, but is certainly relevant to me, that no matter how educated you are, you're not educated enough to discuss the psychological significance of the Biblical stories. But I'm going to do my best. Partly because I want to learn more about them, and one of the things I've learned is that the best way to learn about something is to talk about it. And when I'm lecturing, I'm thinking, you know, I'm not trying to tell you what I know for sure to be the case. Because there's lots of things I don't know for sure to be the case. I'm trying to make sense out of this. And I have been doing this for a long time. Now, you may know, you may not, that I'm an admirer of Nietzsche. Nietzsche was a devastating critic of, I would say, dogmatic Christianity. Christianity as it was instantiated in institutions. I suppose... although he's a very paradoxical thinker. For example, one of the things Nietzsche said was that he didn't believe that the scientific revolution would have ever got off the ground if it hadn't been for Christianity. And more specifically, for Catholicism because he believed that over the course of, really, a thousand years, the European mind, so to speak, had to train itself to interpret everything that was known within a single, coherent framework. Coherent if you accept the initial axioms. A single coherent framework. So Nietzsche believed that that Catholicization of the phenomena of life and of history produced the kind of mind that was then capable of transcending its dogmatic foundations and then concentrating on something else. Which, in this particular case, happened to be the natural world. And so Nietzsche believed that, in some sense, that Christianity died at its own hand that spent a very long period of time trying to attune people to the necessity of the truth. Absent corruption and all of that, that's always part of any human endeavor. And then the truth, the spirit of the truth that was developed by Christianity turned on the roots of Christianity. And everyone woke up and said or thought something like, \"Well how is it that we came to believe any of this?\" It's like waking up one day and noting that you really don't know why you put the Christmas tree up. You'd been doing it for a long time, and that's what people do, you know, and there are reasons that Christmas trees came about. But the ritual lasts long after the reasons have been forgotten. So, now Nietzsche, although he was a critic of Christianity, and also a champion of its disciplinary capacity, because you see, the other thing that Nietzsche believed was it's not possible to be free, in some sense, unless you have been a slave. By that he meant that you don't go from childhood to full-fledged adult individuality. You go from childhood to a state of discipline, which you might think is akin to slavery, to self-imposed slavery, that would be the best scenario, where you have to discipline yourself to become something specific, before you might be able to re-attain the generality that you had as a child. And he believed that Christianity had played that role for Western civilization. But, in the late 1800s, he announced that God was dead. And you often hear of that as something triumphant. But for Nietzsche, it wasn't because he was too nuanced a thinker to be that simple-minded. See, Nietzsche understood that, this is something I'm going to try to make clear, is that there's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience, that we don't know about reality. And we have our articulated representations of the world, and then you can think of outside of that: there are things we know absolutely nothing about. And there's a buffer between them. And those are things we sort of know something about. We don't know them in an articulated way, here's an example. You know sometimes you're arguing with someone close to you and they're in a bad mood, you know? And they're being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up. And maybe all of the sudden they get angry, or maybe they cry. And then when they cry, they figure out what they're angry about and it has nothing to do with you, even though you might have been what precipitated the argument. And that's an interesting phenomena as far as I'm concerned, because it means that people can know things at one level without being able to speak what they know at another. So in some sense, the thoughts rise up from the body, and they do that in moods, and they do that in images, and they do that in actions. And we have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner. So we have this articulated space that we can all discuss and then outside of that we have something that is more akin to a dream that we're embedded in. It's an emotional dream that we're embedded in. That's based, at least in part, on our actions, I'll describe that later. And then outside of that is what we don't know anything about at all. And in that dream, that's where the mystics live, and that's where the artists live. And they're the mediators between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure. You see, what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of knowledge that we don't really understand. And that if those two things are out of sync, so you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream, then we become dissociated internally. We think things we don't act out and we act out things we don't dream. And that produces a kind of sickness of the spirit. And that sickness of the spirit, its cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation. And then people turn to things like ideologies, which I regard as parasites on an underlying religious substructure to try to organize their thinking, and then that's a catastrophe. And that's what Nietzsche foresaw. You see, he knew that when we knocked the slats out of the base of Western civilization by destroying this representation, this \"god ideal,\" let's say, that we would destabilize and move back and forth violently between nihilism and the extremes of ideology. He was particularly concerned about radical left ideology. He believed and predicted this in the late eighteen hundreds, which is really an absolute intellectual tour-de-force of staggering magnitude. He predicted that in the twentieth century that hundreds of millions of people would die because of the replacement of these underlying dreamlike structures with this rational but deeply incorrect representation of the world. And we've been oscillating back and forth between left and right, in some sense, ever since, with some good sprinkling of nihilism in there, and despair. In some sense, that's the situation of the modern Western person and increasingly, of people in general. You know, I think part of the reason that Islam has its back up, with regards to the West to such a degree, I mean there's many reasons, and not all of them are valid, that's for sure, but one of the reasons is that they, being still grounded in a dream, let's say, they can see that the rootless questioning mind of the West poses a tremendous danger to the integrity of their culture. And it does, I mean, Westerners, us, we undermine ourselves all the time with our searching intellect. And I'm not complaining about that. There isn't anything easy that can be done about it. But it's still a sort of fruitful catastrophe. And it has real effects on people's lives. It's not some abstract thing. Lots of times, when I've been treating people with depression, for example, or anxiety, they have existential issues, you know? It's not just some psychiatric condition. It's not just that they're tapped off of normal because their brain chemistry is faulty, although sometimes that happens to be the case. It's that they are overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their life and they're not sure why it's reasonable to continue with it. They can feel the terrible negative meanings of life, but are skeptical beyond belief about any of the positive meanings. I had one client who's a very brilliant artist and as long as he didn't think he was fine. Because he'd go and create, and he was really good at being an artist. He had that personality that was continually creative and quite brilliant, although he was self-denigrating. But as soon as he started to think about what he was doing, then, it's like a drill or a saw, he'd saw the branch off that he was sitting on. He'd start to criticize what he was doing, even the utility of it, even though it was sort of self-evidently useful. And then it would be very, very hard for him to even motivate himself to create. He alway struck me as a good example of the consequences of having your rational intellect divorced in some way from your being. Divorced enough that it actually questions the utility of your being. And it's not a good thing, it's not a good thing. It's really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only in individual psychopathology, but also in social psychopathology, and that's this proclivity of people to get tangled up in ideologies, which I really do think of, they're like crippled religions, that's the right way to think about them. They're like religion that's missing an arm and a leg but can still hobble along. And it provides a certain amount of security and group identity, but it's warped and twisted and demented and bent. And it's a parasite on something underlying that's rich and true. That's how it looks to me, anyways. So I think it's very important that we sort out this problem. I think that there isn't anything more important that needs to be done that. I've thought that for a long, long time. Probably since the early eighties, when I started looking at the role that belief systems played in regulating psychological and social health. You can tell that they do that because of how upset people get if you challenge their belief systems. It's like, why the hell do they care, exactly? What difference does it make if all of your ideological axioms are 100% correct? People get unbelievably upset when you poke them in the axioms, so to speak. [LAUGHTER] And it is not by any stretch of the imagination obvious why. But there's some, it's like there's a fundamental truth that they're standing on. It's like they're on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you're starting to pull out the logs. They're afraid they're going to fall in and drown. It's like, drown in what? What are the logs protecting them from? Why are they so afraid to move beyond the confines of the ideological system? These are not obvious things. So, I've been trying to puzzle that out for a very long time. I've done some lectures about that are on Youtube; most of you know that. Some of what I'm going to talk about in this series you'll have heard, if you've listened to the Youtube videos. You know, I'm trying to hit it from different angles. So Nietzsche's idea was that human beings were going to have to create their own values, essentially. Now he understood that we understood that we have bodies and we have motivations and emotions. Like, he was a romantic thinker, in some sense, but way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn't some free-floating soul but was embedded in our physiology, constrained by our emotions, shaped by our motivations, shaped by our body. He understood that. But he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would be for human beings themselves to become something akin to God and to create their own values. And he thought about the person who creates their own values as the over-man or the super-man. And that was one of the parts of Nietzschian philosophy that the Nazis, I would say, took out of context and used to fuel their superior man ideology. And we know what happened with that. That didn't seem to turn out very well, that's for sure. I also spent a lot of time reading Carl Jung. It was through Jung and also Jean Piaget, who was a developmental psychologist, that I started to understand that our articulated systems of thought are embedded in something like a dream and that that dream was informed, in a complex way, by the way we act. We act out things we don't understand all the time. If that wasn't the case, then we wouldn't need a psychology or a sociology or an anthropology or any of that because we would be completely transparent to ourselves. And we're clearly not. So, we're much more complicated than we understand, which means that the way that we behave contains way more information than we know. And part of the dream that surrounds our articulated knowledge is being extracted as a consequence of us watching each other behave and telling stories about it for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. Extracting out patterns of behavior that characterize humanity. And trying to represent them, partly through imitation, but also drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that. To represent what we're like so we can understand what we're like. That process of understanding is what I see unfolding, at least in part, in the Biblical stories. And it's halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and all of that, which is one of the things that makes the book so complex. But I see in it a struggle of humanity to rise above its animal forebears, say, and to become conscious of what it means to be human. And that's a very difficult thing because we don't know who we are or what we are or where we came from or any of those things. The light life is an unbroken chain going back three and a half billion years. It's an absolutely unbelievable thing. Every single one of your ancestors reproduced successfully for three and a half billion years. It's absolutely unbelievable. We rose out of the dirt and the muck and here we are, conscious, but not knowing. And we're trying to figure out who we are. A story, or several stories, that we've been telling for three thousand years seems to me to have something to offer. And so, when I look at the stories in the Bible, I do it, I would say, in some sense with the beginner's mind. It's a mystery, this book. How the hell it was made, why it was made, why we preserved it, how it happened to motivate an entire culture for two thousand years, and to transform the world. What's going on? How did that happen? It's by no means obvious, and one of the things that bothers me about casual critics of religion is that they don't take the phenomena seriously. And it's a serious phenomena. Not least because people have the capacity for religious experience, and no one know why that is. I mean, you can induce it reliably, in all sorts of different ways. You can do it with brain stimulation. You can certainly do it with drugs. There's, especially the psychedelic variety, they produce intimations of the divine extraordinarily regularly. People have been using drugs like that for God only knows how long, fifty thousand years, maybe more than that, to produce some sort of intimate union with the divine. We don't understand any of that when we discovered the psychedelics in the late sixties. It shocked everybody so badly that they were instantly made illegal and abandoned, in terms of research, for like fifty years. And it's no wonder, because who the hell expected that? Nobody. Now, now Jung was a student of Nietzsche's, you see, and he was also, I would say, a very astute critic of Nietzsche. He was educated by Freud, and Freud Freud, I suppose, in some sense, started to collate the information that we had pertaining to the notion that people lived inside a dream. You know, it was Freud who really popularized the idea of the unconscious mind. We take this for granted to such a degree today that we don't understand how revolutionary the idea was. But what's happened with Freud is that we've taken all the marrow out of his bones, so to speak, and left the husk behind. And now when we think about Freud, we just think about the husk because that's everything that's been discarded. But so much of what he discovered is part of our popular conception now, including the idea that your perceptions and your actions and your thoughts are all, what would you say, informed and shaped by unconscious motivations that are not part of your voluntary control. And that's a very, very strange thing. It's one of the most unsettling things about the psychoanalytic theories is the psychoanalytic theories are something like, you're a loose collection of living sub-personalities, each with its own set of motivations and perceptions and emotions and rationales, all of that. And you have limited control over that, so you're like a plurality of internal personalities that's loosely linked into a unity. And you know that because you can't control yourself very well, which is one of Jung's objections to Nietzsche's idea that we can create our own values is that is that Jung didn't believe that, especially not after interacting with Freud. Because he saw that human beings were affected by things that were- deeply, deeply affected by things that were beyond their conscious control. An no one really knows how to conceptualize those things. The cognitive psychologists think about them in some sense as computational machines. The ancient people, I think, thought of them as gods, although it's more complex than that. Like rage would be a god. Mars, the god of rage, that's the thing that possesses you when you're angry. It has a viewpoint, it says what it wants to say. And that might have very little to do with what you want to say when you're being sensible. And it doesn't just inhabit you, it inhabits everyone. And it lives forever, and it even inhabits animals. So it's this transcendent psychological entity that inhabits the body politic, like a thought inhabits the brain. That's one way of thinking about it. A very strange way of thinking, but it certainly has its merits. And so in some sense, those are deities, although it's not that simple. And so Jung got very interested in dreams and started to understand the relationship between dreams and myths. Because he would see in his clients' dreams echoes of stories that he knew because he was deeply read in mythology. And then he started to believe that the dream was the birthplace of the myth and that there was a continual interaction between the two processes, the dream and the story, and storytelling. Well, you know, you tend to tell your dreams as stories when you remember them. Some people remember dreams all the time, like two or three a night. I've had clients like that. They often have archetypal dreams that have very clear mythological structures. I think that's more the case with people who are creative, by the way, especially if they're a bit unstable, at the time. Because the dream tends to occupy the space of uncertainty and to concentrate on fleshing out the unknown reality before you get a real grip on it. So it's like the dream is the birthplace of thinking, that's a good way of thinking about it. So because it's the birthplace of thinking, it's not that clear. It's doing its best to formulate something. That was Jung's notion, as opposed to Freud, who believed that there were sensors, internal sensors that were hiding the dream's true message. That's not what Jung believed, he believed the dream was doing its best to express a reality that was still outside of fully articulated conscious comprehension. Because you think, look, a thought appears in your head, right? That's obvious. Bang, it's nothing you ever ask about. But what the hell does that mean? A thought appears in your head. What kind of ridiculous explanation is that? It just doesn't help with anything. Where does it come from? Well, nowhere. It just appears in my head. Okay, well, that's not a very sophisticated explanation, as it turns out. So you might think that those thoughts that you think, well, where do they come from? Well, they're often someone else's thoughts, right? Someone long dead, that might be part of it, just like the words you use to think are utterances of people who've been long dead. And so you're informed by the spirit of your ancestors, that's one way of looking at it. And your motivations speak to you, your emotions speak to you, your body speaks to you. And it does all that, at least in part, through the dream. And the dream is the birthplace of the fully articulated idea. They don't just come from nowhere fully fledged, right? They have a developmental origin, and God only knows how lengthy that origin is, even to say something like, \"I am conscious.\" Chimpanzees don't say that. It's been seven million years since we broke from chimpanzees, something like that, from the common ancestor. They have no articulated knowledge at all and very little self-representation in some sense, and very little self-consciousness. And that's not the case with us at all. We had to painstakingly figure all of this out during that, you know, seven million year voyage. And I think some of that's represented and captured, in some sense, in these ancient stories. Which I believe were part of, especially the oldest stories, in Genesis, which are the stories we're going to start with, they were... that... some of the archaic nature of the human being is encapsulated in those stories, and it's very, very instructive as far as I can tell. I'll give you just a quick example. You know there's an idea of sacrifice in the Old Testament. And it's pretty barbaric, you know, I mean the story of Abraham and Isaac, there's a good example of that because Abraham is called on to actually sacrifice his own son, which doesn't really seem like something that a reasonable God would ask you to do, right? God in the Old Testament is frequently cruel and arbitrary and demanding and paradoxical, which is one of the things that really gives the book life because it wasn't edited by a committee, you know, a committee that was concerned with not offending anyone, that's for sure. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] So Jung believed that the dream was the birthplace of thought and I've been extending that idea because one of the things I wondered about deeply was, you know, you have a dream and then someone interprets it. You can argue about whether or not an interpretation is valid, just like you can argue about whether your interpretation of a novel or movie is valid, right? It's a very difficult thing to determine with any degree of accuracy, which accounts in part for the post-modern critique. But my observations being that people will present a dream and sometimes we can extract out real useful information from it that the person didn't appear. And they get a flash of insight. To me that's a marker that we've stumbled on something that unites part of that person that wasn't united before. It pulls things together, which is often what a good story will do, whereas sometimes a good theory, you know if things snap together for you, there's a little light goes on, and that's one of the markers that I've used for accuracy in dreams. In my own family, when I was first married, you know, I'd have fights with my wife, arguments about this and that. I'm fairly hot-headed and so I'd get all puffed up and agitated about whatever we were arguing about, and she'd go to sleep, which was really annoying, it is so annoying! [LAUGHTER] Because I couldn't sleep, right? I was like, chewing off my fingernails, and she'd, like, sleeping peacefully beside me and it's so maddening. But often she'd have a dream, you know, and then the next morning, she'd discuss it with me, and then we could unravel what was at the bottom of our argument. That was unbelievably useful, even though it was extraordinarily aggravating. So you know, I was convinced by Jung. It looked to me like his ideas about the relationship between dreams and mythology and drama and literature made sense to me and the relationship between that and art. I know this native carver, he's a Kwakwaka'wakw guy. He's carved a bunch of wooden sculptures, totem poles and masks that I have at my house. He's a very interesting person. Not literate, not particularly literate, and really still steeped in this ancient, 13,000 year old tradition. He's an original language speaker and the fact that he isn't literate has sort of left him with the mind of someone who's pre-literate. Pre-literate people aren't stupid, they're just not literate, so their brains are organized differently in many ways. And I've asked him about his intuition for his carvings, and he's told me that he dreams, like, you've seen the Haida masks, you know what they look like, well, his people are mostly related to the Haida, so it's the same kind of style. And he said he dreams in those kind of animals, and can remember his dreams. And he also talks to his grandparents, who taught him how to carve, in his dreams quite often. If he runs into a problem with carving, his grandparents will come and he'll talk to them. But he sees the creatures that he's going to carve living, in an animated sense, in his imagination. I mean, it's not difficult. First of all, I have no reason to disbelieve him. He's a very, very straightforward person. And he doesn't the motivation or the guile, I would say, in some sense, to invent a story like that. There's just no reason he would possibly do it. I don't think he's told that many people about it. He thinks it's kind of crazy, you know? He said when he was a kid, he thought he was insane because he'd have those dreams all the time. About these creatures and so forth. And so it wasn't something he was trumpeting. But I found it fascinating because I can see in him part of the manifestation of this unbroken tradition. We have no idea how traditions like that are really passed along for thousands and thousands of years, right? Part of it's oral and memory, part of it's acted out and dramatized and then part of it's going to be imaginative. And people who aren't literate, they store information quite differently than we do. We don't remember anything. It's all written down in books, right? But if you're from an oral culture, especially if you're trained in that way, you have all of that information at hand. So you can speak and you can tell the stories, and you really know them. You know, modern people don't really know what that's like any more. I doubt if there's maybe more than two of you in the audience that could spout from memory, like, a thirty line poem. You know, and poetry was written so that people could do that. That's why we have that form, is so that people could remember it and have it with them. But we don't do any of that any more. Anyways, back to Jung. Jung was a great believer in the dream, and I know that dreams will tell you things that you don't know. And then I thought, well how the hell can that be? How in the world can something you think up tell you something you don't know? How does that make any sense? First of all, why don't you understand it? Why does it have to come forth in the form of the dream? It's like you're not- there's something going on inside you that you don't control, right? The dream happens to you just like life happens to you. I mean there is the odd lucid dreamer who can, you know, apply a certain amount of conscious control, but most of the time it's you're laying there asleep and this crazy, complicated world manifests itself inside you. And you don't know how. You can't do it when you're awake. And you don't know what it means! It's like what the hell's going on? And that's one of the things that's so damn frightening about the psychoanalysts, because you get this with Freud and Jung, you really start to understand that there are things inside you that are happening that control you instead of the other way around. You, you know, use a bit of reciprocal control, but there's manifestations of spirits, so to speak, inside you that determine the manner in which you walk through life. And you don't control it. And what does? Is it random? You know, there are people who have claimed that dreams are merely the consequence of random neuronal firing, which is a theory I think is absolutely absurd. Because there's nothing random about dreams. They're very, very structured and very, very complex. And not like snow on a television screen or static on the radio. Like, those things are complicated. And also, I've seen so often that people have very coherent dreams that have a perfect narrative structure. You know, they're fully developed, in some sense. And so that theory just doesn't go anywhere with me. I just can't see that as useful at all. So I'm more likely to take the phenomena seriously and say there's something to dreams. Well, you dream of the future and then you try to make it into a reality. That seems to be an important thing. Or maybe you dream up a nightmare and try to make that into a reality because people do that too, if they're hellbent on revenge, for example, full of hatred and resentment. And that manifests itself in terrible fantasies, you know, those are dreams, and then people go act them out. These things are powerful, you know, and nations can get caught up in collective dreams. That's what happened to the Nazis. That's what happened to Nazi Germany in the 1930s. It was absolutely remarkable, amazing, horrific destructive spectacle. And the same thing happened in the Soviet Union, the same thing happened in China, it's like, we have to take these things seriously, you know? Try to understand what's going on. So Jung believed that the dream could contain more information than was yet articulated. Artists do the same thing, you know. People go to museums and they look at paintings, Renaissance paintings, or modern paintings. And they don't exactly know why they're there. I was in this room in New York, I don't remember which museum, but it was a room full of Renaissance art. Great painters, the greatest painters and I thought maybe that room was worth a billion dollars, or something outrageous, because there was like twenty paintings in there, you know? Priceless. And the first thing is, well why are those paintings worth so much, and why is there a museum in the biggest city in the world devoted to them, and why do people come from all over the world and look at them? What the hell are those people doing? One of them was of the Assumption of Mary, beautifully painted, absolutely glowing work of art, and just, like, twenty people standing in front of it, looking at it. You think, what are those people up to? They don't know, why did they make a pilgrimage to New York to come and look at that painting? It's not like they know! Why is it worth so much? I know there's a status element to it, too, but that begs the question: Why did those items become such high status items? What is it about them that's so absolutely remarkable? Well, we're strange creatures. So I was trying to figure out in part, well where did the information that's in the dream come from? Because it has to come from somewhere, and you can think about it as a revelation. Because it's like it springs out of the void, it's new knowledge, it's a revelation. You didn't produce it, it just appears. See, one of the things that I want to do with this series is, like, I'm scientifically-minded, and I'm quite a rational person. And I like to have an explanation for things that's rational and empirical before I look for any other kind of explanation. And I don't want to say that everything that's associated with Divinity can be reduced in some manner to biology or to an evolutionary history, or anything like that. But insofar as it's possible to do that reduction, I'm going to do that. And I'm going to leave the other phenomena floating in the air because they can't be pinned down and in that category of mystical and religious experience, which we don't understand at all. So artists observe one another. They observe people and they represent what they see. And they transmit the message of what they see to us and they teach us to see it. We don't necessarily know what it is that we're learning from them. But we're learning something, or at least we're acting like we're learning something. We go to movies, we watch stories, we immerse ourselves in fiction constantly. That's an artistic production. And for many people, the world of the arts is a living world, and that's particularly true if you're a creative person. It's the creative, artistic people that do move the knowledge of humanity forward. And they do that with their artistic productions first. They're on the edge. The dancers do that, and the poets do that, and the visual artists do that, the musicians do that, and we're not sure what they're doing. We're not sure what musicians are doing. What the hell are they doing? Why do you like music? It gives you a deep intimation of the significance of things. And no one questions it. You go to a concert and you're thrilled, it's a quasi-religious experience, particularly if people really get themselves together and get the crowd moving, you know? There's something incredibly intense about it. It makes no sense whatsoever. It's not an easy thing to understand. Music is deeply patterned, patterned in layers, and I think that has something to do with it because reality is deeply patterned in layers. And so I think music is representing reality in some fundamental way and that we get into the sway of that and sort of participate in being. And that's part of what makes it such an uplifting experience. But we don't really know that's what we're doing, we just go do it. And it's nourishing for people, right? Young people in particular, lots of them live for music, it's where they derive all their meaning, their cultural identity. Everything that's nourishing comes from their affiliation with their music. It's part of their cultural identity. So that's an amazing thing. The question still remains: Where does the information in dreams come from? I think where it comes from is that we watch the patterns that everyone acts out. We've watched that forever and we've got some representations of those patterns. That's part of our cultural history, that's what's embedded in stories, in fictional accounts, of the story between good and evil. The bad guy and the good guy. And the romance, you know? These are canonical patterns of being for people. And they deeply affect us because they represent what it is that we will act out in the world. And then we flesh that out with the individual information we have about ourselves and other people. And so it's like there's waves of behavioral patterns that manifest themselves in the crowd across time. The great dramas are played on the crowd across time. And the artists watch that and they get intimations of what that is and they write it down and they tell us, and then we're a little clearer about what we're up to. A great dramatist like Shakespeare, let's say, we know that what he wrote is fiction. And then we say, well, fiction isn't true. But then you think, well, wait a minute. Maybe it's true like numbers are true. You know? Numbers are an abstraction from the underlying reality but no one in their right mind would really think numbers aren't true. You can even make a case that the numbers are more real than the things that they represent, right? Because the abstraction is so insanely powerful. Once you have mathematics, you're just deadly. You can move the world with mathematics. It's not obvious that the abstraction is less real than the more concrete reality. I mean, take a work of fiction, like Hamlet, and think it's not true because it's fiction. But then you think wait a minute, what kind of explanation is that? Maybe it's more true than nonfiction. Because it takes the story that needs to be told about you and the story that needs to be told about you and you and you and you and abstracts that out and says look, here's something that's a key part of the human experience, as such. Right? So it's an abstraction from this underlying, noisy substrate. And people are affected by it because they see that the thing that's represented is part of the pattern of their being. That's the right way to think about it. And then with these old stories, with these ancient stories, it seems to me like that process has been occurring for thousands of years. It's like we we watched ourselves and we extracted out some stories. We imitated each other and we represented that in drama, and then we distilled the drama and we got a representation of the distillation. And then we did it again and at the end of that process that took God only knows how long- I think some of these stories... They've traced fairy tales back ten thousand years, some fairy tales, in relatively unchanged form. And certainly seems to me that the archaeological evidence, for example, suggests that the really old stories that the Bible begins with are at least that old and likely embedded in a pre-history that's far older than that. And you might think, well, how can you be so sure? And the answer to that in part is that cultures that don't change, like the ancient cultures, like they didn't change as fast as... They stayed the same! That's the answer. So they keep their information moving generation to generation, that's how they stay the same. And so we know, again in the archaeological record, there are records of rituals that have remained relatively unbroken through up to twenty thousand years, was discovered in caves in Japan that were set up for a particular kind of bear worship that was also characteristic of Western Europe. So these things can last for very long periods of time. We're watching each other act in the world. And then the question is well how long have we been watching each other? And the answer to that in some sense is, well, as long as there's been creatures with nervous systems. That's a long time, you know? That's some hundreds of millions of years, perhaps longer than that. We've been watching each other trying to figure out what we're up to across that entire span of time, some of that knowledge is built right into our bodies. Which is why we can dance with each other for example, right? Because understanding isn't just something that you have as an abstraction , it's something that you act out, you know? That's what children are doing when they learning to rough-and-tumble play. They're learning to integrate their body with the body of someone else in a harmonious way and learning to cooperate and compete and that's all instantiated right into their body. It's not abstract knowledge, they don't know that they doing that. They're just doing it. And so we can even use our body as a representational platform. So we've been studying each other for a long time, abstracting out what is it that we're up to, and that's... What is it we're up to, what should we be up to? That's even a more fundamental question. If you're going to live in the world and you're going to do it properly, what does properly mean and how is it that you might go about that? Well, it's the right question, right? It's what everyone wants to know. How do you live in the world? Not what is the world made of. It's not  the same question. How do you live in the world? It's the eternal question of human beings. And I guess we're the only species that has ever really asked that question because all the other animals, they just go and do whatever they do. Not us! It's a question for us. We have to become aware of it, we have to be able to speak it. God only knows why but thats seems to be the situation. So... We act, that acting is shaped by the world, that acting is shaped by society into something that we don't understand, but that we can model. That we can model. We model it our stories, we model it with our bodies. And that's where the dream gets its information. The dream is part of the process that's watching everything and then trying to formulate it and trying to say, well, trying to get the signal out from the noise and to portray in dramatic form. Because a dream is a little drama. And then you get the chance to talk about what that dream is. And then you have it... you have something like articulated  knowledge at that point. And so the Bible I would say is... It's sort of...it exists in that space that's half into the dream and half into articulated knowledge. It's something like that. Going into it to find out what the stories are about, Then... We can aid our self-understanding. The other issue is that if Nietzsche was correct, and if Dostoevsky, or Jung was correct and Dostoevsky as well, without the cornerstone that that understanding provides, we're lost! And that's not good, because then we're susceptible to psychic pathology. That's psychological pathology. You know, people who are adamant anti religious thinkers seem to believe that if we abandoned our immersement in the underlying dream, that we'd all instantly become rationalists like Descartes or Bacon, you know? Intelligent, clear thinking rational, scientific people and I don't believe that for a moment, because I don't think there is any evidence for it. I think we would become so irrational so rapidly that the weirdest mysteries of Catholicism would seem positively rational by contrast and I think that's already happening. So. [CLAPPING] Okay. So, this is the idea essentially, you know, that you have the unknown world. That's just what you don't know at all. That's the outside, that's the ocean that surrounds the island that you inhabit. Something like that, it's chaos itself. And then You act in that world and you act in ways you don't understand. There's more to your actions then you can understand. One of the things Jung said, I loved this, when I first understood it, He said \"Everybody acts out a myth, but very few people know what their myth is.\" And you should know what your myth is because it might be a tragedy. And maybe you don't want it to be. And that's really worth thinking because thinking about because your... You have a pattern of behaviour that characterises you, you know? And God only knows where you got it. Partly it's biological, partly it's from your parents. It's your unconscious assumptions. It's the way the philosophy of your society shaped you. And is, it's aimed, it's aiming you somewhere. Well, is it aiming you somewhere you want to go? That's a good question, that's part of self-realization, you know? We know we don't understand our actions. That's almost every argument you have with someone is about that. It's like \"Why did you do that?\" And you come up with some half baked reasons why you did it. You're flailing around in the darkness, you know? You try to give an account for yourself, but you can only do it partially. It's very, very difficult because you're a complicated animal with the beginnings of an articulated mind, something like that. And you're just way more than you can handle. All right, so you act things out, right? You act things out. And that's a kind of competence. And then you imagine what you act out. And you imagine what everyone else acts out, and so there's a tremendous amount of information in your action. And then, that information is translated up into the dream and into art and to mythology and literature. And there's a tremendous amount of information in that. And then some of that is translated into articulated thought. And I'll give you a quick example of something like that. I think this is partly what happens in Exodus, when Moses comes up with the law. You know, he's wandering around with the Israelites forever in the desert. They're going left and going right and worshiping idols and having a hell of a time. You know, getting rebellious. And Moses goes up on the mountain and he has this tremendous revelation sort of, in the sight of God and it illuminates him and he comes down with the law. You think, well, Moses acted as a judge, I know this is a mythological story. Moses acted as a judge in the desert. He was continually mediating between people who are having problems. Constantly trying to keep peace. And so what are you doing when you're trying to keep peace? You're trying to understand what peace is. Right? You have to apply the principles. Well what are the principles? Well you don't know. The principles are whatever satisfies people enough to make peace. And maybe you do that ten thousand times and then you get some sense of \"Oh! Here's the principles that bring peace.\" And then one day it blasts into your consciousness like a revelation. Here's the rules that we're already acting out. That's the Ten Commandments. They're there to begin with. And Moses comes forward and says \"Look, this is already basically what we're doing but now it's codified, right?\" That's all a historical process that's condensed into a single story but, obviously, that happened Because we have written law! Right? And that emerged, in good legal systems, that emerges from the bottom up. English Common Law is exactly like that. It's single decisions that are predicated on principles, that are then articulated and made into the body of law. The body of law is something you act out. That's why it's a body of law. if you're good citizen you act out the body of law. And the body of law has principles. Okay, so the question is, there's principles that guide our behavior. What are those principles? Well I think if you want the initial answer of what the archaic Israelites meant by God, that's something like what they meant. Now it's not a good enough explanation. But imagine if you're a chimpanzee and you have a powerful, dominant figure at the pinnacle of your society. That represents power, more than that. Because it's not sheer physical prowess that keeps a chimp at the top of the hierarchy. It's much more complicated than that. And you can say, well there's a principle that the dominant person manifests. And then you might say, well, that principle shines forth even more brightly if you know ten people who are dominant. Powerful. And you can extract out what dominance means from that. You can extract out what power means from that. And then you can divorce the concept from the people. And we had to do that at some point because we can say power, in a human context, and we can imagine what that means. But it's divorced from any specific manifestation of power. Well how the hell did we do that? That's so complicated! If you're a chimp, the power is in another chimp, it's not some damn abstraction. So the question is, think about it, we're in these hierarchies, many of them, across centuries. We're trying to figure what the guiding principle is. Trying to extract out the core of the guiding principle And we turn that into a representation of a pattern of being. Well it's something like that that's God. It's an abstracted ideal. And it's put in personified form, manifests itself in personified form, but that's okay because what we're trying to get at is the in some sense, the essence of what it means to be a properly functioning, properly social, and properly competent individual. We're trying to figure out what that means. You need an embodiment. You need an ideal that's abstracted that you could act out that would enable you to understand what that means. And that's what we've been driving at. So that's the first hypothesis, in some sense. I'm going to go over some of the attributes of this abstracted ideal that we formalized as God, but that's the first sort of hypothesis, is that a philosophical or moral ideal manifests itself first as a concrete pattern of behavior that's characteristic of a single individual. And then it's a set of individuals. And then it's an abstraction from that set. And then you have the abstraction. It's so important. So here's a political implication, for example. One of the debates, we might say, between Early Christianity and the Late Roman Empire was whether or not an Emperor could be God, literally, right? To be deified to put in a temple. And you can see why that might happen because that's someone at the pinnacle of a very steep hierarchy who has a tremendous amount of power and influence. But the Christian response to that was, never confuse the specific sovereign with the principle of sovereignty itself. It's brilliant. You see how difficult it is to come up with an idea like that so that even the person who has the power is actually subordinate to something else. Subordinate to, let's call it a divine principle, for lack of a better word. So that even the king himself is subordinate to the principle. And we still believe that, because we believe that our President, or our Prime Minister, is subordinate to the damn law. Whatever, the body of law, right? There's a principle inside that that even the leader is subordinate to. Without that, you could argue you can't even have a civilized society because your leader immediately turns into something that's transcendent and all powerful. That's certainly what happened in the Soviet Union, and what happened in Maoist China, and what happened in Nazi Germany. Because there was nothing for the powerful to subordinate themselves to. You're supposed to be subordinate to God. So what does that mean? Well, we're gonna tear that idea apart, but partly what it means is that you're subordinate, even if you're sovereign, to the principle of sovereignty itself. And then the question is, what the hell is the principle of sovereignty? And I could say, we have been working that out for a very long period of time. And so that's one of the things that we'll talk about. Because the ancient Mesopotamians and the ancient Egyptians had some very interesting dramatic ideas about that. Just for example, very briefly, there was a deity known as Marduk. And Marduk, he was a Mesopotamian deity, and imagine this is sort of what happened is that as an empire grew out the post-Ice Age age, say fifteen thousand years ago, ten thousand years ago, all these tribes came together. And these tribes each had their own deity, their own image of the ideal. But then they started to occupy the same territory, right? And so then one tribe had god A and one tribe had god B and one could wipe the other one out. And then it would just be god A who wins. But that's not so good because, well, maybe you want to trade with those people, or maybe you don't want to lose half your population in a war, something like that. So then you have to have an argument about whose god is going to take priority. Which ideal is going to take priority? What seems to happen is that's represented in mythology as a battle of the gods in sort of celestial  space. But from a practical perspective, it's more like an ongoing dialog. You believe this, I believe this. You believe that, I believe this. How are we going to meld that together? So you take god A and you take god B, and maybe what you do is extract god C from them. And you say, well, god C now has the attributes of A and B. And then some other tribes come in. And then C takes them over too. Like with Marduk, for example, he has a multitude of names. Fifty different names. Well, those are names, at least in part, of the subordinate gods that represented the tribes that came together to make the civilization. That's part of the process by which that abstracted ideal is abstracted. You think this is important, and it works because you're tribe's alive. And you think this is important, and it works, because your tribe's alive. And so we'll take the best of both if we can manage it, and extract out something that's even more abstract that covers both of us if we can do it. One of the things that's really interesting about Marduk, I'll just give you a couple of his features. He has eyes all the way around his head. He's elected by all the other gods to be king god, so that's the first thing, that's quite cool. And they elect him because they're facing a terrible threat. Sort of like a flood and a monster combined, something like that. And Marduk basically says that if they elect him top god, then he'll go out and stop the flood monster. And they won't all get wiped out. It's a serious threat, it's chaos itself, making its comeback. And so all the gods agree and Marduk has a new manifestation. He's got eyes all the way around his head. And he speaks magic words. And then he also goes out and when he fights, he fights this deity called Tiamat. And we need to know that because the word \"Tiamat\" is associated with the word \"Tehom,\" T, E, H, O, M. And Tehom is the chaos that God makes order out of at the beginning of time in Genesis. So it's linked very tightly to this story. And Marduk with his eyes and his capacity to speak magic words goes out to confront Tiamat, who's like a watery sea dragon. Something like that. It's a classic St. George story, go out and wreak havoc on the dragon. And he cuts her into pieces. And he makes the world out of her pieces, and that's the world that human beings live in. And the Mesopotamian emperor acted out Marduk. He was allowed to be emperor insofar as he was a good Marduk. And so that meant that he had eyes all the way around his head, and he could speak magic. He could speak properly. And so we're starting to understand there at that point the essence of leadership, right? Because what's leadership? It's the capacity to see what the hell's in front of your face and maybe in every direction. And then the capacity to use your language properly, in a transformative manner, and to transform chaos into order. And god only knows how long it took the Mesopotamians to figure that out. The best they could do is dramatize it. But it's staggeringly brilliant. You know? It's by no means obvious. And this chaos, this chaos is a very strange thing. This is the chaos that God wrestled with at the beginning of time. Chaos is what- it's half psychological and half real. There's no other way to really describe it. The chaos is what you encounter when you're thrown into deep confusion. When your world falls apart. When you encounter something that blows you into pieces, when your dreams die, when you're betrayed. It's the chaos that emerges. And the chaos is everything at once, and it's too much for you. And that's for sure, and it pulls you down into the underworld and all, that's where the dragons are, and all you've got at that point is your capacity to bloody well keep your eyes open, and to speak as carefully and clearly as you can. And maybe if you're lucky, you'll get through it that way and come out the other side. And it's taken people a very long time to figure that out. And it looks to me like the idea is erected on the platform of our ancient ancestors, maybe tens of millions of years ago. Because we seem to represent that which disturbs us deeply using the same system that we use to represent serpentile or other carnviorous predators. You know, we're biological creatures, right? When we've formulated our capacity to abstract, our strange capacity to abstract and use language, we still have all those underlying systems that were there when we were only animals. And we have to use those systems, they're part of the emotional and motivational architecture of our thinking. Part of the reason we can demonize our enemies who upset our axioms is because we perceive them as if they're carnivorous predators. We do it with the same system. And that's chaos itself, the thing that always threatens us, right? The snakes that hang through the trees when we lived in them like sixty million years ago. It's the same damn systems. So the Marduk story is partly the story of using attention and language to confront those things that most threaten us. And some of those things are real-world threats. But some of them are psychological threats, which are just as profound but far more abstract. But we use the same systems to represent them. It's why you freeze if you're frightened. Right? You're a prey animal. You're like a rabbit. You've seen a something that's going to eat you, you freeze. And that way you're paralyzed, you're turned to stone, which is what you do when you see a medusa with a head full of snakes, right? You're turned to stone, you're paralyzed. And the reason you do that is because you're using the predator detection system to protect yourself. Your heart rate goes way up, and you get ready to move. Things that upset us lie on that system. And then the story, the Marduk story, for example is the idea that if there are things that upset you, chaotic, terrible, serpentine monstrous underworld things that threaten you, the best thing thing to do is to open your eyes, get your speech organized, and go out and confront the thing, and make the world out of it. And it's staggering when I read that story and started to understand it, it just blew me away. That it's such a profound idea, and we know it's true too because we know in psychotherapy, for example, that you're much better off to confront your fears head on than you are to wait and let them find you. And so partly, what you do, if you're a psychotherapist, is you help people break their fears into little pieces, the things that upset them, and then to encounter them one by one and master them. And so you're teaching this process of eternal mastery over the strange and chaotic world. And all of that makes up some of the background for, we haven't even gotten to the first sentence of the Biblical stories yet. [LAUGHTER] [CLAPPING] But all of that makes up the background. So you have to think that we've extracted this story, this strange collection of stories, with all its errors and its repetitions, and its peculiarities, out of the entire history that we've been able to collect ideas. And it's the best we've been able to do. I know there are other religious traditions, but I'm not concerned about that at the moment because we can use this as an example. But it's the best we've been able to do, and what I'm hoping is that we can return to the stories in some sense with an open mind and see if there's something there that we actually need. And I hope that that will be the case. As I said, I'll approach them as rationally as I possibly can. So this is the idea to begin with. We have the unknown as such, and then we act in it, like animals act. They act first. They don't think, they don't imagine, they act. That's where we started, we started by acting. And then we started to be able to represent how we acted. And then we started to talk about how we represented how we acted. And that enabled us to tell stories because that is what a story is, it's to tell about how you represent how you act. And so you know that because if you read a book, what happens? You read the book and images come to mind of the people in the book behaving, right? It's one step from acting it out. You don't act it out because you can abstract and represent action without having to act it out. It's an amazing thing, and that's part of the development of the prefrontal cortex. It's part of the capacity for human abstract thought is that you can pull the behavior, the representation of the behavior, away from the behavior and manipulate the representation before you enact it. That's why you think, so that you can generate a pattern of action and test it out in a fictional world before you embody it and die because you're foolish. Right? You let the representation die, not you. And that's why you think. And so that's partly what we're trying to do with these stories. What do I hope to accomplish? I hope to end this twelve-lecture series knowing more than I did when I started. That's my goal. Because I said I'm not telling you what I know, I'm trying to figure things out. This is part of the process by which I'm doing that. And so I'm doing my best to think on my feet, you know? I've come prepared, but I'm trying to stay on the edge of my capacity to generate knowledge and to make this continually clearer and to get to the bottom of things. I'm hoping that that's what I'm going to accomplish. It seems like people are interested in that, so then we're going to try to accomplish that together. And so that's the plan. And the idea is to see if there's something at the bottom of this amazing civilization that we've managed to construct. That I think is in peril for a variety of reasons. And maybe if we understand it a little bit better we won't be so prone just to throw the damn thing away. Which I think would be a big mistake. And to throw it away because of resentment and hatred and bitterness and historical ignorance and jealously and desire for destruction, and all of that. It's like, I don't want to go there. It's a bad idea to go there. We need to be grounded better. Hopefully, well, we'll see how this works. All right, so how do I approach this? Well, first of all, I think in evolutionary terms, you know? As far as I'm concerned the cosmos is fifteen billion years old and the world is four and a half billion years old. And there's been life for three and a half billion years and there were creatures that had pretty developed nervous systems three hundred to six hundred million years ago. And we were living in trees as small mammals sixty million years ago. We were down on the plains between sixty million and seven million years ago and that's about when we split from chimpanzees. And modern human beings seem to emerge about a hundred and fifty thousand years ago And civilization pretty much after the last Ice Age, something after fifteen thousand years ago. Not very long ago at all, you know? And that's the span across which I want to understand. That's the span across which I want to understand. I want to understand why we are the way we are, looking at life in its continual complexity right from the beginning of life itself. There's some real utility in that because we share attributes with other animals, even animals as simple as crustaceans, for example, have nervous system properties that are very much like ours, and it's very much worth knowing that. And so I think in an evolutionary way. I think it's a grand and remarkable way to think because it has this incredible timespan. It's amazing that people at the end of the nineteenth century, middle of the nineteenth century, say, really thought the world was about six thousand years old. Fifteen billion years old, that's a lot more, right? It's a lot grander, it's a lot bigger, but it's also a lot more frightening and alienating in some sense. Because the cosmos has become so vast, it's either easy for human beings to think of themselves as trivial specks on a trivial speck out some misbegotten hellhole end of the galaxy, among hundreds of millions of galaxies, right? It's very easy to see yourself as nothing in that span of time. That's a real challenge for people. I think it's a mistake to think that way. Because I think consciousness is far more than we think it is, but it's still something we have to grapple with. I'm a psychoanalytic thinker. And what that means is that I believe that people are collections of sub-personalities, and that those sub-personalities are alive. They're not machines. They have their viewpoint, they have their wants, they have their perceptions, they have their arguments, they have their emotions. They're like low-resolution representations of you when you get angry. It's like, it's a very low resolution representation of you. It only wants rage, or it only wants something to eat, or it only wants water, it only wants sex. It's you but shrunk and focused in a specific direction. And all those motivational systems are very, very ancient, very archaic, and very, very powerful. And they play a determining role in the manner in which we manifest ourselves. And as Freud pointed out with the id, we have to figure out how to take all those underlying animalistic motivations and emotions and civilize them in some way so that we can all live in the same, general territory without tearing each other to shreds, which is maybe the default position of both chimpanzee and humanity. So I take that seriously, the idea that we're a loose collection of spirits. You know, it says in the Old Testament somewhere that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and I think this is akin to that. If you know that you're not in control of yourself thoroughly, that there are other factors behind the scenes, like the Greeks thought that human beings were the playthings of the gods. That's the way they conceptualized the world. And they sort of meant the same thing. They meant that there are these great forces that move us that we don't create. That we're subordinate to, in some sense. Not entirely, but we can be subordinate to them, and they move our destinies. That was the Greek view, and there's something... It teaches you humility to understand that. That there's a hell of a lot more going on behind the scenes and you're the driver of a very complex vehicle, but you don't understand the vehicle very well. And it's got its own motivations and methods and sometimes you think it's doing something, and it's doing something completely different. You see that in psychotherapy all the time because you help someone unwind a pattern of behavior that they've manifested forever. First of all, they describe it, then they become aware of it, then maybe they start to see what the cause is. They had no idea why they were acting like that. You know, they have to have the memory that produced the behavioral pattern to begin with. It has to be brought back to mind, and then it has to be analyzed and assessed, and then they have to think about a different way of acting. It's extraordinarily complex. So, psychoanalytic. Literary. Well, there's this new, this postmodern idea about literature, and about the world, for that matter, that you take a complex piece of literature, like a Shakespeare play. There's no end to the number of interpretations that you can make of it. You know, you can interpret each word, you can interpret each phrase, each sentence, each paragraph. You can interpret the entire play. The way you interpret it depends on how many other books you've read, depends on your orientation in the world. It depends on a very, very large number of things. How cultured you are or how much culture you lack. All of those things. It opens up a huge vista for potential interpretation. And so the Postmoderns sort of stubbed their toe on that and thought, well, if there's this vast number of interpretations of any particular literary work, how can be sure that any interpretation is more valid than any other interpretation? And if you can't be sure, then how do you even know those are great works? How do you know... Maybe they're just works that the people in power have used to facilitate their continual accession of power, which is really a Post-modern idea, and a very, very cynical one, but it has its point. But the thing is it's grounded in something real, right? It's like, yes, you can interpret things forever. I want to show you something here, just briefly. We'll go back to it later. Look at this. This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. So at the bottom here, every single one of those lines is a Biblical verse. Okay? Now, the length of the line is proportionate to how many times that verse is referred to in some way by some other verse. So, you say, this is the first hyper-linked book. [LAUGHTER] Right? I'm dead serious about that! You can't click and get the hyper-links, obviously, but it's a thoroughly hyper-linked book and it's because, well the people who worked on these stories that are hypothetically at the end, right? Which is the end can't affect the beginning. That's the rule of time, right? What happens now can't affect what happened to you ten years ago, even though it actually can, but whatever. [LAUGHTER] Well, you re-interpret things, right, and then they're not the same, but whatever, we won't get into that. Technically speaking, the present can not affect the past, but if you were looking at a piece of literature, that's not right. Because when you write the end, you know what was at the beginning, and when you write the beginning or edit it, you know what's at the end. And so you can weave the whole thing together. And there's sixty-five thousand cross-references, and that's what this map shows. And so that's a great visual representation of the book. And then you can see, well why is it deep? Why is the book deep? Well, just imagine how many pathways you could take through that. Right? I mean you'd just journey through that forever, you'd never ever get to the end of it. There's permutations and combinations, and every phrase is dependent on every other phrase and every verse is dependent on every, not entirely, not entirely, but sixty-five thousand is not a bad start. And so Okay, well so that's another issue, in some sense, that seems to make the Post-Modernist critique correct. How in the world are you going to extract out a canonical interpretation of something like THAT? It's like it's not possible. But here's the issue, as far as I can tell. So the Post-Modernists extended that critique to the world. They said look, now the text is complicated enough, you can't extract out a canonical interpretation. What about the world? The world's way more complicated than a text. And so there's an infinite number of ways that you can look at the world. And so how do we know that any one way is better than any other way? That's a good question. Now the Post-Modern answer was we can't. And that's not a good answer because you drown in chaos under those circumstances, right? You can't make sense of anything. And that's not good because it's not neutral to not make sense of things. It's very anxiety-provoking. It's very depressing because if things are so chaotic that you can't get a handle on them, your body defaults into emergency-preparation mode and your heart rate goes up and your immune system stops working and you burn yourself out, you age rapidly because you're surrounded by nothing you can control. That's an existential crisis, right? It's anxiety-provoking and depressing, very hard on people. And even more than that, it turns out that the way that we're constructed neurophysiologically is that we don't experience any positive emotion unless we have an aim, and we can see ourselves progressing toward that aim. It isn't precisely attaining the aim that makes us happy. As you all know if you've ever attained anything, because as soon as you attain it, then the whole little game ends, and you have to come up with another game. Right, so it's Sisyphus. And that's okay. But it does show that the attainment can't be the thing that drives you because it collapses the game. That's what happens when you graduate from university. It's like, you're king of the mountain for one day, and then you're like, serf, at Starbucks for the next five years, you know? [LAUGHTER] So what happens is that human beings are weird creatures because we're much more activated by having an aim and moving towards it than we are by attainment. And what that means is you have to have an aim and that means you have to have an interpretation. And it also means that the nobler the aim, that's one way of thinking about it, the better your life. And that's a really interesting thing to know because you've heard ever since you were tiny that you should act like a good person and you shouldn't lie, for example. And you might think, well, why the hell should I act like a good person and why not lie? I mean, even a three year old can ask that question because smart kids learn to lie earlier, by the way. And they think well, why not twist the fabric of reality so that it serves your specific short-term needs? I mean, that's a great question, why not do that? Why act morally if you can get away with something and it brings you closer to something you want? Well, why not do it? These are good questions, it's not self-evident. Well, it seems to me tied in with what I just mentioned. It's like, you de-stabilize yourself and things become chaotic, and that's not good. And if you don't have a noble aim, then you have nothing but shallow, trivial pleasures. And they don't sustain you. And that's not because because life is so difficult, it's so much suffering, it's so complex. It ends, and everyone dies, and it's painful. It's like without a noble aim, how can you withstand any of that? You can't. You become desperate, and once you become desparate, things go from bad to worse very rapidly. And so there's the idea of the noble aim. And it's something that's necessary. It's the bread that people cannot live without, right? That's not physical bread, it's the noble aim. And what is that? Well, It was encapsulated in part in the story of Marduk. It's to pay attention, it's to speak properly, it's to confront chaos, it's to make a better world, it's something like that. And that's enough of a noble aim so that you can stand up without cringing at the very thought of your own existence so that you can do something that's worthwhile to justify your wretched position on the planet. Now the literary issue is that... look, you take a text, you can interpret it in a variety of ways, but that's not right. This is where the Post-Modernists went wrong because what you're looking for, in a text, and in the world, for that matter, is sufficient order and direction. So then we have to think, well what does sufficient order and direction mean? Well you don't want to suffer so much that your life is unbearable, right? That just seems self-evident. Pain argues for itself. I think of pain as the fundamental reality because no one disputes it, right? Even if you say that you don't believe in pain, it doesn't help when you're in pain. You still believe in it. You can't pry it up with logic and rationality. It just stands forth as a fundament of existence. And that's actually quite useful to know. You say, well, you don't want any more of that than is absolutely necessary. And I think that's self-evident. Then you say, wait a minute, it's more complicated than that. You don't want any more of that than is necessary today, but also not tomorrow and not next week and not next month and not next year. So however you act now better not compromise how you're going to be in a year. Because that'd just be counter-productive. That's part of of the problem with short-term pleasures, right? Act in haste, repent at leisure. Everyone knows exactly what that means. So you have to act in a way that works now and tomorrow and next week and next month and so forth. And so you have to take your future self into account. And human beings can do that. And taking your future self into account isn't much different than taking other people into account. I remember there's this Simpsons episode. And Homer downs a quart of mayonnaise and vodka. [LAUGHTER] And he says Marge says, you know, you shouldn't really do that. And Homer says, that's a problem for future Homer. I'm sure glad I'm not that guy. [LAUGHTER] It's so ridiculous, it caught me, you know? But you see, we have to grapple with that, and so the you that's out there in the future is sort of like another person. And so figuring out how to conduct yourself properly in relationship to your future self isn't much different than figuring out how to conduct yourself in relationship to other people. But then we could expand the constraints. Not only does the interpretation that you extract have to protect you from suffering and give you an aim, but it has to do it in a way that's inerrable, so it works across time, and then it has to work in the presence of other people so that you can cooperate with them and compete with them in a way that doesn't make you suffer more. And people are not that tolerant. They have choices, they don't have to hang around with you. They can hang around with any one of these other primates. And so, if you don't act properly, at least within certain boundaries, it's like, you're just cast aside. And so people are broadcasting information at you all the time about how you need to interpret the world so they can tolerate being around you. And you need that because socially isolate, you're insane, and then you're dead. No one can tolerate being alone for any length of time. We can't maintain our own sanity without continual feedback from other people because it's too damn complicated. So you're constrained by your own existence and then you're constrained by the existence of other people. And then you're also constrained by the world. If I read Hamlet and what I extract out of that is the idea that I should jump off a bridge, it's like it puts my interpretation to an end rather quickly. It doesn't seem to be optimally functional, let's say. And so an interpretation is constrained by the reality of the world. It's constrained by the reality of other people. And it's constrained by your reality across time. There's only a small number of interpretations that are going to work in that tightly defined space. And so that's part of the reason that the Post-Modernists are wrong. It's also part of the reason, by the way, that AI people who've been trying to make intelligent machines have had to put them in a body. Because it turns out you just can't make something intelligent, in some sense, without it being embodied. And it's partly for the reasons I just described. You need constraints on the system before you need constraints on the system so that the system doesn't drown in an infinite sea of interpretation. Something like that. So that's the literary end of it. Moral... Well, morality for me is about action. I'm an existentialist, in some sense. And what that means is that I believe that what people believe to be true is what they act out, not what they say. And so there's lots of definitions of truth. I mean, truth is a very expansive word. And you can think of objective truth but behavioral truth isn't the same as objective truth. What you should do isn't the same as what is, as far as I can tell, but people debate that. But I think the reason that that has to be the case is because... Think about it this way. You're standing in front of a field. And you can see the field. But the field doesn't tell you how to walk through it. There's an infinite number of ways you could walk through it. And so you can't extract out an inviolable guide to how you should act from the array of facts that are in front of you. Because there's just too many facts. And they don't have directionality. But you, you need to know. You need to know how how not to suffer. And  you need to know what your aim is. And so you have to overlay that objective reality with some interpretive structure. And it's the nature of that interpretive structure that we're going to be aiming at hard. I've given you some hints about it already. We've extracted it in part from observations from our own behavior and other peoples' behavior. And we've extracted it in part by the nature of our embodiment that's been shaped over hundreds of millions of years. We see the infinite plain of facts and we impose a moral interpretation on it. And the moral interpretation is what to do about what is. And that's associated both with security because you just don't need too much complexity, And also with aim. And so we're mobile creatures, right? We need to know where we're going. Because all we're ever concerned about, roughly speaking, is where we're going. That's what we need to know. Where are we going, what are we doing, and why? And that's not the same question as what is the world made of objectively. It's a different question and requires different answers. And so that's the domain of the moral, as far as I'm concerned, which is what are you aiming at? And that's the question of the ultimate ideal, in some sense. Even if you have trivial little fragmentary ideals, there's something trying to emerge out of that that's more coherent and more integrated. And more applicable and more practical. And that's the other thing, is that... You know, you think about literature and you think about art and you think those aren't very tightly tied to the earth. They're empyrean and airy and spiritual, and they don't seem practical. But I'm a practical person. And part of the reason that I want to assess these books from a literary and aesthetic and evolutionary perspective is to extract out something of value, something of real value that's practical. You know? Something, because one of the rules that I have when I'm lecturing is that I don't want to tell anybody anything that they can't use. Because I think of knowledge as a tool. It's something to implement in the world. We're tool-using creatures and our knowledge is tools. And we need tools to work in the world. We need tools to regulate our emotions and to make things better and to put an end to suffering to the degree that we can. And to live with ourselves properly, and to stand up properly. And you need the tools to do that. And so I don't want to do anything in this lecture series that isn't practical. Now I want you to come away having things put together in a way that you can immediately apply it. Not interested in abstraction for the sake of abstraction. Rational. Well, it's gotta make sense, you know? Because... the more restrictions on your theory, the better. And so... I want it all laid out causally so that B follows A and B precedes C, and in a way that's understandable and doesn't require a leap any unnecessary leap of faith. Because that's another thing that I think interferes with our relationship with a collection of books like the Bible. It's that you're called upon to believe things that no one can believe. And that's not good because that's a form of lie, as far as I can tell. And then you have to scrap the whole thing because in principle the whole thing is about truth, and if you have to start your pursuit of truth by swallowing a bunch of lies, then how in the world are you going to get anywhere with that? So I don't want any uncertainty at the bottom of this. Or I don't want any more than I have to leave in it. Because I can't get any farther than that. So it's gonna make sense, rationally. I don't want it to be pushing up against what we know to be scientifically untrue, even though we know that science is in flux. And that's somewhat of a dangerous parameter. If it isn't working with evolutionary theory, for example, then I think that it's not a good enough solution. So.. And then, finally, it's phenomenological. Modern people, you know, we think of reality as objective. And that's very powerful. But that isn't how we experience reality. We have our domain of experience. And this is a hard thing to get a grip on, even though it should be the most obvious thing. For the phenomenologist, everything that you experience is real. And so they're interested in the structure of your subjective experience, and you say well you have subjective experience, and you have subjective experience, and so do you. And there's commonalities across all of those, like, for example, you're likely to experience the same set of emotions. We've been able to identify canonical emotions. And canonical motivations, and without that, we couldn't even communicate because you wouldn't know what the other person was like. You'd have to explain infinitely. There's nothing you can take for granted. But you can. And phenomenology is the fact that in the center of my vision, my hands are very clear, and then out in the periphery they get.. they disappear. And phenomenology is the way things smell and the way things taste, and the fact that they matter. And so you could say in some sense that phenomenology is the study of what matters, rather than matter. And it's a given from the phenomenological perspective that things have meaning. And even if you're a rationalist, say, and a cynic and a nihilist, and you say, well, nothing has any meaning, you still run into the problem of pain. Because pain undercuts your arguments and has a meaning. So there's no escaping from the meaning, you can pretty much demolish all the positive parts of it. But trying to think your way out of the negative parts, man, good luck with that, because that just doesn't work. So.. Phenomenology, and the Bible story is, and I think this is true of fiction in general, is phenomenological. It concentrates on trying to elucidate the nature of human experience, and that is not the same as the objective world. But it's also a form of truth, because it is true that you have a field of experience and that it has qualities. The question is what are the qualities? Now, ancient representations of reality were sort of a weird meld of observable phenomena, the things that we would consider objective facts, and subjective truth, the projection of subjective truth. And I'll show you, for example, show you how the Mesopotamians viewed the world. They had a model. Basically the world was a disc. You know, if you go out in a field at night, what does the world look like? It's a disc. It's got a dome on top. Well that was basically the Mesopotamian view of the world. And that view of the world that the people who wrote the first stories of the Bible believed too. And that on top of the dome, there was water. Well, obviously, it's like, it rains, right? Where does the water come from? Well, there's water around the dome. And then there's land, that's the disc. And then underneath that there's water. How do you know that? Well, drill! You'll hit water. It's under the earth, obviously, because how would you hit the water? And then what's under that? There's fresh water. And then what's under that? Well, if you go to the edge of the disc, you hit the ocean. It's salt water. So it's a dome, with water outside of it, and then it's a disc that the dome sits on, and then underneath that there's fresh water, and then underneath that, there's salt water. And that was roughly the Mesopotamian world. And you see, that's a mix of observation and imagination, right? Because that isn't the world, but it is the way the world appears. It's a perfectly believable cosmology. And the sun rises and the sun sets on that dome. It's not like the thing's bloody well spinning, who would ever think that up? It's obviously the sun goes up and goes down and then travels underneath the world, it comes back up again. There's nothing more self-evident than that. Well, that's that strange intermingling of subjective fantasy, let's say, right at the level of perception, and actual observable phenomena. And a lot of the cosmology that's associated with the Biblical stories is exactly like that. It's half psychology and half reality. Although the psychological is real as well. And to know that the Biblical stories have a phenomenological truth is really worth knowing because you know, the poor fundamentalists, they're trying to cling to their moral structure, and you know, I understand why. Because it does organize their societies and it organizes their psyche, so they've got something to cling to. But you know, they don't have a very sophisticated idea of the complexity of what constitutes truth, and they try to gerrymander the Biblical stories into the domain of scientific theory, you know? Promoting creationism, for example, as an alternative scientific theory. It's like, that just isn't going to go anywhere, you know? Because the people who wrote these damn stories weren't scientists to begin with. There weren't any scientists back then. There's hardly any scientists now. [LAUGHTER] You know, it's... really! It's hard to think scientifically, man, it's like, it takes a lot of training. And even scientists don't think scientifically once you get them out of the lab. And hardly even when they're in the lab, you know? You've got to get peer reviewed and criticized and, like, it's hard to think scientifically. So however the people who wrote these stories thought was more like dramatists, more like Shakespeare thought. But that doesn't mean that there isn't truth in it, it just means that you have to be a little bit more sophisticated about your ideas of truth. And that's okay, you know? There are truths to live by! Okay, well, fine, then we want to figure out what those are because we need to live and maybe not to suffer so much. And so if you know that what the Bible stories and stories in general are trying to represent is the lived experience of conscious individuals, like the structure of the lived experience of conscious individuals, then that opens up the possibility of a whole different realm of understanding. And eliminates the contradiction that's been painful for people, between the objective world and, let's say, the claims of religious stories. Okay, so let's take a look at the structure of the book itself. So the first thing about the Bible is that it's a comedy. And a comedy has a happy ending, right? So that's a strange thing because the Greek god stories were almost always tragic. Now, the Bible is a comedy. It has a happy ending. Everyone lives. There's a heaven. Now, what you think about that is a completely different issue. I'm just telling you the structure of the story. It's something like: there was Paradise at the beginning of time, and then some cataclysm occurred and people fell into history, and history is limitation and mortality and suffering and self-consciousness. But there's a mode of being, or potentially the establishment of the state, that will transcend that. And that's what time is aiming at. So that's the idea of the story, you know? It's a funny thing that the Bible has a story, because it wasn't written as a book, right? It was assembled from a whole bunch of different books. And the fact that it got assembled into something resembling a story is quite remarkable. And what the question is then, well what is that story about? And how did it come up as a story? And then, I suppose, as well, is there anything to it? It constitutes a dramatic record of self-realization or abstraction, I already mentioned that. The idea, for example, of the formulation of the, let's say, the image of God, as an abstraction, that's how we're going to handle it to begin with. I want to say, though, because I said that I wasn't going to be any more reductionist than necessary, I know that the evidence for genuine religious experience is incontrovertible. But it's not explicable. And so I don't want to explain it away, I want to just leave it, as a fact. And then I want to pull back from that and say, okay, well we'll leave that as a fact, and a mystery. But we're going to look at this from a rational perspective and say that the initial formulation of the idea of God was an attempt to extract out the ideal, and to consider it as an abstraction outside its instantiation. And so, that's good enough. That's an amazing thing, if it's true. But I don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, let's say. It's a collection of books with multiple redactors and editors. Well, what does that mean? Many people wrote it. There's many different books. And they're interwoven together, especially in the first five books, by people who, I suspect, took the traditions of tribes that had been brought together under a single political organization, and tried to make their accounts coherent. And so they took a little of this, and they took a little of that, and they took a little of this. And they tried not to lose anything, because it seemed valuable, it was certainly valuable to the people who had collected the stories. They weren't going to, you know, tolerate too much editing. But they also wanted it to make sense, to some degree, so it wasn't completely logically contradictory and completely absurd. And so, many people wrote it. And many people edited it, and many people assembled it over a vast stretch of time. And we have very few documents like that. And so just because we have a document like that is sufficient reason to look at it as a remarkable phenomena and try to understand what it is that it's trying to communicate, let's say. And then I said it's also the world's first hyper-linked text, which is that again. And it's very much worth thinking about for quite a long time. All right. There's four sources, in the Old Testament, or the Hebrew Bible. Four stories that we know came together. One source was called the Priestly. And it used the name Elohim or El Shaddai for God. And I believe El is the root word for Allah, as well. And that's usually translated as God or the gods, because Elohim is utilized as plural in the beginning books of the Bible. And it's newer that the Jahwist version. Now, the reason I'm telling you that is because Genesis 1, which is the first story, isn't as old as Genesis 2. Genesis 2 contains, the Jahwist version, for example, contains the story of Adam and Eve. And that's older than the very first book in the Bible. But they decided to put the newer version first. And I think it's because it deals with more fundamental abstractions. It's something like that. It's like, it deals with the most basic of abstractions, how the universe was created, and then segues into what the human environment is like. And so that seems to be the logic behind it. The Jahwist version uses the name YHWH, which apparently people didn't say, but we believe was pronounced something like \"Yahweh.\" And it has a strongly anthropomorphic God, so one that takes human form. It begins with Genesis 2:4. This is the account of the heavens and the earth when, and it contains the story of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, and Noah, and the Tower of Babel, and Exodus, and Numbers, along with the priestly version. It also contains the form, just the form, of the Ten Commandments, which is like a truncated form of the law. The Elohist source contains the stories of Abraham and Isaac. It's concerned with the heavenly hierarchy that includes angels. It talks about the departure from Egypt. And it presents the Covenant Code, which is this idea that society is predicated (this was Israeli society), was predicated on a covenant with God, and that's laid out in a sequence of rules, some of which are the Ten Commandments, but many of which are much more extensive than that. And then the final one is the Deuteronomist code, and it contains the bulk of the law, and the Deuteronomic history. And it's independent of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. And so we know that at least for, now there's debate  about this, like there is about everything, so I'm brushing over a very large area of scholarship, but people generally assume that there were multiple authors over multiple periods of time, and the way they concluded that is by looking at textual analysis, you know? Trying to see where there are chunks of the stories that have the same kind of style or the same referents. And people argue about that because, you know, obviously it's difficult to recreate something ancient. But that's the basic idea. So it is an amalgam of viewpoints about these initial issues. And that's important to know. So it's like a collective story. Okay, now, to understand the first part of Genesis, I'm going to turn, strangely enough, to something that's actually part of the New Testament, and this is a central element of Christianity. And it's a very strange idea and it's going to take a very long time to unpack. But the idea, this is what John said about Christ, he said \"in the beginning was the Word.\" So that relates back to Genesis 1, \"in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" That's some, well, three sentences like that take a lot of unpacking because, well none of that seems to make any sense whatsoever, really, right? In the beginning was the word. And, the word was both with God. And, the word was God. So, the first question might be, what in the world does that mean? In the beginning was the word, that's the logos actually. And the logos is embodied in the figure of Christ. So there's this idea in John that whatever Christ is, the son of God, is not only instantiated in history, say, at a particular time and place, as a carpenter in some backwoods part of the world, but also, something eternal that exists up, outside of time and space, that was there right at the beginning. And as far as I can tell, what that logos represents is something like modern people, something like what modern people refer to when they talk about consciousness. It's something like that. It's more than that. It's like consciousness and its capacity to be aware and its capacity to communicate. It's something like that, and there's an idea underneath that, which is that being, especially from a phenomenological perspective, so the being that is experience, can not exist without consciousness. It's like consciousness shines a light on things to bring it into being. Because without consciousness, what is there? No one experiences anything. Is there anything when no one experiences anything? That's the question. And the answer that this book is presenting is that, no, you have to think about consciousness as a constituent element of reality. It's something that's necessary for reality itself to exist. Now, of course, it depends on what you mean by reality. But, the reality that's being referred to here, I told you already, is the strange amalgam of the subjective experience and the world. But the question is deeper than that too, because it is by no means obvious what there is if there's no one to experience it. I mean the whole notion of time itself seems to collapse, at least in terms of something like felt duration. And the notion of size disappears, essentially, because there's nothing to scale it. Causality seems to vanish. We don't understand consciousness. Not in the least. We don't understand what it is that is in us that gives illumination to being. And what happens in the Old Testament, at least in part, is that that consciousness is associated with the divine. Now you think, well, is that a reasonable proposition? That's a very complicated question, but at least we might know that there's something to the claim. Because there is a miracle of experience and existence that's dependent on consciousness. I mean, people try to explain it away constantly, but it doesn't seem to work very well. And here's something else to think about, I think, that's really worth thinking about. People do not like it when you treat them like they're not conscious. Right? They react very badly to that. And you don't like it if someone assumes that you're not conscious, and you don't like it if someone assumes that you don't have free will. You know, that you're just absolutely determined in your actions, and there's nothing that's going to repair you. And that you don't need to have any responsibility for your actions. It's like our culture, the laws of our culture, are predicated on the idea, something like, people are conscious, people have experience, people make decisions and can be held responsible for them, if there's a free will element to it. And you can debate all that philosophically, and fine. But the point is that that is how we act and that is the ideal that our legal system is predicated on. And there's something deep about it, because you're a subject to the law. But the law is also limited by you. Which is to say that in a well-functioning, properly-grounded democratic system, you have intrinsic value. That's the source of your rights, even if you're a murderer. We have to say, the law can only go so far because there's something about you that's divine. Well, what does that mean? Well, partly it means that there's something about you that's conscious and capable of communicating, like you're a whole world unto yourself. And you have that to contribute to everyone else and that's valuable. That you can learn new things, you can transform the structure of society, you can invent a new way of dealing with the world. You're capable of all that. It's an intrinsic part of you, and that's associated with this. That's the idea there, is that there's something about the logos that is necessary for the absolute chaos of the reality beyond experience to manifest itself as reality. That's an amazing idea because it gives consciousness a constitutive role in the cosmos. And you can debate that, but, you know, you can't just bloody well brush it off. Because, first of all, we are the most complicated things there are that we know of, by a massive amount. We're so complicated that it's unbelievable. And so, you know, there's a lot of cosmos out there, but there's a lot of cosmos in here too. And which one is greater is by no means obvious, unless you use something trivial, like relative size, which, you know, really isn't a very sophisticated approach. And whatever it is that is you has this capacity to experience reality and to transform it, which is a very strange thing, you know? You can conceptualize a future, in your imagination. And then you can work and make that manifest. You participate in the process of creation. That's one way of thinking about it. And so that's why I think, in Genesis 1, it relates the idea that human beings are made in the image of the divine, men and women, which is interesting too, because the feminists are always criticizing Christianity, for example, as being inexorably patriarchal. Of course, they criticize everything like that [LAUGHTER], so it's hardly a stroke of bloody brilliance. But I think it's an absolute miracle that right at the beginning of the document, it says straightforwardly, with no hesitation whatsoever, that the divine spark, which we're associating with the word that brings forth being, is manifest in men and women equally. That's a very cool thing. And you've gotta think, like I said, you actually take that seriously. Well, what you've got to ask is, what happens if you don't take it seriously? Right? Read Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment.\" That's the best... the best investigation of that tactic that's ever been produced Because what happens in Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" is that the main character, whose name is Raskolnikov, decides that there's no intrinsic value to other people. And that as a consequence, he can do whatever he wants. It's only cowardice that stops him from acting. Right? Because, well, why would it be anything else if the value of other people is just an arbitrary superstition? Then why can't I do exactly what I want, when I want? Which is the psychopath's viewpoint. Well, so Roskolnikov does. He kills someone who's a very horrible person, and he has very good reasons for killing her. He's half starved and a little bit insane, and possessed by this ideology, it's a brilliant, brilliant layout. And he finds out something after he kills her, which is that the post-killing Raskolnikov and the pre-killing Raskolnikov are not the same person, even a little bit. Because he's broken a rule, like he's broken a serious rule, and there's no going back. And \"Crime and Punishment\" is the best investigation I know of, of what happens if you take the notion that there's nothing divine about the individual seriously. Now you... Most of the people I know who are deeply atheistic, and I understand why they're deeply atheistic, they haven't contended with people like Dostoevsky. Not as far as I can tell. Because I don't see logical flaws in \"Crime and Punishment.\" I think he got the psychology exactly right. Dostoevsky's amazing for this because in one of his books, \"The Devils,\" for example, he describes a political scenario that's not much different than the one we find ourselves in now. And there are these people who are possessed by rationalistic, utopian, atheistic ideas. They're very powerful. They gave rise to the Communist Revolution. Right? I mean, they're powerful ideas. His character, Stavrogin, also acts out the presupposition that human beings have no intrinsic nature and no intrinsic value. And it's another brilliant investigation. And Dostoevsky prophesized, that's what I would say, what will happen to a society if it goes down that road. And he was dead exactly accurate. It's uncanny to read Dostoevsky's \"The Possessed\" or the \"The Devils,\" depending on the translation, and then to read Alexander Solzhenitsyn's \"Gulag Archipelago\" because one is fiction and prophecy and the second  is hey look it turned out exactly the same way that Dostoevsky said it would for exactly the same reasons So it's quite remarkable. So, the question is: Do you contend seriously with the idea that, A: there's something cosmically constitutive about consciousness, and B: that that might well be considered divine, and C: that that is instantiated in every person. And then ask yourself, if you're not a criminal, if you don't act it out? And then ask yourself what that means. Is that reflective of a reality? Is it a metaphor? Like, maybe it's a metaphor, a complex metaphor that we have to use to organize our societies. It could well be, but even as a metaphor it's true enough so that we mess with it at our peril. And it also took people a very long time to figure out. This is Genesis 1. You know what, I'm probably going to stop there because I believe it's 9:30 And so we didn't even get to the first line. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] Yeah, yeah. Look, I want to read you a couple of things that we'll use as a prodroma for the next lexture I'll just bounce through a collection of ideas that's associated with the notion of divinity And then we'll turn back to the first lines when we start the next lecture. I have no idea how far I'm going to get through the biblical stories, by the way. [LAUGHTER] Because I'm trying to figure this out as I go along. There's an idea in Christianity that the image of God is trinity, right? There's the Father, there's the element of the Father, there's the element of the Son, and there's the element of the Holy Spirit. And something like tradition, the spirit of tradition, it's something like the human being as the newest incarnation of that tradition. Like the living incarnation of that tradition. And then it's something like the spirit in people that makes the relationship with this and this possible. The spirit in individuals. So I'm going to bounce my way quickly through some of the classical, metaphorical attributes of God, so that we kind of have a cloud of notions about what we're talking about when we return to Genesis 1 and talk about the God who spoke chaos into being. So there's a fatherly aspect. So here's what God as a father is like. You can enter into a covenant with it. You can make a bargain with it. Now you think about that. Money is like that. Because money is a bargain you make with the future. So we've structured our world so that you can negotiate with the future. And I don't think that we would've got to the point where we could do that without having this idea to begin with. You can act as if the future is a reality. There's a spirit of tradition that enables you to act as if the future is something that can be bargained with. That's why you make sacrifices. Sacrifices were acted out for a very long period of time and now they're psychological. We know that you can sacrifice something valuable \n in the present and expect that you're negotiating with something that represents the transcendent future. And that's an amazing human discovery. Like, no other creature can do that, to act as if the future is real. To note that you can bargain with reality itself and that you can do it successfully. It's unbelievable. It responds to sacrifice. It answers prayers. I'm not saying that any of this is true, by the way. I'm just saying what the cloud of ideas represents. It punishes and rewards. It judges and forgives. It's not Nature. One of the things that's weird about the Judeo-Christian tradition is that God and Nature are not the same thing at all. Whatever God is, partially manifest in this logos, is something that stands outside of nature. And I think that's something like consciousness as abstracted from the natural world. It built Eden for makind and then banished us for disobedience. It's too powerful to be touched. It granted free will. Distance from it is is Hell. Distance from it is Death. It reveals itself in dogma and in mystical experience. And it's the Law. So that's sort of like the Fatherly aspect. And then the Son-like aspect. It speaks chaos into order. It slays dragons and feeds people with the remains. It finds gold. It rescues virgins. It's the body and blood of Christ. It's the tragic victim and scapegoat and eternally triumphant redeemer simultaneously. It cares for the outcast. It dies and is reborn. It's the King of kinds and Hero of heroes. It's not the state, but is both the fulfillment and critic of the state. It dwells in the perfect house. It is aiming at Paradise or Heaven. It can rescue from Hell. It cares for the outcast. It's the foundation stone and the cornerstone that was rejected. And it's the spirit of the Law. And then it's spirit-like. It's akin to the human soul. It's the prophetic voice. It's the still, small voice of conscience. It's the spoken truth. It's called forth by music. It is the enemy of deceit, arrogance, and resentment. It's the water of life. It burns without consuming. And it's a blinding light. Okay, so that's a very well-developed, poetic set of poetic metaphors, essentially, right? So these are all glimpses of the transcendent ideal, that's the right way of thinking about it. Glimpses of the transcendent ideal. And all of them have a specific meaning. And well, in part, what we're going to do is go over that meaning as we continue with this series. And so what we've got now is a brief description, at least, of what this is. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. We know it's associated with the logos in this sequence of stories. We know it's associated with the Word and with consciousness. And we know that it's associated with whatever God is. And then I laid the metaphoric landscape that, at least in part, describes God. And so now we have some sense of the being that does this: creates the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void. That's that chaotic state of intermingled confusion. The darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. And so we'll stop with that. Because now we're ready to take a tentative step into the very first part of this book. And it's important to have your conceptual framework properly organized so that you can appreciate where it's going and what it might possibly mean. And so, well, I've done what I can today to, what would you say, elaborate on this single word, I suppose. [LAUGHTER] But it's a big word, you know? It's not so unreasonable that it takes a long time to get to the point where you have any sense of what it means at all. All right. That is nowhere near... I thought that I would get a LOT farther than that. [LAUGHTER] All right. So thank you very much. [APPLAUSE] So we do have time for some questions. We have to be out of here at 10:30. It's 9:30, so maybe we'll have questions until someone crazy grabs the microphone and [LAUGHS] Or maybe we'll have questions for half an hour, something like that. So, if anybody has any questions, then, there's a microphone there, and there's a microphone there. I'll try to answer them, to the best that I can. The best of my ability. Let's start. Okay, so you talked about the idea of when you're confronting something that you fear, you face it head on and you destroy it. But then you said that the idea is when you're confronting something, you make the world out of it, and I was wondering if you could just generally expound on what that means. You make your marriage out of the arguments. Okay. You know, you have arguments with your wife, you have arguments with you children. That's that chaotic state. Because no one's been able to formulate a habitable order from that domain of controversy and confusion. And then, through dialogue, you erect a structure that's a house that you can both live in. And so that's the idea, of making the world out of that chaos. And it's frightening because if you really, this is why people often avoid having disputes with people they love, because it's frightening, right? You find out what the person's like and you find out what you're like. It's like, god, who wants to do that? Nobody. And so, your heart rate goes up, and it's confrontation and conflict. And that's because you're encountering that domain that hasn't been properly mapped or configured. And you're doing that with your predator-detection systems, essentially. And so that chaos that threatens the stability, say, of the marriage, is equivalent to, well, it's equivalent to the serpent in the tree, that's one form of equivalence. And then, by dialogue and negotiation, you formulate the problem. What exactly's going on here? Where exactly are we? What exactly is the problem? And so you keep talking until you reach a consensus about that, one that you can live with, one that you can act out. Right? And maybe you come up with the solution to the problem, and you've established peace again. Peace, that's the house that you can both live in. And that's the chaos that people can fall into all the time, and often do. And it's the chaos that makes a marriage wash up on the shores and transform into, like, fifteen year divorce court. A very horrible thing. So, that's the idea. Okay, thank you. Okay. [APPLAUSE] Hi Dr. Peterson, thank you so much for the talk and thanks for your teachings. It's really helped me a lot. I had an experience in grad school, two English degrees, and the way you described the humanities, in my experience, helped me understand my experience back then. So thank you. That's too bad, that's too bad that that happens to be the case. Really, you know, that's not good. [LAUGHTER] You don't have to tell me that. Yep. But, you know, I survived, and I learned a lot Yep. And I'm not ungrateful for my experience, I've learned a lot. But you said something, you described the collection of stories in the Bible in an interesting way, and I wondered if it was on purpose. You described it as an assembly of stories created by many people, over time, that's hyper-linked, into itself. And it sounds a lot like a description of how the Internet works. Yeah, well it's not accidental, because the Internet's also a collective endeavor. God only knows what personality it's going to manifest. But it's going to manifest some personality because it's learning to understand us very, very rapidly. So I think there's no reason not to think about it as a pre-cursor. The distance between the Bible and the Internet is a lot less than the distance between a chimpanzee and a human being. And the difference between a book and the Internet is also, in some sense it's a matter of degree rather than kind. [UNINTELLIGIBLE] I can't speculate, because God only knows what's going to happen in the next twenty years. I certainly don't. I don't know what the pre-conditions are for consciousness. I have no idea. And I don't think anybody knows. So, I guess we're gonna find out. Yep. [APPLAUSE] Hi Dr. Peterson. I'm curious about the connection between aesthetic  beauty and religious experience. I think you've hinted at it once or twice over the course of this lecture. Is it possible for something that's incredibly beautiful to evoke a religious or mystical experience, or something in the same ballpark? I think that's what they're for. If you look at the structure of a Renaissance cathedral, That's literally what I was just going to... that's my tag-on question to the next part was is that why we have cathedrals built like a spectacular buildings, as opposed to... Yeah, well if you're going to house the ultimate ideal, you build something beautiful to represent its dwelling place. And it should be beautiful. And this is something that people do not take seriously. This is especially something we don't take seriously in Canada. I mean, you think about all the hundreds of millions of dollars that were invested into beauty in Europe. I mean, spectacular, excessive investment in beauty that's paid back God only knows how many multiples of times. People make pilgrimages to Europe constantly because it's so beautiful that it just staggers you. Beauty is so valuable, and we're so afraid of it. And I think we're afraid of it because it's a pathway, it's not the only pathway to the divine, I mean, there's pathways to the divine. Love is one of them, I suppose. But beauty, especially for people who have an affinity for beauty, it's like music. It's one of those things that we can't argue against, right? You can't even understand, it just hits you. And it shows you the ideal, that's one way to think about it. But it also shows you, I think, it's like a vision of the potential future. It's something like that as well. That if we just got our act together and beautified things, that that's the place the we could inhabit. And that would ennoble us, and that's why Jerusalem, the heavenly city, is paved with gemstones, you know? They're crystalline, they emit light, it's the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness. Beauty is the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness. And we ignore it at our spiritual and economic peril. It's obvious that beauty, there's almost nothing more valuable than beauty. Economically, practically, right? So, yeah. Why that is, who knows? You know? Why we experience gemstones, for example, as beautiful, it's very mysterious. There're deep reasons for it. [APPLAUSE] Hi. I have a bit of a similar question, actually. I know that one of the ways in which the Bible is appreciated, even by some of its harshest critics and deeply atheistic people, is as a work of literature and as something, at least the King James authorized translation of the Bible, as something very aesthetically beautiful. And a great work of literature and a great work of poetry. And I'm wondering, just from your study of it, and from your personal perspective, if there's any particular passages or parts of it that have struck you that way, or that you cherish more than any others, that you would be able to share. Well the ones that have really opened up to me, I think, are the stories in Genesis. Right up to the Tower of Babel, because I think, well, and hopefully I'll talk to all of you about that, but I think I've got some sense of what they mean and why. I know it's not exhaustive, obviously, but the story in Exodus as well. I also feel like I've got a handle on that. And so those have hit me really, really hard. And just trying to understand this first part of Genesis, to try to understand what these concepts mean has been Especially when I started to understand that the concept that human beings are made in God's image, that God has all those attributes that we just described, that human beings are made in God's image, that that's actually the cornerstone of our legal system, that really rattled me. Because I didn't understand that clearly, that our body of laws has that metaphysical presupposition, without which the laws fall apart. And that's starting to happen, it really is. You know, like the post-modern critique of law. The law schools are, I would say, they're overrun by post-modernists who are undermining the structure of Western law as fast as they possibly can because they don't buy any of this. And so they're much more likely to just think of the law as something, like a casual pragmatic tool to be manipulated for the purposes of bringing forth the utopia. It's a really, really, really bad idea. So it's very strange to me that we go off track when that metaphysical foundation starts to get rattled. Do you think your appreciation of the aesthetic beauty of it comes from a belief in the truth in the underlying proposition? I mean, that's, because even the atheistic critics that I'm thinking of, like, even Dawkins or Hitchens, really appreciate the Bible as just a piece of really beautiful literature and just the quality of the writing, even if they totally reject the premise of it. Yeah, well I don't think that you can see it as beautiful and poetic AND reject the underlying premises because if you see it as beautiful and poetic, you're accepting the underlying premises with your experience of the beauty and the poetics, even though you may be fighting it with your articulated rationality. So I that indicates is a dis-integrated perspective on the book. And it's not surprising that that's the case, it's the perspective that everyone has on the book, except with them it's more well-developed and well-thought-through. But I think it's fundamentally... They're not approaching the thing with enough respect, that's my sense. And who knows, right? I don't know. But what I've tried to do is to think there's probably more to this than I know. And then tried to understand it from that perspective, rather than to think, for example, well, it's a collection of superstitions that we've somehow outgrown. It's like, no, sorry, that's not a deep enough analysis. Because it's got some truth, but it doesn't take into account the fact that the propositions still stand at the foundation of our culture. It doesn't address Nietzsche's central concern, which is that if you blow out the notion of God, the entire structure crumbles. You can debate that, fine. But I'd just as soon that you debated it with Nietzsche, because he's a pretty tough customer to tangle with. I don't think the atheist types, insofar as there's a type, I don't think they've wrestled with the real problems. Yeah. [APPLAUSE] So I appreciate you set up some ground rules to keep things rational, and I think that's going to help us. What I'm wondering is, so for instance, you said elsewhere, the New Testament, from what you can see, it's psychologically correct. And that's quite astounding, I would say. There's a lot of truth in your depiction to these stories, elsewhere. You've pointed out deep truths, real powerful. So what my question would be is if we can say Nietzsche took an order of magnitude of intelligence and depth to be able to predict what would happen in the next century, rationally, if the Bible's not the inerrant word of God, what's going on? That's a good question. That's a really good question, and I'm going to try that rationally. But, as I said, I don't want to leave people with the notion, because you know, some ways, this is something I've been thinking about a long time, is I can't tell if I'm an advocate of the religious viewpoint or its worst possible critic. Because I am doing my best to make it rational, and there's a reductionistic element to that. But I think that I'm doing that while also leaving the door open to things that I don't understand. Because that there's more to this story than I understand or can understand. And I'm laying out what I can understand and I'm making it rational, but I do not believe for an instant that that exhausts the realm. It's like there are ways of interpreting these stories that work in the conceptual universe we inhabit right now. But there's a lot of things that we don't understand. One thing I found about digging into these stories is that the deeper you dig, the more you find. And that's one of the things that convinced me that there was more to them than I had originally suspected. Because things would click, and I'd think, wow, that's really something. And then I would take it apart further, and I'd think, oh, well, I thought THAT was something, but this is even more remarkable. It just keeps opening and opening. So I'm gonna make it rational. I'm going to try to provide an answer to, and I think you're right about speaking about Nietzsche and his capacity for prophecy, and Dostoevsky's in the same category. It's like there are prophetic elements to the Old and New Testament that seem to stretch over much vaster spans of time. And I'm going to try to produce a rational account of that. But, I mean, one of the reasons that I think the New Testament is \"psychologically true,\" let's say, is because, and this is one of the things that's deeply embedded in the structure of the Bible. In the Old Testament, there's this idea, and I'm skipping ahead, that through a succession of states, the people who behave properly will eventually establish the proper state. And so the state is viewed, in some sense, as the entity of salvation. But what happens in the New Testament is that idea gets, you could say, deconstructed. And instead of a state being the place of redemption, a state of being becomes the test of redemption. And so the idea that human beings will be redeemed moves from the utopian state vision to the responsibility of the individual. And I think that's correct. I believe that that's the right answer, and I think that the West, in particular, is predicated on that idea. Because it makes the state subservient to the individual. I mean there's a continual dialogue, but in the final analysis the locus of the divine is the individual and not the state. And I believe that's so true that if we don't act it out and believe it, then we all die painfully. And that's true enough for me. So. [APPLAUSE] I thank you for the illuminating talk. I'm going to keep you on the creation story, and if you don't mind, because we know this editing that was done, there was a purpose for the editing. Can you give us your thoughts about the differences in the story of creation, especially pertaining to man, from the first chapter, which is very God-like, you know, by a word? And to the second one, which is more like a fatherly type of creation. Is it the selling point? What was the reason for this type of editing to put the two together, one of them? Well, I think that the more cynical criticisms of the Bible and the religious tradition, for instances like Marxists or Freudsian, for that matter, make the case that it's a manifestation of power and politics. And that there's always a political or economic motivation behind the construction of the stories. And I think that that's true to some degree. But I don't think that it's true enough so that you can take that particular interpretive tack and be done with it. And I would say that to the degree that there are political and economic motivations that have shaped the stories, the fact that multiple stories have come together, they're sort of corrective in some sense, and so even if at the level of detail, there's political intrigue and politics, say, with regards to the ascendancy of Israel, when you step away from it, it becomes something that's more universal and escapes from that. And how that happened, I don't know. I mean, I think it's safe to say, it's reasonably safe to say that the people who put this document together, they did two things. I think they were guided by their aesthetic taste and their conscience. I truly believe that. And the reason I believe that is because I think anything that was propagandistic would have been forgotten. Because you can't remember propaganda. No one likes it, it's like it's dead ten years after you write it, or twenty years. And it isn't only that these books were assembled and written, it was that they were preserved and remembered. And to me that means they have an affinity with the structure of memory. I mean, you think about it. How does the story last ten thousand years unless it's the kind of story you can remember? It doesn't, because you forget all the forgettable stuff. And all you remember is the memorable stuff. And so there's this interplay between the document itself and its audience that shapes the document. Now, I don't know how specifically I answered your question. We're going to hit the different stories as they come up in sequence and I think I'll shed some more light on the relationship between them doing that. And we'll start with that next week. [APPLAUSE] Right, so um I've been really interested in a lot of the stuff that you've been saying about dreams because I've been lucid dreaming a lot for many years. But always in a sort of atheistic way, as sort of like a game or something like that. But because of seeing your talks and everything, I've started to think of it from a different perspective, like you're now interfacing with something beyond the narrow scope of your conscious awareness, or something like that. Maybe mythological or something like God. And so what I've been thinking about, and what I've maybe wondered what you'd think about, is that, in some ways, when you're lucid dreaming, you're getting beyond the limitations of a normal dreamer, sort of transcending limitations, which maybe is not the purpose of people, right? Because as a person, you're supposed to be limited in some ways, as opposed to God, who's not limited. And how, but on the other hand, it's a good opportunity to kind of have control over your interactions with this very special, interesting thing. So I guess the conundrum is that on one hand, you can control your interactions, but on the other hand, you ARE controlling them. So I guess I'm wondering what you think about that, and also just in general what do you think about lucid dreaming as a thing, like, should you do it? I had a client who could really lucid dream, you know? And one of the things, she used them now and then to solve problems, even though she didn't always pay attention to the answer. Sometimes she did. In one of her dreams, one of the characters told her that she would have to learn to live with a slaughterhouse. She was very afraid of life, and one of the consequences of that was that we went and watched them bombing. So but one of the things she did, she'd ask the characters what they were up to, you know? She was, instead of controlling, she would inquire. And so but I don't know what to say about lucid dreaming beyond that. I know it's a well-documented phenomena and many people can do it, and women seem to be able to do it better than men, that's what the research indicates. But I think that what we don't know about lucid dreaming could fill a lot of books. So, I think there is some danger in controlling it, because you lose the spontaneous revelation, although not completely because you can't control it completely. You might be interested in reading Jung's books on active imagination. Because he kind of learned to dream when he was awake. And he spent a lot of time in the world of imagination when he was awake, the Red Books, for example. Red Book is a document of his experiences with awake dreaming. But he was very interactive with the dream, you know, instead of trying to bend it to his whim or his will. He was exploring it, in some sense, like you'd explore a video game. Which are forms of dreams in and of themselves. Yeah, I would say do it with an exploratory purpose in mind. You could always ask yourself what you could learn, too, which is a very dangerous question to ask a dream. Because sometimes you'll find out what you have to learn. That's not so pleasant. But it's really worthwhile. [APPLAUSE] Okay, so I think I'm going to take four more questions, only, because I'm running out of brain, and I don't want to say stupid things, or stupider things than I've already said, so. Yeah, thank you for the talk. So in the beginning of your lecture, you talked about how society need this kind of dream-like religious base so we don't go between left and right violently, and we can kind of have this base. And then you also said you admired Nietzsche for kind of chopping down these ideological and kind of dogmatic needs coming up from the base of Christianity. And I was wondering what your thoughts are on how society can this kind of religious base without having these kind of dangerous ideologies that kind of spring up once in a while. That's what I'm trying to figure out. No, really. That really, that's the serious answer to that question. You know, I mean, the reason that i'm an admirer of Nietzsche is because he was the spirit of his times, that's a good way of thinking about it. It's not like Nietzsche killed God. It's that Nietzsche gathered what was in the air and articulated it, right? Incredibly profoundly, and so he put his finger on the spot. And in doing so, he announced the problem. And once you announce the problem, then maybe you can come up with a solution, because you can't solve a problem unless you know what it is. The fact that he made it so stark and so clear is horrifying in some sense, but at least we know where we stand. And so, since then, and I would say in many ways particularly with the work of Jung, and everything that's come out of that, which is the deeper study of mythology and its meanings, we've been trying to address the issue that Nietzsche brought up and trying to solve the problem. The problem is something like the reunification of the spirit of mankind, it's something like that. We're slogging through it, man, that's why you're all here, at least in part, so we'll see how far we can get. By this rate, we'll get to, like, the twelfth verse in the first [LAUGHTER] but that's the aim, you know? Okay? [APPLAUSE] Yes, they'll be in the video. I can also make them available as slides. Yeah, well that's okay. I'll return to this when we get going again. So. Yeah, different colors represent the distance between the cross-references, yeah. Well, I'll talk about that more next time. I mean, I think that then best answer to that is I'll talk more about that next time. [LAUGHTER] I mean I think of them as overlapping metaphorical domains. You know, in the descriptions I put of the fatherly aspect, the son aspect, and the spirit aspect, you could swap a lot of those. You know, it's kind of arbitrary. But I think the Trinitarian idea is trying to get forward the notion that the locus of the Divine is the same thing in its essence, but it exists in a multiplicity. It exists as the spirit of tradition. It exists as the living individual, in time and space, and then it exists as the spirit. And its consciousness, that we all share. Which, you know, Jung would have thought about that as something like the capacity for the individual to realize the tragedy and redemption of Christ in their individual life. And that's something like your capacity to voluntarily accept the tragic conditions of your existence and to move forward to something resembling Paradise, regardless of that. You know, as something that's intrinsic to you. And I think that's associated with the idea of the Pentecost. And the Holy Spirit, all of that, it's, so that's as good as I can do in a short period of time, so. Yep. [APPLAUSE] I think it's because of the gap between what we articulate and what we don't know. Something has to fill that gap. I think the law could replace it if the law is total, but it isn't. It's bounded and incorrect, and it has to rest on something inside that's like this mediator between what we articulate and what we don't understand. It's something like custom. It's something like expectation. It's something like the intrinsic sense of justice. You know, that the law itself is aiming at. And those aren't fully articulated. But without them there'd be no grounding. Like, without the body, the law would be a dictionary . And if you don't know what a word means, using a dictionary is helpful, but not that helpful, because unless you've had the experience of anger, the dictionary can't tell you what anger means. It just refers to other words. But the words themselves refer to something else. And the law refers to something else. And without that, it has to be in tune with that something else, it has to be in accordance with it. And so I don't think we can ever delineate the proper body of laws and that's also why ideological utopias, see, ideological utopias dispense with the transcendent. They say, \"This is what we need to do.\" It's like no, you don't know. That's not good. You have to leave space for what you kind of know and what you don't know. And in the story of the Tower of Babel, human beings make this massive building that's supposed to reach up to the heavens so that it'll take the place of God. Well that's the earliest warning we have of the danger of making things so vague that you confuse them with God. And God gets irritated and comes down and makes everybody speak different languages and scatters them. It's like, well, that's what happens when you try to make something a totality, is that it starts to fragment inside and disintegrates into catastrophe. So we have to maintain this articulated space inside the dream inside the custom, something like that. Because otherwise it doesn't work. And I think that's the same as having respect for the fact that we have bodies. You know, we're not just abstract creatures that follow rules. We're not that at all. You only follow certain rules. We won't follow the other ones, and our societies will crumble. And so, we just don't know enough to articulate the entire landscape of behavior with articulated rules, not at all. We can't do it, it's beyond us. [APPLAUSE] Hi, thanks for the talk. My question is also about dreams. You spoke about dreams as like a representation of truths and universal truths that can be interpreted into, like, myths and religion. And, as you say it, it's very beneficial for the individual, and it sounds like also for society as well because not everyone can as easily remember their dreams, or interpret their dreams. And also it's broadcasted to all of society for their benefit. So I guess I'm wondering what the evolutionary advantage of dreams are and my question might be, do you think that dreams suggest some sort of evolutionary group selection, such that groups that don't have these dreams that are represented into myths and legend, do you think they didn't survive as well? Okay, so I'm not going to answer the second part of that question because I'd have to go far too far off at a tangent for me to manage right now. But I can answer the first part. What happens when you're dreaming, there's a little switch, so to speak, in your brain that shuts off when you're dreaming and it stops you from moving. Right? It shuts everything off except your eyes, because if you're moving your eyes back and forth, you're not going to run around and get eaten by a lion. It's okay to move your eyes. But the rest of you is staying exactly where it is. Then you can run these simulations. And so what's happening at night, and this is a fairly well-accepted theory of dreaming, we know that dreams update memories and help consolidate memories. They also help you forget. But what seems to be happening at night is you're running the underlying architecture of your cognitive ability in different simulations. And it's cost free because you're paralyzed. You're not running around out there out in the world, investigating. So it's part of the manner in which your brain experiments with the way the world can be represented. And so it seems absolutely necessary. I mean, if you deprive people of REM sleep, they don't stay sane very long. There's something necessary about the dreaming process to maintenance of articulated sanity. So you're doing some sort of organization at night when you descend into that chaos. Partly what seems to happen is that your categories have boundaries, right? But sometimes you don't have the categories correct. And so the boundaries have to loosen and other things need to be put into categories with some things shunted away. And in the dream, the category structure loosens, which is why dreams are so peculiar. But they're experimenting. Your mind is experimenting with the underlying categorical structure of imagination. And trying to update your mode of being in the world. Dreams often concentrate on things that provoke anxiety. So if you wake people up when they're dreaming, the most commonly reported emotion is anxiety. So the dream is like the first stages of the attempt to contend with the unknown. So the dream is half unknown and half known. Which is also why it's so peculiar, you know, because you kind of understand it, but you don't really. And it partakes of the unknown and the known. And it's the bridge between the two, something like that. [APPLAUSE] Um, okay, so my question is kind of two parts. The first one is just like a general question, and then just the application of the question. So my first question is, do you think that consciousness and being-hood are inextricably linked? And then secondly, so if there something like a super-computer that one could house, theoretically, a perfect brain of a person in it, does that thing then become the same person as the person it was before. So is there a transcendency to being-hood but not to consciousness? Okay, so the first question is, well, I would say that the kind of being that these stories are concerned with is absolutely dependent on consciousness. Now whether or not that means that being as such is dependent on consciousness actually depends on how you define being. So it's always tricky when you ask is a, here's an example of meaning. Those are tricky questions because it depends on how you define the two. But for our purposes the being that we're discussing, that's represented in these stories, is intrinsically associated with conscious experience. And consciousness is given this constitutive role, the experience that we're talking about would not exist if consciousness did not exist. So you can think about it as sort of a game, in a way, and then you have to decide for yourself whether that's a game that can be generalized. And I won't answer the second part, okay? If you don't mind. [LAUGHTER] All right. [APPLAUSE] So, two part question. First one's very quick. If we want to read the Biblical stories that kind of you're referring to as a particular version, edition, source, publisher... Oh I'll bring the thing I like next week. I think the Reader's Digest published it of all things. It lays out the narratives in a different format. It's easier, I find it much easier to read. So I'll bring it next time and show it to you. My other question is, one of the main reasons why I'm interested in so much of your work and I think many are as well, is you leave literalism in the door and you open up another door to a much more deeper meaning. In your interview with Transliminal Media, you mentioned Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] book, the serpent, uh, the tree, the serpent... Yeah, yeah. And you note that we as a species are very good at recognizing camouflage patterns of snakes, particularly in the lower field of vision. And you further note that visual acuity is correlated with that and that it co-evolved. And you summarized thusly by saying the following, I'm paraphrasing you, you said \"What gives you vision? Snakes do.\" \"That's what it says in Genesis. What else gives you vision? Fruit. That's also right.\" \"That's why we have color vision. What makes you self-conscious if you're a man? Woman. That's Eve.\" And so, I understand at the elementary level some of the concepts that you have about representations, dreams, abstractions, etc. But it kind of raises the question for me, I'm not accusing you of any creationism or literalism. Yep. You know, what's your point? Why did you make that connection? What's the meaning of the story of Genesis vis-a-vis Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] book? No problem. As soon as I get past this first, this one, we're going to hit that hard. [LAUGHTER] So [APPLAUSE] Well, partly Yes, I'm suggesting that it foreshadowed it. And I think they're the same thing. I mean Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in her books plays with that idea, metaphorically, but she never really takes it seriously, which is no problem. I mean there's only so much you can take seriously, and she did a fine job of what she did. But I'll talk about that a lot. That's a very complicated issue. I mean, I would say, to begin with, that the systems that you use to deal with radical uncertainty are the same systems that your primate ancestors evolved to deal with snakes. That's a good start. So, okay? Okay. One more, and then we're done. [APPLAUSE] I'm an aerospace science engineer and an expert computer programmer, and I have three rapid-fire questions so I'm going to get to them quick. Based on your opinion of where the universities now stand in terms of humanities and social sciences, is mathematics more powerful than articulated speech? I'm not exactly sure how the first... Oh, well, it depends on what you mean by power, I guess. I mean, it's obvious that studying mathematics and computer science makes you insanely powerful. The question is: to what end? And I don't think that you can extract an answer to that from the study of mathematics. The humanities are there to ground people in proper citizen-hood. That's a way of thinking about it. Yes it makes you powerful, but then the question is, who has the power? Because it might not be you. It might be the mathematics, so to speak, you know? Because you never know what you're an agent of. Precisely. And so... Yeah, well, look, I've got nothing against computer programmers, more power to you guys. And mathematicians as well, but I... Yes, it has to be a tool of something. And what the humanities were for was to tell people what the tools should be used for. And so the tools themselves are crazily powerful. But that's not necessarily an un-trammeled good, so. I have to stop, because... okay, quick. [LAUGHTER] Okay, you were in this one room in New York where you had seen some original Renaissance artwork masterpieces and these are generally accepted as amazing artifacts. Does an original work of art, as opposed to a high-fidelity reproduction, contain the spirit of the artist who created it, and does this account for the disparity in how much you have to pay for them? It does in part. I know a good portrait artist, okay? And one of the things he pointed out about a great portrait is that it actually contains time. Because a photograph is one instant. But portrait is you layered on you, layered on you. So it's got a thickness. You know? And I think you can see that thickness in the original, but it's also a direct manifestation of that creative act of perception. I don't think you get that, you just can't get the fidelity of the original with the reproduction. But there's more to it than that too, because the painting doesn't end with the frame. You know, like we tend to think of the painting itself as the object, but most objects are densely innervated with historical context. And you can say, well, the historical context isn't the object, but it depends on what you mean by the object. And often people, when they buy a painting, are buying the historical context. You just don't get that with a reproduction. It's a kind of magic. It's like, you want to have Elvis Presley's guitar or another guitar just like it? Well, you want to have Elvis's guitar. Why? You can't tell it's Elvis's guitar by looking at it. [LAUGHTER] Well, it is at the level of detail, but not at the level of context. That's how it looks to me. Okay, we gotta go.

comes to you know shopping for groceries or a convenience store things like that you've seen I think more and more the 1 liter bottles of water or soda and you've also seen gallons of me half a gallon on one full gallon but you probably have suspected when it comes to looking at those beverages that a liter is less and smaller than a gallon so in terms of conversions you have two completely different kinds of numbers here but the one thing I want to keep in mind it will take a little getting used to is the fact that one liter is equal to zero point two six four gallons that's right one liter is actually just a little more than a quarter of a gallon so basically one gallon is going to be around four liters so that pretty much answers the question for you so I'm Jimmy Chang and one liter is equal to how many gallons", "DtGK6u-9ydI": "hey every ants in today's video I'm going to be talking about olaplex and unless you've been living under a rock I'm sure you've heard of it so it's been absolutely revolutionary for the hair industry and the salon world I've had clients a message me and asked like where can i buy it and olaplex is an in salon service that you can get done so it's basically an additive to your bleach or your color that's going to prevent your hair from breaking and it's going to give it basically more lift or more lightening because you're not damaging the hair so like I've said before say you want to go from brunette to blonde and that's normally not possible in one day because you're jumping so many levels that that would cause a lot of breakage and as most hairdressers would probably not want to damage your hair most hairdressers would probably say that's not possible we can't do that in one appointment so now with all Plex what you can do is you can leave the bleach on the hair longer and instead of breaking the hair you're actually almost keeping it in a better condition because basically the technology behind olaplex is that it basically links the bonds back together so when you bleach the hair bonds are broken and that's just how the chemistry of it goes but with olaplex it links them back together so leaving you with healthy hair if not healthier than when you started so the way it works is this was more technical this is more for hairdressers but basically if you are going to be using a 20 volume developer you would use a 30 volume developer in this case instead because the oval Plex dilutes the potency basically if you're developer a little bit so you go one level up on the developer and you use a portion of the olaplex and so that's just mixed in there and apply it to the hair just like any other color service then there is the step two and again that's an insulin service this is what we do at the shampoo bowl once you are done processing and we're ready to shampoo your hair this is the first step even before shampoo so you just rinse the hair of the color or the bleach on your hair and you apply this and you leave it on for 10 minutes so this is a bond Perfector and that is step number two then also there is the step number three and step number three what it is is that it's a take-home treatment for your client so you give this to your client and the client uses it for the next couple of shampoos at home so again just like the step two you put it on the hair before you even shampoo leave it on the hair for a couple of minutes rinse and then shampoo and condition like you would normally it leaves you with so many more possibilities and so much more that you really feel like you can create with the color assortment that you already have in the bleach that you already have so it really is like a little magic wand that we can kind of just use if you follow me on Instagram and my social media and you've seen the pictures I post of the clients that I have done everyone is always amazed at how bright I can get a client and not just how bright but how beautiful that bright blonde looks and we all know that blonde thrives and healthy hair you can get someone really light in a day but if it's not beautiful luminous like lustrous like that light just bounces off of it it's never going to be a beautiful color and that's why you need healthy hair in order to have beautiful blonde hair and that's just what it is so I've been doing so many colors that I don't even need a toner sometimes and nuts there's anything wrong with using toners I personally love toners but I've had even a hairdresser that's like what toter Jesus on that hair that color was beautiful and it's really just the old Plex just because it lifts you so beautifully that it you know you don't even need it so absolutely every client that I've used it on I have not had a client yet that you know was like oh I did probably didn't need it they absolutely all love the results they love that they can finally go blonder than it they ever have been possible to so even clients that I've been seeing for a while and you know the is they're blond but they're not like that blond that we want to get them to but I will not go any lighter because you know I fear for the integrity of their hair so and with all plex we've gotten them they're so really really is super exciting stuff it's exciting for stylists and obviously exciting for the client that is getting you know finally their dream blonde and their dream lightness of color obviously it can be used with color as well even if your going much brighter but it still delivers that same bond perfecting and bond builder so still a great thing to get in the hair even if you're not lightning so started offering it in my salon as of April I know many places have been using this for probably a year almost or so but I wanted to get training in all effects and I took classes in it before and few workshops and I really just wanted to get the full-on knowledge and really the background I wanted to understand it chemically and all of that and why does it you know you're telling me that it does this but I want to know why so after I did all of that I knew that I was Freddy and finally wanted to have it in the salon so now that I have it I figured I would share with you my experience with it and just how truly amazing this product is if you are in the San Francisco area and you want to try it out go ahead and text the number I will leave in the description box or if you would like to book an appointment and you will see for yourself just how amazing it is anyway thank you so much for watching if you've tried olaplex please leave

kids thanks for stopping by my channel working on things that kind of pop up and random randomly just kind of loading it up on YouTube because you never know who you can help if I helped five people hey you've made my day because it's all about saving money my tourists I got a check engine lights come on now it started coming on a couple days ago after I started working on it and it's actually right down there and I've got a couple of codes here got the old Pio one-seven-one and Aon famous Pio c 174 bank one bank to a two lean now it only means one thing that it means that air is getting into the engine unwanted air is getting into the engine or perhaps moisture is getting into the engine and it's causing the o2 sensors to see the extra fuel and air and coming on in freaking out and said hey I don't like you anymore I don't like what you're giving my engine so now the thing we have to do is determine where it's leaking and possibly what is leaking now one thing we can rule out probably pretty fast on these cars especially this tourists this goes just for about any car those codes are related to like I said air intake and fuel mixture and sometimes moisture check your coolant level first thing have you had any coolant loss over the last six months over the last week or two any unusual coolant loss well if you don't then more likely it's not a gasket issue it's probably going to be an air leak perhaps your intake gasket is getting bad or you've just got a dry rotted hose somewhere a lot of times on some of the explorers that I've worked on you can still have a intake gasket it's bad you really won't notice the coolant level that much the loss because the engine takes so much cool it it takes a half a gallon to lose it before you actually realize it that it's gone down and so in the smaller cars sometimes you get lucky and you notice it right away but like I said I know my intake gaskets are okay because they were replaced not long ago so that does help me out so I've got a sneaky suspicion I've got a hose off or something as dry rodded up here so what we're going to do first thing you can do is blend get you can of carburetor spray and we're going to kind of spray this in some areas and see if the engine changes rpm and if it does and they'll give us some idea of perhaps what is that going on now remember if you have a spark plug that's sparking arcing don't spray this stuff why it's running how you will cause a nasty little explosion this stuff is a highly flammable and when you spray it spray it right near you want and don't spray it too long the idea is kind of we want to get the spray in there if it is sucking in extra air it'll mix the mixture up and it'll cause the engine to stumble maybe drop a little rpm and you can kind of get an idea of where the leak might be so let's go and start to step because I don't have a lot of time on this cell phone to shoot I'm shooting it in HD so we're going to start it up and see what we get out here like this running pretty good by the way it's about 95 degrees at here September so it's pretty warm and I wanted to angle the car and a light where you can kind of get a good idea and see what's going on so just to verify I'll go ahead and spray around my intake gasket if I notice any difference in the rpm you can see that it's been that stuff battery's pretty fast so you don't want to spray too much too long alright this seems to be okay still owling pretty good now I've got some vacuum lens over here it's a few things over here check around your throttle body make sure you know and also through heaven air cleaner make sure that this clamp is tight I've seen a lot of cases where this clamp is loose in a suction extra air up in this area and it will throw the check engine light on the whole idea of this all the air that comes into this engine is managed right here to this tensor and you got to make sure that the air that comes in only passes through here if you have any other air leakage it's going to cause your check engine light to come on it's gonna throw well code like I said the o2 sensor will see it so that's the whole idea so we'll just keep spraying around here my EGR valve back here it seems to be okay nothing there everything's tight there I got some more hoses that could a lot of the hoses that car just a air conditioning and heating system vacuum lines I've got 3 gr valves that Pearson hoses oh did you hear that it stumbled there when I sprayed that I think we found our problem this right here a little bit that's okay that's okay I think we found I found the problem right here help I hear hissed and right here hear that there's a problem right here Yeah right there we got a worn-out hose on the PVC valve here so let me set this engine off van just kick won by the way I'm doing this out here in the parking lot away from my house because we're mowing grass today and it's noisy and now I get the bikers everybody's enjoying the last few warm days we got left okay now it's a little quieter alright now here is my issue I just found wow that thing is really flimsy it's sucking extra air on the backside here this is what's causing my extra air to come in the engine and the check engine light on so I want to have to get a clamp stick on a Telia that's the nesting way tools I should be tight because these engines run off of a Vette thing called a vacuum map sensor which mine is right here and this thing is always testing the air for vacuum pressure so any extra air gets in here drops a vacuum pressure and that engine computer doesn't like it so there we go so let me see if I can find the clamp and stick on it alright I got me a little clamp on there I kind of put that on there I sprayed some cleaner on there clean it up real good and now it's on there nice and tight and all the other hose I've checked I don't see no issue and we had started up and I think I probably found a problem which is sort of a surprise is if we have any more hissing that's much better I can put my hand back here move it around it doesn't hiss no moral Streisand cleaner honor engine doesn't change speed no more so I think I found my problem or I should say fixed all right all I'm gonna do I'm gonna drive this for a few days and I'll check back with you guys here and I'll let you know how it went okay so I'll give me a couple of days all right day three and good news is my light has never come back on it seems to be doing pretty good I've been driving in town a lot stop and go and get on the highway a little bit that seems to be okay so just make sure you take that piece out of there and when you take that piece out there's some smaller hoses on the back make sure they're not cracked or maybe busted because sometimes it's kind of hard to see back there but that's how you check for those codes that's one way I should say but just get you some starting fluid and get out there and start listening and even get you a hose put up to your ear and a little garden hose and kind of stick down there net will help you out too so thanks for watching the video and my next project is the fuel pump I don't know if you can hear it

King Edvard, Queen Paige,\nmay I present my daughter's fiancee, Mr. Kah Rado.  Pleasure, Mr. Rado.  The pleasure is mine. Having the royal couple from\nDenmark here for my wedding is quite an honor.  We were just\ndiscussing your wedding.  Princess Myra. Ah, yes, it will\ncertainly be a spectacle. I leave that all up to Myra. I know nothing of\nflowers or ceremony. King Edvard, how do\nyou like Sangyoon?  It's a beautiful country. We're very pleased to be here.  But our customs\nare so different, surely you disagree\nwith some of them.  As I'm sure you disagree\nwith some of ours.  Ha, I told you. He's come with an agenda. Let me guess?\nThe Red Ming?  Kah.  Yes. Yes, I disagree with the\ntreatment of these people. I hope to speak to\nKing Saryu about it.  Well, as you cry tears\nfor these poor peasants, they rebel against the king. Just last week they tried to\nburn down one of my factories. They reach out for help to\nall the other countries, telling lies about their own.  No, they reach out for\nhelp because they're dying.  You know nothing\nof our problems.  Enough. Now is not the time\nfor such discussions.  Myra, tell me, how did\nyou and Mr. Rado meet?  They met at the day\nof their engagement.  The king and I\nmade arrangements about six months ago. I had the privilege of meeting\nthe princess the very next day.  I mean, can you\nimagine someone choosing who you're going to marry?  Paige, it's their way.  But it's not Myra's way. Look at her, she's miserable.  Well, you don't know that.  Eddie, she's known\nhim for a month. I mean, not to mention\nhe's kind of terrible.  Yes. No, he's not the\nmost charming man in the world, that's for sure. But it does make\npolitical sense. Kah Rado is one of the\nrichest men in the country. With Sangyoon's lagging economy,\nit might be a good match. What?  Why do I feel like\nyou're not as outraged about this as you should be?  Look, I'm not saying I\nagree with arranged marriages. But it's common practice in\nAsia and many other places around the world, you know that.  I know, but it doesn't\nseem right in this case.  Well, I can't very\nwell go and tell the king that I don't like his\nchoice in son-in-law, can I?  No, I guess not.  Listen, I love that you care. I love that you want to\nhelp wherever you can. But this is out of our hands.  Eddie, are you awake? Eddie, I can't sleep. I think it's the jet lag. Eddie.  [gasps] Hello?  Be careful.

Isn't it beautiful, Eddie?  Yes.  All right, I'm\ngoing back to sleep. Very nice. What?  Oh, dear.  You didn't tell\nanyone, did you?  Just you.  Oh, dear.  We can't get in\nthe middle of this.  His name is Alu. He works in the stable. They grew up together. She loves him.  She told you that?  Yes, last night after\nyou went to sleep. Her father won't listen to her. Eddie, she begged\nme to help her. We can't let her marry Kah.  Well, we came here to\nattend their wedding, not break them up.  It would be\ndifficult to discuss the Red Ming situation if you\nwere thrown out of the palace. [clears throat]  Yes, I want to help them too. But Eddie we can't just\nignore what's going on. What if it were you and I? You know as well as I\ndo that if your parents had to choose your\nwife, it certainly wouldn't have been me.  All right.  Sir?  Well, she's right, Soren. The princess asked\nQueen Paige for help. We can't ignore her. I will speak to the king. It won't be very well\nreceived, but I'll try.  Thank you.  Well, this has international\nincident written all over it.  The overall procession\nwill start at 2:00. The king will give his\nblessing to the union, and then the entire\nwedding party will move out into the street.  Like a parade?  Thousands of people are\nalready waiting to catch a glimpse of Princess Myra.  You should speak to him\nbefore the procession. [music playing]  It's beautiful.  Thank you. Everything before you is mine\nor soon will be, am I right? [music playing] [applause]  Good morning, Your Majesty.  Oh, good morning.  Gorgeous day, isn't it?  It is, yes.  Oh, King Saryu,\nmay I have a word?  Of course. But first, I have a\nvery important matter to discuss with the queen.  Me?  Yes, come please. Our traditions go back\nthousands of years. We have honored them. And in return, good fortune\nhave blessed our people. I would ask you to\njoin me in a rite to bless my daughter's wedding.  Of course, I would be honored. I've never been this close\nto real life elephant before.  They smell just as I imagined.  May I introduce Kayla. Kayla is a part of our family. She is a descendant\nof the first elephant that honored our kingdom. On Myra's wedding day, she\nwill ride on Kayla to the altar and good luck will be bestowed\nupon the couple and our people. But today, we offer\nthe honor to our guest. Queen Paige, will you ride\non Kayla through the streets of Sangyoon?  On her? I mean, of course. But oh her?  I am so pleased. Kayla is as well. You can see it in her eyes. Do not worry, Alu will be\nright there by your side. Now, if you will excuse\nme, we must begin.  [clears throat] Shouldn't you?  Oh, well, can\nI not watch you--  Eddie, go.  OK, just-- just be careful.  I'll watch for you, sir.  I will help you\nup, Your Majesty.  Thank you. Alu, I'm going to try\nand help you and Myra.  Thank you.  International incident.  Soren. OK, Kayla, you and I are\ngoing to become great friends.  Your Majesty, I really\nneed to speak to you.  King Edvard, I appreciate your\ncompassion for the Red Ming, but the situation is much more\ncomplex than you may realize.  Yes, I look forward\nto that discussion, but I actually\nneed to talk to you about something more personal. It's actually rather delicate.  Yes?  Uh, well, the queen, my\nwife, she had a talk with Myra, quite a long talk actually. And it turns out that,\nwell, neither of them feel that Kah is the right\nman for your daughter.  I beg your pardon?  Sir, I just don't believe\nthat Princess Myra loves him.  [non-english speech] [huffing] [elephant trumpets]  Ah!  This is going on\nmy Facebook page.  Why do we speak of love? What does a young girl know\nabout what's good for her?  Well, a lot.  My marriage to the late queen\nwas arranged by our fathers. The years before she passed\nwere the happiest of my life.  Ooh, there went my blouse. Ah, OK.  Well done, Your Majesty.  I think you could\nenjoy this a little less.  Myra?  You will obey me.  Alu, no. Don't do anything foolish. We're going to\ntalk to King Saryu.  It's too late to talk.  Alu, no!  I'm soon to be your husband. Your father has decreed.  Kah is very wealthy and\nwise to the way of the world. He can take care of her.  Yes, but isn't there more\nto a happy marriage than that?  Keep your hands off her!  No! Don't hurt him.  Excuse me. [inaudible]  Excuse me, Your Majesty.  Wait.  Alu, please. Stop! [non-english speech]  Let him go.  Your Majesty, I believe\nthat international incident I was predicting is\nhappening as we speak.  No, no, Soren, wait!  He's had enough!  Keep your hands off me.  Gladly.  Alu, what's the\nmeaning of this?  Your Majesty, I'm in love with\nyour daughter and she loves me. I cannot allow her\nto marry another.  You cannot allow? Who are you to allow anything?  Uh, [non-english speech] Oh, good girl, Kayla. There goes the rest of my shirt.  What is this behavior? Haven't I treated you well\nsince you were a child?  King Saryu, this is treason. This peasant assaulted the\nfuture king of Sangyoon.  Alu was trying to\nprotect Myra from you.  (ANGRILY) What?  I would change my tone\nwhen speaking to the queen if I were you. Your Majesty, Mr. Rado\nwas extremely rough with your daughter. I would have done the same as\nthis boy had I been closer.  Your Majesty, where's Kayla?  She's right-- She was right there. I guess she just wandered off.  Wandered off?  Oh, dear.  Take him away.  Father, no!  Silence. He has lost the sacred elephant. He must pay the price.  Alu!  Queen Paige, please show\nus where you last saw Kayla.  Of course.  According to the book of\nlaw, without the elephant the marriage will be cursed.  I don't understand. How could she just disappear?  Well, apparently,\nelephants can run at over 24 kilometers per hour.  Really?  Well, it's all in that\nfact sheet on Sangyoon and I gave you. Do you two ever read\nanything I give you?  Over here, Your\nMajesty, over here.  Her tracks lead north.  The Red Ming are\nfrom the north. You should send in the army\nimmediately, Your Majesty, and make an example\nof these criminals.  Your Majesty, there\nis no reason to assume that a crime has occurred here.  Just a coincidence,\na Red Ming peasant leaves the elephant alone. And now her tracks lead\ntowards their village. Your highness,\nit's a conspiracy.  This is very upsetting. A bad omen on the week\nof my daughter's wedding. I must think. Excuse me.  I feel terrible.  Darling, you are not\nresponsible for losing the elephant.  It's sacred to them, Eddie.  Well, I'm sure\nthey don't blame you.  Well, they're not very happy\nthat you lost their elephant.  See?  I don't think they're going to\ncharge you for it or anything.  Soren. Yes, well, King\nSaryu has decided to send the army\nto retrieve Kayla and to punish\nthose who took her.  This doesn't make sense. These people have always\nbeen peaceful, right? Do you know anything\nabout this boy Alu?  Alu had nothing to do\nwith Kayla's disappearance. He's been a part of this\nhousehold since he was a child. He's not a rebel. He's a lovesick boy.  This is all my fault.\nWe came here to help them, and now we've made it worse.  Your Majesty, I hear\nyou're sending in the army.  An example must be made.  Isn't this rash?  The Red Ming committed a\ncrime and Alu helped them. Now they will pay the price.  Wait, Your Majesty, what if-- what if we got her back.  Pardon?  Your Majesty.  What if you waited\nto send in the army? Let us try to find her\nand bring her back.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, she's got a point. We could bring her back.  You're going to wander\ninto our jungles alone? You wouldn't last a day.  I will lead\nthem, Your Majesty. I can track the elephant and\nlead them through the jungle safely.  Please, Your Majesty, hold off\nthe army for a couple of days.  We'll bring her back. She can still bless\nMyra's wedding. And perhaps Alu could be spared.  Sir.  At sunset on Saturday, my\ndaughter will be married. If you return Kayla\nbefore that time, we will spare Alu\nand the peasants.  Your Majesty, but if\nyou fail or you are late, Alu will stay in jail, and\nI will send in the army to exact revenge for this crime.  Sir, I question\nthe wisdom of this-- this venture.  Why?  Well, we know nothing\nof the geography, we know nothing about\njungles, and, quite frankly, we know nothing about elephants.  Well, we haven't got much\nchoice, really, have we?  I have an idea. We could just get on\na plane and go home.  Uh, where do you\nthink you're going?  Where do you think\nI think I'm going?  I hope it's not where I\nthink you think you're going.  Could we stop that, please.  Didn't we talk\nabout this last night?  Yes, I remember you\ndoing a lot of talking. I don't recall agreeing with\nanything you were saying.  Paige, you are the\nqueen of Denmark.  And you are the king, so what?  Well, what if you get hurt?  I'm a doctor. What if you get hurt?  She's got you there, sir.  Look, it's my fault\nKayla disappeared. I'm coming.  Any chance I could\nchange your mind?  Nope.  Well, can I drive at least?  Yes.  Well, I suppose\nthe jungle is as good a place to die as anywhere.  Your majesties.  Yeah?  Sir, it seems your security\ndetail is about to put a stop to our little adventure.  Right. [engine sputters] [engine revving]  What are you smiling about?  Am I?  Yes, you are. You're enjoying this.  Well, it makes a change from\ntalking politics, doesn't it?  Yes, certainly a\nrespite from the mundane when you get to drive around\nwith a woman on the hood.  Stop.  Well, that's a lawsuit.  Sorry.  She went this way.  She's quite tough, isn't she?  I think she could beat me up.  So do I.  Kayla entered the jungle here.  So it's back to\nthe plane, then?  No. We follow her.  Your Majesty, the\njungle is very dangerous. There's no turning\nback past this point.  We go where Kayla goes.  Well, what are we waiting for? Soren?  Do you really think we'll\nbe able to find this elephant?  Yes.  Right. Oh, I do too. I mean, you obviously\nknow what you're doing. So, um, uh-- Does it seem very hot to you?  Do you ever get tired\nof being so proper?  No. Yes.  Eddie, are you being\ncareful with that thing?  Um, I think I know\nhow to use a machete.  Oh, get a lot of practice\ncutting through the jungle, do you?  Ah, see we adventurous\ntypes, we've got instincts.  Yeah, well, don't\ncut your leg off. I left my surgical bag at home.  Well, thanks for\nyour concern, but I believe I'm quite capable.\n- Whoa! Eddie!\n[thumping] [exertion sounds] Eddie! Are you hurt?  Just my pride. Be right up. No, can't.  Sir, it appears to be too\nsteep for you to climb out.  Does it, Soren? Really, does it?  Look out. We're losing daylight. [music playing]  Dry your eyes, my love.  What are you doing here?  You know in time\nyour childish feelings for that criminal will fade. And you will come\nto care for me.  He's not a criminal. He had nothing to do with\nKayla's disappearance.  You're young and naive and\nyou know nothing of the world.  I know that I don't\nlove you and I never will.  What does love matter? Your family connections,\nmy business sense, that is what's important. Together we'll make\nSangyoon a financial center.  All you care about\nis money and power. You've been lying to\nme about the Red Ming ever since we've met. When the king and queen\nreturn with Kayla, they will see through your lies.  They will not return\nwith that creature. You know how dangerous\nour jungles can be. Good day, princess. Quickly, I have a special\nassignment for you. [whispering]  Something wrong?  Looks like we're lost.  We're not lost, are we, Rayen?  I know what lost looks\nlike and it looks very much like this.  Give me a moment,\nYour Majesty.  Hey little guy. [monkey chattering] [monkey chatters]  Paige?  Oh, you like that, huh? Uh-huh. Yeah, right. Kayla. Eddie!  Paige! - Eddie, hurry.\n- Are you all right? Did you fall? Are you OK?  I'm OK. Eddie, look what I found.  Great.  Eddie, it's Kayla's costume.  Oh.  Nice work, Your Majesty.  So we're not lost after all. I always had the\nutmost confidence.  It must have been knocked\noff by one of these branches.  Or removed by elephant\nkidnapping bandits. Devil's advocate.  I found the trail again. This way.  What's that for?  For being worried about\nme and for being my hero.  Come on. [suspenseful music playing]  It will be dark soon. We'll camp here.  But there's still daylight.  The jungle gets very\nchallenging at night, Your Majesty.  No, she's right. I imagine Kayla will be having\na little sleep, too, won't she?  Yes, Your Majesty. I'll get some wood. Thank you.  Right, in we go then.  Soren. You all right?  Yeah.  What's wrong?  I just-- this is all my fault,\nKayla missing, Alu and Myra.  Listen, we'll find her, OK? And it will all be\nall right, promise.  They do that a lot. Yes, well, um, I was just\nthinking about dinner. I've got a variety\nof canned foods. And do you have any special\ndietary requirements I should be aware of? I say, nice work.  I'll get some water.  Right.  Eddie?  Mm-hm.  I hear something.  What? [non-english speech]  Look, just calm down. Soren, do something. Say something. Say something Sangyooni.  I only know how to say hello,\nnot please don't shoot us.  Soren.  Ming-gala-bah.  I think he speaks English.  On your knees now!  [screams] [non-english speech]  [groans] [exertion sounds]  Run, Your Majesty!  [grunts] [exertion sounds] [groaning] [thuds] [exertion sounds]  Pretty bloody impressive.  Rayen, are these men Red Ming?  No, they wear the uniform\nof the Royal Sangyoon Army.  The army? Who would send\nthe army after us?  Why don't we ask them?  Um, excuse me, hello. Oh, they're not waking up. - Oh.\n- Ouch.  Gracious.  Who are you and\nwhat do you want? [non-english]  In English.  We were ordered to\nstop you from returning with the elephant.  Ordered by whom? The king?  I'm not telling\nyou anything more.  Why would the king\nsend the army after us?  Well, I bet it\nwasn't the king.  I bet it was Kah.  Sir, are we sure we want to\nthrow all those rifles away?  Your Majesty, I\nfound her tracks. This way.  Well, we're pretty\nlucky Rayen is with us, actually, aren't we?  Come on, Soren, you know\ngood guys don't carry guns.  Right. Well, who needs rifles anyway? Unless, of course, the\nbad guys have rifles. But why would the\nbad guys have rifles? Except, of course,\nthey do have rifles. [suspenseful music playing]  Lieutenant, do you copy?  Still nothing?  No.  Help!  Let's go! Come on! [non-english speech]  She's amazing, isn't she?  Oh, absolutely.  The way she can track based\non a broken blade of grass. I've never seen\nanything like it.  Good fighter, too.  Did you see that jump kick? And the machetes, incredible.  Yes, I saw. She's really beautiful, too.  Hm? Yes, well, she's-- Rayen.  Good job, Your Majesty.  I'm taking a survey. Has anyone ever been this\nhot in their entire lives? Anyone?  Its fresh. We're close.  What's fresh? Oh. That's disgusting. Did she just touch that? That's just really unsightly.  The trail ends here.  Right, so Kayla\nwent for a swim.  Does this mean we\ncan take a break?  No, we swim across.  It's not safe. We don't know what's\nin that water.  You mean like\ncrocodiles and stuff?  I've seen a few. Further north, but--  No, she's right. We'll just find a\nbetter place to cross.  And how long is\nthat going to take?  Hello.  We only have two\ndays to return Kayla. And for some reason\nwe have armed soldiers trying to stop us. We don't have time to\nlook for a better spot.  Hey, we all want to find\nKayla but we can't be reckless.  Oh!\nExcuse me. Excuse me. Someone, anyone, please? Yeah, I'm quite in fear\nfor my life over here.  Just because she says it isn't\nsafe doesn't mean it's true.  Well, she knows the river. It seems like she would know\nwhether it was safe or not.  OK, I guess she's\njust really smart and she's just really,\nreally good at everything. I guess we should just\ndo whatever she says.  Don't do anything\nto frighten it, OK?  Are we still fighting\nabout the river?  We're not fighting,\nwe're discussing.  It feels like a fight.  S-- S-- Sorry, you have\ndone this before? - I-- no.\n- No? No? Well, you might have\nkept quiet about that.  It's not a fight. It's a very important\ndiscussion about how you've been drooling over Rayen.  What?  [screams] [hissing] [grunting]  Oh, thank you. Why are you looking\nat me like that?  You make me laugh. Your majesties, if you wait\nhere I'll find a bridge or another safe place to cross.  Right, it's a good idea,\nbut you shouldn't go alone. I'll come with you. Paige, will you stay\nhere with Soren?  Fine.  Won't be long, OK?  Fine.  About an hour.  Fine.  Fine.  Would you like something\nto eat, Your Majesty?  No, thank you, I'm not hungry.  I could try and\nfind that snake again. I understand they're\nquite a delicacy here. Is there something\nwrong, Your Majesty?  Yes. No. I don't know. It doesn't even matter, but I\nthink that all of this trouble started because of\na mistake I made.  You didn't do anything wrong.  I know it's not my fault,\nbut it feels like it is. And now I'm just sitting\nhere feeling alone.  He loves you\nwith all his heart.  Would he love me more if I\nwas better at tracking elephants and could handle a machete?  My queen, that is simply-- Your Majesty?\n- Yes?  I think we may have a problem.  We're surrounded. [non-english speech]  I mean, what am I supposed\nto do, just let her go swim in the river with who\nknows what in there, crocodiles, snakes, those\nfish with teeth, what are they called?  Piranha.  Yeah, piranha.  Mainly found in South America.  Not the point. The point is that--  She just wants to know\nyou love and respect her.  Well, of course I do.  You should remind her.  Yeah, I suppose I should. You're pretty\nclever, aren't you?  I majored in\npsychology at Oxford.  Right. I'm gonna climb that tree, get\na better view of the river.  Oxford, eh?  Yes.  It's a good school. A tracker, ninja-fighting\npsychologist from Oxford. Don't see them every day. All right, here I go.  Careful, Your Majesty.  Oh, don't worry about me. I'm quite the\nprofessional tree climber. I can see a boat. It's about a\nkilometer over there.  Eddie!  Paige! [non-english speech] The soldiers have\ngot Paige and Soren.  What? Your Majesty, careful.  They're loading\nthem onto a boat. [non-english speech]  This doesn't look good. I'll go so far as to\nsay that this is bad.  Slow down!  [screams]  Your Majesty, are you OK?  Paige!  Eddie! Eddie! [non-english speech]  Paige!  Your Majesty, wait!  Paige! No.  Wait! Edvard, stop!\n- What?  We can't catch up\nwith them like this. We need a boat.\n- I saw a fishing boat. OK, let's go.  Hello. Hello. Over here. Can you-- can you\nhelp us, please? [non-english speech] [non-english speech]  Let's try up\nthere to the left. [non-english speech] [non-english speech]  Let her go!  Help! Help!  Keep moving.  We have the queen\nand the servant. Are you sure, sir? No, sir, I'm not questioning\nyour orders, sir. Yes. I understand, sir. Halt.  This doesn't look good.  Sir, sir, I want you\nthink very carefully about what you're about to do.  Quiet, I have my orders.  From who? Kah Rado? He is not your commanding\nofficer, King Saryu is. Speak to him, you must.  I'm sorry.  Sir, are you absolutely\nsure you're taking your orders from the right person? [elephant trumpeting] [shouting]  Kayla!  Go! Go, go, go, go, go! [elephant trumpets]  Queen Paige?  Yes.  Whoa, Queen Paige! [cheering]  Queen Paige!  I never thought I'd be\ngrateful for the tabloids.  It's getting dark.  Rayen, there!  I see it.  Rayen, come on.  Your Majesty, we need to\nroll out the royal guard.  What?  How long is that\ngoing to take? A day, two days?  We have no idea where\nthey're taking them or what we're walking into.  Now, I realize this\nis not your fight, but that is my wife\nand friend out there. I'm not leaving them. You don't have to help me. But don't even think\nabout trying to stop me.  OK, as you wish. But they won't get far at night. And I can't track them\ntill the sun is up. Your Majesty, I'm sorry. [non-english speech]  Myra. Myra.  Sh. The guards let me in.  Myra, you should not be here. Someone might see you.  I had to come. I had to see you. Are you all right?  I am strong. And they are not unkind. They know me.  Alu, the king and queen\nhave still not returned. We're running out of time.  Myra, no matter what\nhappens, I love you. I will always love you. I will love you till\nthe end of time. [non-english speech]  Go. Go, go. Someone's coming.  Alu, I will never forget you.  I'm awake. It's a tribal village. The tracks lead straight there. We must be careful. [music playing] [elephant trumpets] Kayla. Kayla, where have you been? I've been so worried.  Stay here. I'm gonna try and find Paige.  Are you all right? I missed you, too. [non-english speech]  Sh, sh, sh.  [moaning] - Eddie.\n- Are you OK? - I'm OK.\n- You're OK. I was so worried about you.\nIs Soren OK?  Yeah, Soren's OK. We're both OK.  All right. All right, uh, OK,\nthis is the plan, you, me, Soren, get\nout of here, OK.  Eddie wait.  Sh. They've got Rayen.  King Edvard, it's all right. You can come out.  It's the Red Ming. They're our friends. They saved us.  What?  Your Majesty. His name is William. At least I think\nthat's what he said.  What's going on here?  They're sick, Eddie.  I'm Tonquin. Thank you for coming. Please. The weak of the village\nare getting sick, more get sick each day.  I can't figure it out. I thought it was malaria,\nbut it doesn't seem to fit.  We have asked others for help,\nbut you are the first to come. I knew when Kayla came to us\nshe would bring a good fortune.  She came to you?  They said she just wandered\ninto the village yesterday.  Apparently they\nbelieve that Kayla brought you here to save them.  Maybe she did.  Tonquin, we will send\neducational supplies, medical supplies. We will do everything in\nour power to help you. OK? Right now we need to get\nthat elephant on the road. We've only got till\ntomorrow afternoon to get back to the palace.  No.  Um, no?  Why?  She came to us. We cannot turn her away.  Yes, but the king\nbelieves that your people stole the elephant.  We have been blamed\nfor many things. They say this\nsteal, we disloyal. One month ago a factory burned. Many of our people die. We kill our own? Why? They blame us so no\none will listen to us. Kayla is the first\nsign of fortune.  But if we don't return her. King Saryu will\nsend in the army. And there's a young boy\nwho'll be punished as well.  Then you can compete for her. If Kayla's luck is with\nyou, you can take her. If not, she will stay here.  I'm sorry, uh,\ncompete for her? How?  They're saying this\nfellow is their strongest warrior, Your Majesty.  Eddie.  Paige, it's all right. If I win, we get the\nelephant and we can go.  Yeah, but you\nstill have to win.  Thanks, Soren.  That's all right.  This is a bad idea.  Bring it on.  [non-english speech] [chatter]  I should be able\nto handle him. [exertion sounds] Or maybe not.  This seems ill advised. - There has to be another way.\n- No, it's fine. Do you trust me?\n- Yeah, of course I do.  Wish me luck. Right. [laughing] [exertion sounds] [cheering] [applause]  Are you still conscious, sir? [applause] I don't believe\nI can watch this.  He doesn't know how\nto use that thing.  I don't suppose they'd like\nto have a fencing contest.  Rayen, can I\nborrow your machete? [thudding] [groaning] En garde, Your Majesty.  Ah! [crowd oohing] Ah! Ah! [laughing] [exertion sounds] [non-english speech] [applause]  Well?  You have proven\nyourself worthy. You may take the elephant.  Right, let's get out of here.  No.  No?  After the feast.  Feast?  Feast. A feast.  It is tradition, Your Majesty. You are now their\ngreatest warrior. And they will\ncelebrate with a feast.  Oh, a feast. Thank you, but we have to go.  She looks a bit grumpy.  Your Majesty,\nit might be best.  OK, we'll have a feast. [cheering] [music playing]  Well, I've lost my appetite.  What are those?  It's fly.  I don't know their\nname in English, but they are very rare.  Thank god. Oh, um, thank you, but--  They are honoring you\nwith this special delicacy.  You want ketchup?  Sir, seriously, don't.  A little crunchy. A little crunchy. [music playing] [chanting] [rhythmic clapping]  We are going to help\nthese people, aren't we?  Yes, of course, we are. [applause]  King Edvard, I\njust wanted to say, you fought extremely\nwell this afternoon. I was impressed.  Really? Oh, thank you, Rayen. That's quite a compliment\ncoming from you. Ladies will you,\nexcuse me for a moment. There's just someone\nI need to see.  He's quite a man.  Yes.  I'm jealous of what you share.  Yes. I'm very lucky that he's mine.  I think when you find\nsomeone you care about, you shouldn't let them\nget away no matter what the obstacles might be. I should go. Good evening, Your Majesty.  I just don't think\nanyone should know.  But I want to tell the world.  Kiss me.  What is going on?  Soren.  Your Majesty.  Oh, you're-- I'm sorry for interrupting.  Oh, you're-- you're-- you're\nnot interrupting anything. We were just, uh-- we were just, um-- discussing the best\nway back to the palace.  You were talking\nabout Soren just now.  And then you see Rayen slipped\nand her mouth fell on mine.  I see. I like this so much. Oh, no, no, no,\nno, it's just one of those kind of crazy\naccidents, a million to one really.  He's a lucky man.  So you see, we're just--\nwe're just good friends. - Right.\n- Totally Platonic.  Uh-huh.  I think she bought it.  This is Mr. Coin. See? OK. And Mr. Coin likes to dance. I'm just gonna take\nmy wedding ring off. Don't tell Paige. There he is. Right, ready? Doop ah doop ah\ndoo, ba doop a doo. Mr. Coin, Mr. Coin,\nhe loves to disappear. Watch him. Ready. Where is it?\nWhere is it? Is it there? Is it there? Is it? Should we have a look? Not there. [laughing] It was behind your ear. What's it doing there? What's it doing there? You've got a coin there. Do you always keep coins\nbehind your ear, do you? Do you?\nOK. And ready up here, look\nup here, look up here. Look up here. Ready, look. [laughs] You're gonna be outside and\nrunning around soon, OK? I promise. Hello.  Hi. What were you doing in there?  I just wanted them to\nhave some fun tonight too. You OK?  Mm-hm. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.  What for?  For being jealous and silly.  You are silly, yeah. Paige, there's no one else. There will never be anyone else. Do you know why?  Why?  No room. I love you. [suspenseful music playing]  What are you doing here?  Sir. I'm afraid I've\nfailed my mission.  [groans]  Sir. Sir. [non-english speech]  It'll be OK.  So unforgettable.  Goodbye. Thank you.  Bye-bye. [chatter]  Bye-bye!  Bye!  Your Majesty, the Red Ming are\nplanning to attack the palace.  What?  Yes, I overheard from\na worker in the field. They're planning to\ndisrupt the wedding just like they did the ceremony.  Why are my people so angry? What makes them want to\nhurt the royal family?  Who could say? But we must foil their plans.  How?  Move up the\nwedding, Your Majesty.  But I've told the\nDanish king and queen that they haven't until\nsunset to bring Kayla back.  This is not their kingdom,\nthis is not their problem. We must handle\nthis, Your Majesty. How quickly can we\nmove up the ceremony?  We're making good time.  Mm, thanks to Tonquin\nwe should be at the palace by early afternoon.  Your Majesties, we need\nto stop for some water. There's a river near by.  Right.  Your Majesty.  Rayen, what on earth is that?  That is where\nthe villagers work. One of Kah Rado's factories.  What?  A terrible place. He forces them to work 15 hours\na day, children, the elderly. There are no exceptions.  Eddie, look. That's what's making\nthe villagers sick.  This is horrible.  Soren, don't!  Don't drink the water. Nobody drink the water. [non-english speech]  I finally understand\nwhy Kah is so anxious to demonize the Red Ming.  Sir!  Soldiers.  Kah.  King Edvard.  Are you all right?  We're fine. Thanks.  We've been searching\nfor you everywhere. Danish army has been called in.  Well, you can call\nthem off now, thank you. We just need to get back to\nthe palace before the wedding.  That could be a problem, sir.  What?  The king has moved\nup the wedding.  Princess Myra, do you\nenter into the sacred bond, not only for yourself, but\nfor the kingdom of Sangyoon? Myra?  Oh, father, if only we could\nwait a little bit longer. I'm sure they will\narrive with Kayla.  If we wait any longer, the Red\nMing could spring their attack.  Myra.  Father, please.  My dear, Kah is a good man. He will take care of\nyou and our kingdom. We must think of\nthe greater good. Sometimes sacrifices\nare necessary.  I'm sorry, father. You're right. The kingdom is more\nimportant than my happiness.  Princess Myra, before all\nthese people and before God, do you enter into\nthe sacred bond not only for yourself, but\nfor the kingdom of Sangyoon? You must say I do.  I-- [elephant trumpeting] [horn honking] [elephant trumpeting] [chatter] [honking]  Stop! Myra, are we too late?  No, Queen Paige, you did it. I knew you would.  Good girl. Where have you been? The king and queen of Denmark\nhave returned our Kayla. The marriage and our kingdom\nwill have her blessing. [cheering]  Your Majesty, I\nneed to speak to you about your daughter's fiance.  Don't listen to\nhim, Your Majesty.  Excuse me, King Edvard has\nearned the right to speak.  Sir, this man is exploiting\nthe people of the north. Amongst many things, we have\nreason to believe he is dumping poison in their water supply.  Absurd. Those people are all\nthieves and liars.  You're the one\nlying about them so no one will believe them.  Our policies are\nnone of your business.  Is that why you sent\nthe army after us? Because we were interfering\nin your business?  The army?  It's true, Your Majesty. Sangyooni soldiers\ncame after us, attacked us, and then tried\nto kidnap Queen Paige.  I don't know what\nyou're talking about.  You told me to\nmove up the wedding. You told me the Red Ming\nwere planning an attack.  Your Majesty, if your intent\nin marrying your daughter to this man was to\nstrengthen your country, I must say, at least as far\nas Denmark is concerned, it will have the\nopposite effect.  We don't need\nDenmark or this king. This is our kingdom. The Red Ming are\npeasants made to work. Their sacrifice\nwill be the basis of our brand new world economy.  What have I done? How could I not see\nthe cruelty in you?  I'm sorry, Myra. There will be no wedding.  What? You are a fool if\nyou think you're calling off this wedding. I'll ruin you. I'll use every connection I\nhave to bring down this kingdom. And as for you.  You punched me in my nose.  Yes, I did.  Take him away.  Nice punch, Your Majesty.  Really?\nYou think so?  Absolutely.  Thanks. It was my first.  Get your hands off me. I'm calling my lawyer.  Your majesties, please\naccept my apologies. If there's anything I\ncan do to make amends.  There is, Your Majesty. You can release Alu\nand you can accept our aid for the Red Ming.  Of course. [applause]  And.  Yes, my queen. Your Majesty, Alu loves your\ndaughter and she loves him. I know you're worried about who\nwill lead your kingdom someday, but your daughter is a\nsmart and capable woman. You should trust her\njudgment and her choice.  But what does a\nsimple boy like Alu know about being a king?  I was just a farm girl when\nI became the queen of Denmark. [elephant trumpeting]  The course of true love\nnever did run smooth. The couple standing\nbefore me have loved one another, despite many\nforces trying to keep them apart, including me. But I was wrong,\nand they were right. Let this be not only a union\nof my daughter and her love, but of the kingdom of Sangyoon. We are not divided\nnorth and south. From this day\nforward, we are one. Alu, do you enter\ninto the sacred bond, not only for yourself, but\nfor the kingdom of Sangyoon?  I do with all my heart.  And Myra, do you enter\ninto the sacred bond not only for yourself, but\nfor the kingdom of Sangyoon?  I do with all my heart. [music playing]  Alu, son, you\nmay kiss the bride. I now have the great\nhonor of introducing to you the future king\nand queen of Sangyoon. [applause] [drums playing]  Well, I think that was\na rather than lovely way to celebrate our first year\nanniversary, don't you think?  I suppose.  What? Well, come on, it\nhad everything-- adventure, exotic locations,\nstar-crossed lovers, an elephant.  OK, you win.  Thank you.  It was amazing. But you really set the bar high\nfor our two-year anniversary. [applause]  Your majesties. Hello?  Yes, yes, um-- well, I-- I-- I-- I-- I-- well, I-- I-- I'm just, I-- well, I-- I-- I-- I'm gonna be--  He's taking a vacation.  I thought I might cash in\na few vacation days, yes.  I think that's great, Soren. You deserved it.  Any particular reason?  I make her laugh.  Oh!  Soren, you caught\nthe bridal wreath.  So I did.  Could you play,\n\"Someone I Can Love.\" [music playing] [cheering] [MUSIC - JOHN DANG, \"SOMEONE I\n CAN LOVE\"] (SINGING) An ordinary princess,\nroyal kind of highness, a lonely hearted Juliet.

[music playing]", "4VJfcD2XHls": "hey this is Ellen O'Malley with bass club Chicago and today we're talking 112 cabinets you can see we've got a variety of 112 cabinets here one 12s are becoming a very popular cabinet choice for gigging bassists they split the difference frequency wise between the traditional 115 or 210 cabinet they retain the sort of punch in the ridge clarity of a 10-inch speaker while extending the frequency range into the lower frequencies they don't get quite as sort of Whoopie as a 115 Ken they still retain a lot more definition and they're also generally a more compact speaker so if you're doing smaller gigs or if you're travelling around to a variety of gigs it's much easier to port on 110 then our sorry 112 it is a 115 or a 210 behind me here or to the side of me here I've got our three most popular 112 cabinet options we've got the DNS 112 from DNA didn't know chat audio we have the DB 112 from aguilar and the HD 112 from bergen Tina all three of these cabinets have their own different strengths they're all 8 ohm cabinets they all have relatively similar power handling the DNA handles 450 watts aguilar handles 3 Gino handles 350 they all have tweeters with tweeter controls they all have internal crossovers but they all do sound different and the cabinet you choose and you base a lot on you know your tonal preferences and your playing style so the DB 112 down here in HD 112 right here are more similar to each other than they are the DNA over there the DNA is a neodymium speaker and it's built into a plywood enclosure and it's a little lighter weight it's about 36 pounds the these guys over here are both ceramic magnets they're both built into 100% Baltic birch enclosures they're both about 45 pounds the DB 112 has an eminence custom made eminence woofer with a fifty six counts of magnet and the Burgin Tina the HD 112 has a proprietary burgandy no driver with an 18-ounce magnet so let's play through these three cabinets so you can get an idea of their evasive total characters it's now they differ from each other I'm going to play the same three risks through each of the three different cabinets using the same head and a nagrel'a so obviously tone is a very subjective thing our take on the characteristics of these through cabinets is the DNA the David nor shall over here DNS 112 is probably the most balanced speaker of all three of them just kind of across the frequency spectrum that's clarity presence it's well suited to a very wide variety of genres and playing styles the DB 112 from Aguilar it's a little bit more of a vintage sounding cabinets got real presence and punch in the lower mids there so if that's going to be tone you're going for then the DB 112 is a good choice and then the bergen - you know HT HD 112 up here just delivers a surprising amount of low-end for a speaker of its size a lot of that has to do with the huge magnet that's in that voice coil video 80s magnet so if you're into something you know if you need just a lot of base presence you just playing some some heavy rock and roll then the HD 112 and buratino is the way speaker all three of them are great speakers so if you've got any questions about any of these fingers or any of the products you see on the bass club site don't hesitate to email us or give us a call we'll be happy to answer questions thanks you", "P_9WQmicyJU": "great techniques gun handling techniques\ngun setup air hose handling sequencing a paint job and we're also going to be\ntalking about a whole lot of other things like airline systems the\nimportance of filtration the importance of air volume rather than air pressure so the other cool thing is that below\nthis you're going to see icons pop up talking about some of the equipment and\ntools that i'm going to be holding up there all available from eastwood and\nsome of them are on sale you can find all of this stuff at East\nwas so I just want to let you know that in advance the other cool thing is that you can\nactually feel questions you can you can talk to us and at the end of this\npresentation we're going to answer a few of those questions that you guys have a\nswitch is one of the beautiful things about what we're doing we are alive it's like it's like a news report we're\nlive here and it's very cool to be a part of this if you don't know who the heck i am i'm\nkevin taste I I own and operate and produce the patron location series also\ndo some TV shows i do the truck show on spike and I just want to say out loud I'm a really good painter now that might\nsound almost full of stuff like that but there's a reason that i can say that I'm\na really good painter is because I've painted thousands of cars it's not because i have God's gift of\npainting you guys anybody can be a really good painter it's repetition it's conscious thinking it's muscle\nmemory and that's what it is you gotta pay attention to the rules get your\nsetup right and do it over and over and over and over and over and over and over\nagain to practice practice practice practice practice and you guys if you're\na beginner if you're a pro you get better it's\nmuscle memory so when I say I'm a really good painters because I've done it a lot\nso all you gotta do to get your skills up is just practice so let's get started we're going to talk\nover here a little bit about air compressors now the air compressor is the heart of\nyour shop I'll say it again air compressor is the harder shop\neverything else depends one hundred percent on the quality and\nthe volume of air that you're putting out here's some requirements i hope you've\ngot a notepad if you don't these presentations are available for download\nlater you can view them later on and you can take some notes because there's a\nlot of important thing there's a minimum that you need to paint\na whole cart you need at least a five horsepower compressor a two-stage air\ncompressor preferably with a cast iron pump a minimum of a 60-gallon tank and\nyou're talking about spending some money you have to have the proper amount of\nair volume air pressure doesn't matter in painting any more air pressure is for\nyour tires it's a totally different set of\nequipment and set of systems air volume CFM is key and when you read the guns\nwhat they are required to have it CFM it's not pressured about 12 to 13 cm\nsome of the lower drawing some of these two guns are drawing less but he hears\nthe difference you can have you see the difference in\nthe inside diameter of this and this pipe ok you can have the same air pressure or\nthe same volume air pressure in both of these pipes and the volume that's coming\nout the end of this one is much greater than the volume that's coming out the\nend of this one so the volume is what atomizes and\nbreaks up the paint so you can breathe through a straw or you can breathe\nthrough a culvert pipe breathing through a culvert pipe is easier and it's easier\nto paint so think of that analogy when you're setting up your system so\nnow that you've got your air compressor I wanted to show you something else this\nis what I'm plumbing my main paint shop with its it's a\nsystem that i got from eastwood is three-quarter inch inside diameter\nairline and the fittings are really cool there are push lock style fitting that\nhas an o-ring system and a feral that compresses on top and it makes it makes\nshort work and make sure your airline routing very very easy and the system\nthat I've got has a hundred feet of the Blue Hose it's got several fittings\nseveral junction several unions and the cool thing is that it's flexible so you\ncan bypass a lot of the need for four look what you can do with it and it's\nlightweight aluminum with with a nylon membrane and it's really versatile so i\nhighly recommend that that again it also is available these wood let's talk about filtration you've got\nto have clean air got to have lots of air but you've got to have clean air so this is the little ball filter that\nyou you can buy and these you can screw onto the end of the paint gun and this\nwill filter somewhat of the debris is i don't recommend just this this helps if\nyou've got a problem sometimes this can solve it on the fly don't depend on this - to save your\npaint job this is called a desiccant snake it's filled with desiccant now we're\ngoing to explain this again in just a second so hang on this goes in line to your air system and\nit's got a silica inside it that will absorb moisture it doesn't compress it\ndoesn't interfere with your CFM delivery so this is a nice fix if you're doing a\nlimited amount of painting and I it this relatively inexpensive when they\nwear out you replace them then you get into your different regulators and\nfilters this is just a regulator with a gauge on\nit with no filter whatsoever this has got a filter you can mount a\ngauge and mounted in line with the regulator you've got to have a regulator\nto get your air pressure where you want it this is the mack daddy of all of it this\nis a three states a multi-stage desiccant system now desiccant is this stuff these\naren't silicon under silica what's silica beads that absorb moisture and it\nworks exceedingly well these packets or what you get with modern electronics\nwhen you buy a TV when you buy a computer they're all packed everybody's seen\nthese they come flying out of the box you throw in the trash they are the same thing is in this and\nthey'll be in your canister in line in your air supply and they will filter out\nthe moisture this is multi stage these two are\ndesigned to catch particular this is designed to catch moisture and you again you've got to have clean air you got to\nhave lots of air but you've got to have cleaner so think about systems like this now i want to make something very very\nclear if you buy this stuff and you don't install it correctly you are\nwasting your money so if you're not going to install it\ncorrectly don't don't even bother you just you\nknow throw caution to the wind here's what i'm talking about what\nhappens when air compresses it's a piston just like an engineered\nsuper heats that air when it comes off the manifold it's hot so if you put your expensive\nrelatively desiccant system right on the manifold or a couple of feet off the\nmanifold that air is still packed with moisture and it goes right over top of\nthe filters it doesn't get separated so what you\nhave to do is sit this at least 20 feet preferably 50 feet away from that hot\nmanifold of your air compressor and you might be saved yourself i'm in a one big garage i want to\nplummet i'm in a small shop I don't have 50 feet i've only got 30 foot walls here's something now don't plum with PVC\ni want to say that out loud right off the bat this is PVC and i made\nthis piece just for demonstration purposes so what you can do to cheat distance is\ngo up and down and up and down now this is 10 inches here this is 20\nfeet of three-quarter-inch ID piping so if I was to double this I've got 40\nfeet of of drying air of giving my air the the capacity to separate from the\nmoisture with this and it also gives you the opportunity to mount a ball valve\nbridge drain valve down here and get the water\nout and be able to evacuate so it doesn't fill up with water so thank your\nway through this stuff you can cheat distance with something like this plump it up and down you don't have to\nhave a 50-foot wall so keep that in mind when you're planning your airline system let's get to the good stuff let's start\ntalking about spray guns before we go into demos on the guns one of the questions that keeps coming\nup and and we've talked about this with the east with guys before we planned\nthis this presentation is gun settings air pressure settings yes you have to\nhave up you have to have the pressure set right\nand the gun recommends 10 pounds of the air cap it almost makes me angry that the gun\nmanufacturers say 10 pounds of the air cap because for you and I there's no way\nto verify that it's 10 pounds at the cap is not a gauge on the gun and there's\nnot a gauge of fits on the inlet to gauge the air pressure at the cap what you have to do is factor in the air\ninlet pressure right here now ten pounds at the cap a rule of thumb is that is\ngoing to give you between 30 and 34 pounds at the inlet so when they say ten pounds at the air\ncap just don't even worry about that worried about the inlet air pressure\nwhich is the pressure coming in to the base of your gun now here's the thing to people say well\nI set my air pressure but when I pulled the trigger is it goes all screwy well\nwhen you set your air pressure make sure your triggers fully depressed\nand whether you got a wall regulator or a regulator on your gun pull your trigger let air going through\nit is pressure is set with the device completely open so keep that in mind as\nwell now what am i doing with these things\ntaped to my paint guns extended stupid but there's a method to the madness here these are what I call dry training\nguides and they're perfect for for learning gun handling techniques like I\nsaid right off the head it's muscle memory its repetition and these give you\nthe opportunity to to understand what it feels like to be in the awkward strange\npositions without even having a single bit of fluid go through your paint gun let me show you what I'm talking about\nnow the bristles the bristles of this brush represent where I want my spray\ngun on the surface and this right here this is a Ferrari just in case you were wondering now what I'm doing is I'm\npracticing my technique by keeping the bristles just barely touching the\nsurface and I can practice my overlap and I can practice moving i can do a\nrehearsal on the panel to see if I'm gonna run over it but the most important\nthing is that up here in my wrist I'm getting a feel for how it feels when\ni'm in in the right position in a nice comfort zone using correct technique my wrist is well i'm going to overhear\nmy wrist is broken it's not like that i'm not sweeping I'm\ngoing in a linear format and my wrist break so that the brush on the end of\nthe spray gun is a beautiful training tool and it's surprising how effective\nit is for you to it really sets the light bulb off to know exactly where\nyour surfaces in relationship to your spray gun takes a lot of the pressure\noff another great idea is this guy right here the reason is sometimes it's easy to get\nlazy with our spray technique now when i'm lazy my spray pattern is\nlike this when I'm just kind of pointing at the panel with the gun and my pattern\nobviously is going to get really heavy down at the bottom and really light at\nthe top and it's going to tiger stripe it's going to be inconsistent it's not\ngoing to be what I want and this gives me the ability to test myself and keep\nmy gun perpendicular to the surface 90 degrees spray pattern parallel to the\nsurface so again it's a dry training guide that\nshows me if I'm off-kilter one way or the other and lets me memorize this\nnatural position that i'm going to have the best painting results so keep that in mind when you're\nspraying paint rehearse Ron covell talks about being excuse me\nwhen he's welding he does rehearsal to get is his comfort zone to get his is\nmuscle memory built up before he starts painting and before he starts welding\nand painting is absolutely no different you want to be in a comfort zone what\nI'm talking about the comfort zone is I don't want to be out here going crazy painting out here and and I don't want\nto go over here like this I want to have his own to where I'm in control painting is all about control your\ncontrolling your air your gun your fluid and your surface so if I'm out here if I'm out of control I take a step get in the comfort zone so\nkeep that in mind as well now i'm following an outline because we want to\nmake sure you have time for your questions so I'm gonna be looking at\nthis from time to time ok so we've talked about spray gun\ntechnique let's talk about air hose technique and\nwhy is that important I'll show you another thing to consider as well as\nyour CFM on your air compressor is CFM in your air hose I don't recommend anything longer than a\n25-foot air hose because you you you experience pressure drop over distance the other thing that's very very\nimportant is to keep a 38 inside diameter airline and three eighths ID\nfittings which these are not these are five sixteenths they're not three\neighths the difference between this and the professional spray gun setup that\nI've got in my booth is night and day I have seen an itch difference in this in\nthe length of the spray pattern by going to three eighths ID fittings very very\nimportant for a good effect of a good effect of spray delivery so what I'm talking about with the air\nhose this is nobody's going to do this really\nunless you forget when I'm over here guess what my air hose is do it it's\ntouching the panel and at the very least i'm not going to bunch of trash into\nwhat I'm about to paint or worst case scenario i'm dragging my air hose into\nwet paint not good so this is what i recommend\ntake your air hose clip it over the shoulder that's not good enough because look what\nhappens it can call off the shoulder guide it with your other hand and you're\nusing kind of a push poll you're controlling your environment there goes my guys and\nas I'm you see what I'm doing as i'm increasing my distance away from my body I'm feeding the air host when I come\nback I'm pulling it back take a little while to get that memorized but it's\nvery important to do so just think your way through this stuff in a rocket\nscience but it takes some thought and it takes some repetition we're going to put this over here let's talk about gun setup now that we\nknow what we're gonna paint we know what we're gonna paint with and\nby the way this is this is the the concourse gone from us what is a very\nnice piece of gear of the evolution guns or what you just saw they're very cost effective and they're\nnice guns i use these guns on jaded when I shot it and I'm very happy with the\nresults sometimes even the best spray guns can\nget a goofy pattern just due to maintenance and stuff collecting into\nthe air horns and things like that so right here this is a representation this\nis an elliptical pattern this is what you want to see this is\nlike a football shape and that's what you want to see out of your spray gun now if it's like this if it's heavy on\neach side and light in the middle that means you're blowing it out with\nair pressure your cranked up too high some of the spray guns only want 20\npounds at the inlet 20 to 30 pounds is typical so you have the opportunity to test on\nsome sort of a take-off part or a piece of cardboard like this set your spray gun before you paint your\ncar just like you're welding well on a piece of scrap before you you\nput your quarter panel in so this one right here this means it's\nheavy on one side having on the other side but it's it's cyclical it's it's\nit's a curved like that typically what that means is that one of\nthe air horns is blocked these are the air horns on the spray gun\ntip now one of those might be crusted up and blocked so you know it's a simple\nmatter of cleaning it but that's what that will tell you so see now check this out - this is the\ndigital air pressure gauge this thing's Nate if you got to have a\npressure gauge on the end of your gun this allows you to to adjust on the fly\nand it's very accurate so we're going to stick with a fairly\nlow pressure we're about 20 for the inlet so let's do it let's give it a shot so\nwhat do we got there we have the perfect elliptical pattern we've got the\nfootball right there buddy the reason we have that is because we're\nallowing the spray gun to do what is designed to do I've got the fan fully open I've got the\nfluid delivery fully open that's not to say you have to shoot like\nthat all the time but that's the optimal setup for me now we've got an air volume adjustment\ndown at the bottom of the gun body which is nice to have if you want to adjust on\nthe fly here if you're going into some some tight recesses it's nice to have that and here's your\nfluid delivery here's your fan that's a fan that's blue delivery so\nwatch what happens when I tweaked and i want to improvise is my pattern starts\ngoing away and what's going to have to you right there if it's going to run all over the place\nyou know we're not doing a collages or or art work we're painting cars and we\nwant a nice overlap so you can if you've got a cylinder to get inside it's really uncommon for me to recommend\nthat you choked your your fan pattern down and it's very uncommon for me to\nrecommend that you choked your fluid delivery down here's why see what I'm doing there it's misty what's going to happen is I'm\ngoing to get a rough surface i want a flat surface i want the pain to flow out\nand self level so I want to make sure that i'm letting the expensive spray gun\ndo it is designed to do now I know some of you guys are saying\nthis knucklehead is showing me how to spray paint that he doesn't have any\nsafety equipment on here I want to show you something this is acrylic craft paint I'm not\nbeing dangerous here there's no overspray in the air because this is a\nhigh quality HVLP gun it's not given me over spray and this is\nwater-based craft paint now when we do make some overspray of\ncourse i'm going to have a mask on so well I want to make sure that you\nunderstand that i'm doing this for demonstration purposes only and that\nit's a safe way to demonstrate these techniques to you guys so always always please keep safety in the forefront of\nyour mind these chemicals that were using when you comes time to paint are\ndangerous and their hazardous to handle as well as to ingest into our body so\nplease be careful and this is actually a good tip for you\nguys as well get some craft paint it's not that expensive it's certainly not as\nexpensive as automotive paint and it allows you to play around with your\nequipment and set things up and and get a feel for what you're doing so let's talk about let's talk about overlap what am I talking about with overlapping\nthat's a universal spray technique that you want a 50-percent overlap what am I talking about with that I've\nmade a pass there a 50-percent overlap means that i'm moving halfway down fifty\npercent from that pass and backtracking so this way fifty percent down overlap\nfifty percent down overlap fifty percent down overlap now i'm stopping and starting and you\ncan see what's happening as well you don't want to do that because you\nget a heavy build up on the edges I stopped and started so I could talk to\nyou guys and show you but you don't stop and start with your fluid delivery when\nyou're painting to ease the trigger off because you can keep the air going the\nsame time you're delivering you delivering paint so here's your technique it's not perfect it's the first coat is\nblack on the light substrate so that's what i'm talking about with overlap\nfifty percent overlap you want you want your vehicle to appear as though it's\nbeen dipped you don't want random dry spots and a 50-percent overlap or some\nkind of an overlap helps you build that code from one point to another point so\nvery very important to perfect your overlap and pay attention to what you're\ndoing and the gun handling techniques will allow you to be in a nice\ncomfortable position in your comfort zone while you're doing that speaking of\ncomfort your hand this is your guy this is what's what your eyes are telling to move through\nyour brain so here is your standard prone position for a spray gun if I want\nto pay up high like that on a van or something like that if I keep the same hand position it's\ngoofy I'm going to get a heavy pattern on one side so here's something that I've learned\nover the years you can change your hand position see how my wrist is broken there you can\nchange your hand position to to suit what you're trying to spray so I've just suggested my hand position\nand as I'm coming down I'm unlocking my wrist and now i'm in\nthe prone position the same thing goes for getting down a\nlittle bit lower now typically I get down on my knees I'm old I'm old as dirt\nmy knees hurt I don't want to get down on my knees in a concrete floor anymore that was in my twenties I'm not that\nanymore so what I've also learned how to do is adjust my spray gun and when I cup\nit like this but my palm over top of the controls now guess what I can do I'm down here\nand I've got a parallel pattern just like that perfect so if i don't want to get down\nlike this on my knees and getting my comfort zone I can make a quick adjustment of my hand\nand go from the prone position to this position here and have perfect technique\nso keep that in mind when you're moving around on a larger vehicle so we talked\nabout overlap we've talked about getting your gun set\nup properly we've talked about about proper\ntechniques handling your air hose here's something is very important I\nwant to talk to you guys about sequencing a paint job here's the analogy you want your car to\nappear as though it's been tipped as though you've grabbed the\ncovers and pull them up from your feet all the way up to your neck in one\ncontinuous coat sorry if that's goofy that's just what\nit made me think of but you have to sequence your paint job on a complete\noverall and this comes up an awful lot in in the website forms that i that i\nvisit the eastwood online restoration forum where do you stop where do you start let's talk about how\nto sequence a paint job but can do we decide to go over on that\nside are you okay there okay now keep in mind\nthis is my RC mustang it's clear and i'm going to be drawn all\nover it so obviously in this frame with you\ncan't move the car around but this this is what I'm talking about now I always start on the roof of the\nvehicle in an overall there's a couple of different reasons for that typically your air flow is coming from\nthe top down and creating an envelope around the vehicle even in a semi drown\nor a crop a cross craft paint booth the top surfaces are going to get hit\nfirst if I shoot the sides and then come up to do the top last I've got wet paint\nhere that i have the potential of messing up so when I start here and then\nwork my way around the vehicle and come up here by the time I get back to the second\ncoat on that top well it's probably drying up for me to stood to start again\nand I don't risk messing up my sides anymore so the sequence that I've\nlearned over the years i call now this is in the Patriot asian video series i\ngo into great detail in the videos to demonstrate this but i'm going to go\nahead and do it right here basically what I do is I start I like the driver's\nside I want to start on the driver's side and\nI do what's called a push-pull method I'm going to explain push-pull very\nclearly on a Ferrari right here so what I do is step number one I paint\nfrom the edge from the drip rail to the middle now a lot of guys start from the middle\nand work your way down I don't like it I don't like doing that because you get a\ndry spray in the middle and its tax the paint up so push we push to the middle now we\njump over to the other side and we start from the middle where it's still wet we grab that wet edge and drag it across\nthat step number two now I'm leapfrogging I'm leapfrog and that's\nwhat that means you're going from side to side to side to side to side and\nyou're creating a wet surface that grows through the car so step one step two I'm leapfrogging over back to the\ndriver's side quarter panel and I paint my quarter typically i like to start from the\nbottom and work my way up because that allows me to push across\nthe side so i'll come up over here right to the sail panel and then i'll eat proc\nover to the other quarter panel and i paid from the bottom up not riding on my\ndoor gap and i'll explain that in just a little bit and i paid my other quarter\npanel and because I've got a wedge here that i was just at now I can paint my\nway across that rear deck because I can reach it easily from the back bumper\nposition now I can catch up with my wedge now that I've got this I pick up the\ntail panel and I paint the tail panel now I'm leapfrogging back again over to\nhear my edge here is still wet enough to where I pick up the door and I sprained\nmy way up the door getting past my panel gap there's a\nreally good reason for that past my panel gap and it makes sense\njust to stop and start at the panel gap because it naturally breaks up the car however due to surface tension you're\ngoing to have a heavy build up on that gap if you're doing a metallic or a\ncandy it can really really bite you in the\nbuns and make sure that you see that transition you don't want that so I pet\nit past my panel gaps and I leapfrog over to the other side hope you're getting the picture and we\npaint our way up this door again again pastor panel gap so now what we've got is what's called\nthe doghouse it's the front end of the car this edge is still wet because i was\nover there less than a minute ago but it's dry enough now to pick up the wedge\nand I worked my way forward so I pick up the fender work my way\naround the wheel and I push my way across the the same way that I did on\nthe roof and this is the push-pull method you push to the middle and then\nyou pick up the middle on the other side you walk around pick it up and you pull\nit from the wedge and you keep it a continuous overlap all the way down\nuntil you've come all the way across the doghouse and this edge here is still wet\nenough that you can you can have this continuous coating and if you got a\nlower fascia grill pick up your dry edges there and you've\ngot one continuous code on that paint job that looks like it has no dry spots there's no transitions and\nyou know where to go and typically by the time you work your\nway around a car it takes 30 to 40 minutes to do a single code on a car\nwell there's your Flash time so - then you can go into the spray booth make sure got your cup again and start\nover start with your second coat or your third coat so that's how I like to sequence a paint\njob and here's another demonstration go back over this hot rod here and we do\nhave a little bit of time ok so I'm coming over here if I stop\nright here here's what that gap looks like that's\nlooking down at that door now my paint is going to bubble up here it's going to\nbe get really happy right there you've seen this on cars on original\nequipment cars so if you stop and start right here you're just accentuating that\nand you're building up crazy layers of paint right here right on that gap you\ndon't want to do that you want to the first coat maybe its prey up till here when you\ncome back around for your second code stretch it over to here on your third\ncoat back it off over here make sure you're getting three full coats change\nthe position of that that will really help you especially with translucent\ncolors or candies that is a that's a great technique if you're working a\ncandy walk beside that's a that's an advanced technique but this right here\nwill keep you from having runs in the gaps nobody likes the runs no different in\npainting yeah yeah", "lVRZhdusRVs": "sixth grade lesson 12.3 is dot plots and frequency tables we'll start with a dot plot a dot plot is simply a number line which uses dots to mark uh that show the frequency of data so the dots will show the frequency of how much something occurs let's have a look at one so i think you'll find that dot plots are a fairly simple idea and be comfortable with this right away let's have a look at how they unlock this problem hannah is training for a walkathon the table shows the number of miles she walks each day she has one day left in her training how many miles is she most likely to walk on the last day how many miles is she most likely to walk on the last day they say what do you need to find i'm just going to draw an arrow if you don't mind saying how many miles is she most likely to walk on the last day that's what we need to find so here's the data that we were given she she kept tracked every day of what she walked so these are all of her pieces of data you would first to make a dot plot you would first start by looking at the data pieces and find out what sort of range you're looking at as far as the lowest number and the highest number so you can build a number line that matches the data so if you look through here the lowest number looks like a one and the highest number looks like a nine so it looks like our numbers vary from one to nine so we can use the scale of zero to ten we could have used a scale of one to nine but we'll use zero to ten i tend to like to have 0 on my number line if i have big numbers like 60 or 70 i start counting by tens or something like that to um to account for that but i and when reads and able i like to have 0 on my number line so we need a scan a number line from 0 to 10 and then step 2 for each piece of data plot a dot above the number that corresponds to the number of miles hannah walked so they started this dot plot and they want us to complete it by plotting the rest of them for five through ten so the number of miles hannah walked most often will be the value with the tallest stack of dots the tallest stack in this dot plot is for we don't know yet right now we would say two and four are tied so they have already again they have already gone through and found the one they found all of the twos now generally when i do these i just go by the data i do the four dot done two dot done nine dot done and i cross them off as i go three they did that three they did that five five that was the one six two five two five four five four 9 3 2 and 4. okay there we are there's our dot plot the entire dot plot and the so it represents each dot represents one of the pieces of data here but now it's organized in a way that our brains can really see which one's happening more often when we were looking at it here it was hard to tell or all jumbled it's hard to see but now when you lay it out like this which one's happening more often most often she's walking five miles so um the tallest stack of the dot plot is for the five five miles we'll put the number of miles hannah walked most often is the value with the tallest stack of dots so the number of miles hannah is most likely to walk on the last day of her training is five make a note of this a dot plot is sometimes called a line plot so if you hear somebody say a line plot they really mean the same thing as a dot plot this makes sense as a name for it the dots represent the data dot plot explain why a dot plot is useful for solving the problems it when we were looking at it here the freak the data it was hard to tell which um piece of data showed up most frequent most often so this gave us the chance to see which came most often most frequent that was one of the vocabulary words they also started with in here frequency how often pieces of data show up and we learned we couldn't see it here but as soon as we lined it up with those dots we could see oh five is most frequent it shows up with the most frequency so we can say on this um it helps us see which data shows up with the most frequency i ran out of room i'll go sideways frequency there you go that is a dot plot dots that represent the data on a number line pretty easy right the next part of this lesson is frequency tables let's have a look at those so first we'll look at a frequency table a frequency table is simply a table that tells us how often that number shows up so another way the dot plot shows us how often it shows up this is another way that shows how often something shows up jill kept a record of her workout times how many of jill's workouts lasted exactly 90 minutes so she's got all of her workout times and then she creates a table of how frequently she does each of these things how frequently did she do 30 minutes how frequently did she do 60 minutes how frequently did she do 90 and how frequently did she do 120 and again i go through these by crossing them off as i go we went through the 30s first they found those fours there were seven one two three four five six seven let's go through and find how many sixties there were there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven there's a lot of those how many nineties are there one two three four just four and then how many 120 minute workouts one two three four five six it says record the frequency of each time in the frequency column we did that and we completed it so blank of jill's workouts lasted exactly 90 minutes 90 minutes four of jill's workouts that's how frequently 90 minutes showed up was four times that's a frequency table so we saw dot plots where you would represent them in dots and you would see the the tallest stack would be the most frequent um in this one this tells you how frequent the amount is in numbers rather than dots right the most frequent being the 60 minute workouts but you can just count them and then finally they teach us about a relative frequency table relative meaning basically that it's going to be in a percent so we do need to dust off a little bit of cobwebs on finding percents and what percents are so remember percents are out of a hundred so for every 100 how many represent whatever you're asking about and it that really we use percents a lot because it evens things out it helps us understand um the relationship between that item and a hundred total so you can use pie charts to to represent it it just makes it easier for our brains to digest so to to refresh your memory on how to find a percent the way you would do it is you would start with step one the ratio the ratio of what you're seeking the information you're wondering about and the total amount of data that is there and remember ratios can are simply a division problem this divided by that and if you're using using our standard algorithm for division this number since it's out in the rain right now gets to go in the house it goes inside of that box that we use for our standard division algorithm and this one since it's protected from the rain right now it's his turn to go out in the rain if that helps you at all so let's go ahead and see this happens they did these for us but i'm going to walk you through them um to help you make sense of it let's start the beginning the table shows the number of laps ricardo swam each day what percent of the days did ricardo swim 18 or more laps so this says how many laps he did that's the frequency just like we did the frequency table so we would first go through and count them all up and do the frequency they did that for us thank you very much we don't need to go crossing off and doing it they did the frequency for us there's a total of five columns and four rows that means there's a total of 20 possibilities remember the total is that part of the ratio so how often percentage-wise what's the relative frequency was the percent that he did three to seven laps well the frequency showed up the amount we seek is four out of twenty possible to find that percent i do the division 4 divided by 20. and of course you're going to find these are going to be proper fractions if it's a proper fraction you right away are going to know um it doesn't it doesn't go miss sanchez 20 does not go into four so we're going to give it a decimal float that decimal up give that a lifesaver like you're saving somebody's life the four is there drowning in the water throw that little round lifesaver to it 20 goes into 40 twice okay and i end up with 0.2 also known as 0.20 we can put that 0 on there we're going to need that here's why the second part of changing information into a percent is that we need to multiply it by 100 because we're dealing with percent out of 100 which really just means i'm moving the decimal two times that way multiplying by 100 just moves my decimal two times that way one two twenty percent that's how they got that and they did this here 4 out of 20. that's what we did then they ended up with 0.2 like we did move the decimal twice 20 let's see it again on this one this one is 6 out of 20. that is um 6 divided by 20 it doesn't go right because it's a proper fraction decimal life saver 20 goes into 60 three times for 60 20 times 3 is 60 that is 0.3 or just 0.3 move the decimal twice oops i need to add a spot go ahead and add that 0 for a spot and there i end up with 30 they did this this way 6 over 20 which we did they didn't show the division algorithm on how we got that so i wanted to show that to you they got 0.3 like we did move the decimal twice to make it the percent because you're multiplying by 100 because it's out of 100 that we're talking about for per cent per is out of cent like century and since 100 cents in a dollar sent us out of a hundred okay let's try this one i'm going to change my colors of my pen here all right we have a 7 is the frequency out of 20. 7 out of 20 times the ricardo did 13 to 17 laps so we go seven he goes in the house because he's been in the rain and 20 goes outside in the rain because he has been inside doesn't go in decimal lifesaver to save it 20 goes into 73 times i get 10 left over throw a lifesaver down to that 10 save them from drowning 20 goes into 100 five times you get 100 done move the decimal twice 35 that all coming back to you on how to do percents hopefully i mean some of you maybe already had it solid in your brains but some probably needed the review it's pretty normal to need that review final one uh eight he did 18 to 22 laps 3 out of 20 times let's write the ratio 3 out of 20 times let's do the division 3 goes in the house 20 is outside the house obviously that won't go in decimal lifesaver 20 into 30 goes only once 1 times 20 is 20. i get 10 left over throw that 10 a lifesaver save him from drowning 20 goes into 100 five times move my decimal twice let me change that color 15 and now we have completed our relative frequency table meaning it's still the frequency but now we're finding the percents of time that that occurs divide each frequency by the total number of data values we did that look how pretty that is write the result as a percent in the relative frequency column we did that complete the relative frequency table we did so ricardo swam 18 or more laps on what percent of the days 18 or more laps on 15 of the days okay so we did dot plots you just put those data in each piece of data goes as a dot above the number line we learned about frequency tables that just takes the data and you just put it in a table just the number of times and then relative frequency table really just takes that and extends upon it by finding the percent what you seek over the total amount divide it for that ratio so you get that ratio you divide it like we did over here then you move the decimal twice over because you're multiplying by 100 and there's your percent hopefully you'll find a great success at this those were all we wanted to learn in this lesson i think you've got this", "JatjRH9o1Cw": "i started the recording most of these are out of 6.3 i can't remember what 6.3 is i think that's applications but 6.3 let me put them in order just in case and six point three fifteen slash seven six point three fifteen slash seven and since mine is acting quirky and nobody else wants to be on video i'm going to cut my video off too so that way i can be part of the weaned on a pickle crowd all right write the phase write the phrase okay what does it say decreased by x what i say about more than less than that's in other words decreased by you flip-flop 19 decreased i'm writing this on the sheet and then we'll work it decreased by x comma divided by divided by eleven well it looks like to me whenever i see decrease by a flip-flop decrease by less than and x is going to go right here and 19 is going to go right here and what does decrease by mean subtraction contraction and then divide that by 11. so it should be x minus 19 divided by 11. fraction fraction x minus 19 divided by 11 and we feel good about ourselves no that's i did the number first i don't know why that matters but okay i'm sorry i've led you wrong it's 19. okay i have i've i put that in with less than and greater than you can't do that i'm sorry decreased by x that's my mistake i read the question wrong decreased by x so it's that 19 my bad i messed up it's all good okay next well let me do another one just in case all right here's one so that would be 21 minus x divided by two minus x and the whole thing divided by two when you see it greater than or less than you have to go different but this is not depreciated by so that's 21 divided by x or minus x divided by two so 21 minus x divided by two okay um i'm allowed to get one or two wrong every now and then i'm human 6 3 23 10 15 less than here we go there's the less than right there so 15 i'll draw it on the white board 15 less than 4 times a number oh this one's mine yeah i got the equation but then i had problems solving it for some reason and this is 41. so the first thing you're going to do is draw a equal sign and 41 and that takes care of that okay and down here we're going to take that 15 and 4 times the number you're looking for is what 4x so 4x minus 15 is equal to 41. that is a test question it's also a standardized test question too so wait that's the answer i thought you had to like get x by itself as i tried to do now they say solve it i didn't i didn't look at the directions hold on so the solution is i don't okay yeah well there's the there's the equation and then solve it so take 15 across the river and 4x is equal to 56. that's how i got so far i'm sorry 56 yeah that's what i got divided by four and that's going to be like 14. that's what i got i put that in there i put x is equal to 14 and it said that was wrong well i don't know what it could be well let's check it 4 times 14 minus 15 is equal to 41. well what's 4 times 14 well 56 isn't it it marks it wrong because it doesn't want you to put the x equals it just wants a solution oh it doesn't want to okay that makes more sense okay so 41 is equal to 41. okay in a case like that on a test you know i would be but try to try to you know that's why you got three that's why you got three uh tries so x is equal to 14. so you know that's what they don't want they want you to just put 14 not the x equals that's what i did and that's why i kept marking it wrong now that is a test question okay so i did it right i just put that right on and put because i do ask some of those questions right there and standardized test also next one i know we're going to get to some good word problems because we always do 6 3 27 slash 11. a number increased by six is two less than twice the number okay i'm gonna write it down y'all be working on it a number increased by 6 is 2 less than twice the number all right give you a second or two to work on it now the main thing on this one is the word is which means equals yep and that's the main thing you need to worry about on this one that's what you should start this one with so let's take our handy dandy white board [Applause] first thing i'm going to do is draw an equal sign and that takes care of that is and then over here a number increased by six well with increase by you don't have to worry about the flip flop so what's a number if you don't know it x and over here so what's twice the number that you don't know two multiplied by x less than is minus two and there's your equation x plus 6 is equal to 2x minus 2. where is the number one step mistake students make on this one this right here they'll have 2 minus 2x or something like that and that's where they'll get it wrong which one's the smallest bucket x or 2x which for the smallest bucket thanks take it across the river take two across the river eight is equal to x and yes that is a test question did you get it wrong again because you put in it yeah it's the same thing yeah cuz i put the x in there that's all right we forgive you next six point three twenty seven slash eleven okay here we go now again a number increased by seven you don't have to worry about that one because increased addition is commutative so you don't have to worry about that one but the is a number increased by 7 is 4 less than twice the number okay so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to bring down that is that is is a good indicator and good place to start is means equals and this one really doesn't matter how you do it because multi addition and multiplication is commutative so it doesn't matter a number is x so x plus seven crisscross and i made a big deal about that when you see the words less than it's crisscross you remember me saying that last week yeah yep twice the number so x plus seven is equal to two x minus four bring the smaller bucket across the river bring the floor across the river x is equal to 11. and yes that's a test question this was like just like miss uh grendel's question those both are good test questions so that would be x plus seven is equal to two x minus four and the answer is eleven two good test questions 6.3 29 12. number increase same type question a number increase by 8 equals i'm gonna go ahead and just put an equal sign where that is two times the sum of the number and one and that's what it looks like so what is a number excuber that's right class thank you for interacting it's always nice to have a class to interact even though none of y'all do but we try hubert i know you try but there's only like two of y'all two or three y'all that says anything risky or weaned on a pickle and you're going to have an office at the old janitorial closet and they're going to put a piece of plywood over the sink and that's going to be your desk because you don't talk to anybody all right so that'd be x plus 8 is equal to well what does sum mean what does that mean uh addition subtraction location or division edition and we can show the whiteboard you can't see it and mine shows the classmates oh i'll turn off the presentation and turn it on again okay see if you see it now it should be coming up i can see it now you see it now yes sir thank you mrs goodman wow that was amazing miss goodman communicated and we got something done that communication it does wonders doesn't it i'm not picking on you miss goodman i appreciate you telling me thank you picking on the class all right so sum means plus so i'm gonna put a plus right here because i have no idea so that's so i'm gonna take my handy-dandy blue marker okay somebody else tell me what's going on on that right side well you got the number so it's x plus one x plus one good the number and one so that would be x plus one so i'm going to take that orange marker the number and one okay so i'll tell you a little trick times means multiplication all right so i've got to multiply x plus 1 by what two two there you go so now i want you to finish it i want y'all to distribute that too and finish it give you a minute you can't do it in a minute that means you suck and you are a failure that's 2x plus 2. it will be yes when you distribute it quit getting ahead of things miss grendel i apologize x plus eight is equal to y'all do realize that y'all are one of my favorite classes this semester out of the six y'all are the most interactive which really is sad okay because there's only two or three people in the class that speak so that tells you what my other classes are like yeah that's not good [Music] and which one's the little bucket the x let's cross the river and that 2 comes across the river so x is equal to what 6 and y'all can actually plug it back into the original equation six plus one is five two times five is what 10 and what's eight plus one minute that's not right six plus one is seven six plus one is seven seven times two is fourteen plus six times plus eight fourteen so fourteen is equal to fourteen so the answer is correct so we go back to the handy-dandy question and we type in x plus 8 is equal to 2 parentheses x plus 1. and the answer is six good test question next question 6.3 31-13 set up an equation that can be used to solve the problem solve the equation blah blah blah all right so here is when a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company drive to out of town's meeting that require an overnight stay they receive 160 dollars for lodging plus 0.75 per mile driving okay or driven how many miles did joe drive if his company reimbursed him 317.50 for an overnight trip this is technically the walmart equation okay so we're going to draw the walmart equation i'm going to draw it on hold on a second i'm going to draw it right here just so we can compare it x plus or minus percentage x is equal to the total okay now first of all where is is or where is something that says the total what what tells me the total the 317 is the 23 17.5 so the 317.5 is going to go over here and of course half the problem is done because you got half the equation figured out now what else let's see can anybody tell me if there's a percent in the problem the money .75 so .75 goes here and an x and an x now let's read the question on what they get they receive a hundred and sixty dollars plus so which one of these are we going to use plus or minus plus and what goes in the x position well hold on a second yeah this this x i mean the 760 goes right here because that's the original price so 160 plus 0.75 x is equal to 317.5 and x is miles okay now i told you is similar to the walmart equation i didn't say it was the walmart equation walmart equation the x is the same as this 160 but in this case it's 160 plus 0.75 per mile and they only given him 317.50 for this overnight trip so he's going to try to try to make get as much money as he save as much money as he can so he can buy himself a steak dinner and refreshments so 160 plus so that 160 is gonna go across the river 0.75 x is equal to let's take out our handy-dandy calculator unless your rainman you ain't gonna know how to do that so 317.5 minus 160 157.5 157.5 divide by 0.75 divide by 0.75 and x is equal bring out our calculator divided by 0.75 and i get 210 miles what'd y'all get sam that's because we are smart and we feel good about ourselves so 160 oops plus 0.75 x is equal to 317 point what five and 210 miles and yes that is a test question that's a standardized test question also why why would you think this would be on a standardized test not the pharmaceutical part why would this be on a standardized test i'm not sure because is this applicable to a job yeah it could be getting reimbursed for miles driven yes i get reimbursed when i drive my truck to a to a conference i get reimbursed they give me like 50 cent a mile which that's fine with me i mean that's no big deal for me but what i'm saying is they give me reimbursement next 6.3 38 16. uh set up an equation solve each year andrea donates a total of two thousand dollars for scholarships at her local community college this year she wants the amount she donates for liberal arts to be nine times the amount she donates for scholarships for business determine the amount she will donate for each type of scholarship all right first of all where is my equals and where is my total well the total is eight well for me it's eight hundred dollars for you it's two thousand okay yeah for this one is two thousand so equals two thousand and somebody tell me how many how many how many scholarships does she give to one or two or five what does it say arcs and what i'm showing you all this hold on so i've already got the equation set up arts plus business you know how i spell business in my head busyness b-u-s-i and then this you ever you ever notice how you pick up on some of those things you learn how to spell i spell wednesday wednesday but y'all don't do that do you mean won't tell me anyway wednesday because if you spelled wednesday like it's like it'd be wednesday wednesday wednesday that's the way you'd spell it but you can't spell it like that because that's not right so you have to spell it right with this day i see you busyness i learned that when i was little i would always want to put bus in ess so i started saying busyness and that's what i did back in third and fourth grade when i learned how to spell or in 12th grade i just wondered if any of y'all did that but you ain't gonna talk to me so moist how you spell moist y'all hate the word moist for some reason i don't know why don't bother me at all i don't understand that either i don't either i mean i as i asked the class what word do you hate i would say 50 of class would say moist and i don't know why all right total of 2 000 this year she wants the amount she donates for liberal arts to be nine times what she donates for business well business she just gives what x so what would arts be gmail what would arts be would it be 9x 9x good job oh nine times the amount okay we all are a winner so 10x is equal to 2000 and you do not need a calculator divide by 10 x is equal to what 200. so she gives 200 to the what to the business side and what does she give to the arts what's 2 times 9 1800 arts gets 1800. business gets 200 and arcs get 800. the equation is 10x is equal to 2 000. andrea will donate 200 to the business scholarships and 1800 to the liberal arts good test question at least y'all are sending good test questions i can't stand it like in math 120 there's a lot of questions in the homework they are terrible test questions 6.3 43-17 use proportion direct proportion to solve the following problem the water rate for a city in north carolina the water rate for a city in north carolina is 132 1.32 per 744 gallons so i got dollars on top and gas on the bottom or gallons sorry gallons i got dollars on top and gallons on bottom so over here i'm going to put dollars on top and what gallons on the bottom all right now let's read the rest of it it says how is the water bill if how what is the water but sorry what is the water bill if resident of that city uses 40 000 gallons so a is going to be 132 over 744 is equal to x dollars over forty thousand one forty thousand gallons hubert thank you class oh suck why are y'all being like this today monday i guess monday okay all right crisscross and that's going to be 1.32 times 40 000 divided by 744 now i did skip a step or two in there but you can say 132 times 40 000 equals x times 744 and to get the x by itself you're going to divide by 744 so i kind of skipped a step the only reason i skipped steps because i was running out of room okay so pull up our handy dandy calculator 132 1.32 times 40 000 divided by 1.32 i'm sorry 744 seventy point nine seven seventy dollars seventy one dollars pretty much 70.97 well that's right i guess because i don't see no red things so they must get that right if the water bill is not to exceed 130 dollars so b b 1.32 over 744 gallons equals a dollar amount here over gallons all right now what are we looking for go back to the question what are we looking for gallons of water so what do you put for gallons if you don't know it x and what's the only other number they give you 130 130 what dollars per hour so 130 goes right here cross multiply 1.32 times x is equal to 130 times 744 and divide by 1.32 x is equal to take our handy-dandy calculator out i'll make it a little bit smaller so that's going to be clear clear 130 times 744 divide by a dollar 32 cent 73 272 73 272.73 and they probably want you to round it up to gallons so let's look and see uh round to the nearest integer so that's the nearest whole number so i'm going to say x is equal to 73 273 gallons 73 273. so for 150 130 a month you would be using up to 73 000 gallons really that's not wrong i mean i don't know not gonna waste my time on it i didn't put a comma folks i'm sorry i suck do you know there's teachers that turn ask my instructor off why why are they teaching my question all right 6.3 6.3 43-7 i know i got i know i'm running out of time but i'm gonna do these last two problems okay we just did this one okay i'm sorry i need to delete that all right last one 6.3 43-17 okay that's the same question all right so we were able not to go into 6.4 but i don't think that hurts y'all's feelings so yeah i'll finish 6.1 through 6.3 and we'll go into 6.4 wednesday okay sounds good see y'all", "DM41x-dmoAQ": "hey y'all I hope that this little video finds y'all doing well and adapting to this new normal that we're living through and you know I promised y'all that I was gonna try to come up with recipes to share with y'all with things that I hope and think you might have in your pantry so I'm gonna share a recipe that I'm telling you from California to New Jersey people have given me feedback on this recipe and it's so simple and so easy it's almost embarrassing but people love it and that's the corn casserole I've got one in the oven that I'm waiting to finish because I'm gonna top it with cheese and this is embarrassingly simple but you don't love it I'm gonna use one can and this is 14 and 3/4 ounce I think you know 15 point 2 5 can of Niblick corn 14 point 75 can of creamed corn a jiffy mix 1 cup of sour cream 1 stick of melted butter and that's yet so here we go oh let me I'm gonna check on this one because when I take them in a little while ago they're still a little shaky in the center [Music] we show you how to do this it's jiggling just a little bit I don't too much one it did you okay so while we're waiting on that one we're gonna put this one together and I'm gonna start with our you don't if you don't have jiffy mix that's alright if you've got any kind of little sweets one bread mix you can substitute back but you know jiffy mix it's like it's almost like cake so that's why it's so good with the sweet only 50 Cent's so we get I was on hope you bought - yay Teresa all right in goes the creamed corn and goes to niblet and you want to drain that in goes ooh but it's good okay so I'm just gonna get this mixed up and then I'm gonna add my butter now I think the original recipe when stick of melted butter which the recipe cost by half a cup and one stick of butter equals 1/2 cup and I think the original recipe for this y'all I don't think it called for cheese on top I don't remember but I don't think it did but I have found that the cheese just makes it look okay now want that hard Joan scholar is tired from working all right I'm gonna spray this is so I can get it to come out and in the dish it goes every drunk Bobby uh you know what we actually serve this at the lady in sons now and we serve this it Poland anything the kitchen we don't just at the lady and sons and people love it a lot of people make sure that this is on their Thanksgiving table that's how good it is that easy yeah yes nope it's rigged so I tell you to generously top it with up cheese and I'm using just a sharp cheddar but you can use you know whatever your favorite cheesy little bit more or no cheese yeah you don't have to have cheese some people are actually allergic to Gary but no uneri I'm not sure they do with cheese a lady and sons do that uh uh um cuz the original recipe was down without all right so 40 to 45 minutes and I'm gonna have mo Cowan casserole to eat than a show dog ginger but we're in about 25 minutes so I'm gonna let that cheese melt and then I'm gonna show it to y'all and show you what it's supposed to look like you know my newest paula deen's southern bacon boom you know why I love that book so much because every recipe has a picture and tells people especially people that don't know how to cook absolutely you know they say a picture's worth a thousand words and that shows me what the goal is that's why I was asking about the jiggle because people don't know how well they should jiggle or not oh right right sometimes you don't want to jiggle sometimes you do like gooey butter cake she won't come the jingle a little bit all right let's look at that cheese not quite so I'd love to hear from y'all and see how y'all are keeping busy before the days over I'm really gonna try to get down on the floor and do some stretches and things like that if y'all would like to join me for that if you like watching a whale on dry land I am so stiff that Dancing with the Stars kill my knees y'all it told my meniscus in both knees oh but it was worth it it was worth it yes yes yes what a great experience incredible so how's that cheese it's pretty cheesy right now but you know what they say about watched pot never balls that is so true you stand there and watch that pot and that sucker wouldn't bond for nothing but you get a phone call and you get carried away not only does it ball it burns up but not let people know that we're answering questions that you answer questions forums only just submit them to Paula Deen calm or Paula Deen family kitchen knock did y'all hear Theresa we've started answering questions in fact and sat down yesterday and I took a handful of questions that y'all had sent me in and I sat down and answer them and most I may have an answer for work you do but not all do I have an answer for anyway so I so appreciate that so you can go to Paula Deen family kitchen and respond or you can go to Paula Deen calm or Facebook page or Facebook pages whatever all that stuff is above my paygrade y'all and trouble keeping it it straight in my mind but anyway I love that I love I feel like that blitz me even closer to y'all you know when we can have a conversation so if you got a question or maybe you have a recipe you want to share you know get in touch with me go into one of those pages and get in touch with me and I would be happy to share your favorite recipe with the world okay ah look at that don't get any better look at that you know what you need to set my little time because this one doesn't want a timer white that's like all right I'm only saying I'm about 40 minutes right now Oh let's get a spoon whoa maybe you know take blue spoon okay man well with social distancing Oh we're kind of trying to make sure we follow okay look at the H Oh you come around here idiot get that yeah can you get there I got beautiful that is oh great Grammys it's hard to believe that something that simple it could be that good you can almost serve it as a dessert sweet come one now gotta try this recipe and I hope you love it so y'all let me hear from you I'm trying to keep y'all occupied zone", "HDuuJvyiZiI": "hey guys we get a lot of questions at the website about what to do with the air pressure with your gun and what pressure should I be set at and what should I be spraying and how but a lot of times we find that it's not the pressure of the gun for what you're spraying a lot of times the pressure at the wall and the volume of the air that's available to the gun so we thought we'd take some time to talk about that Tony thanks for taking the time yeah no problem what we see many times out in the shops are especially where there may be painting out in an open shop or priming with a prep deck so they made us have a prep deck but not necessarily have a regulator there to control pressure or you go into paint booth and all they have is a fitting on the wall or they have a regulator that's pinned at 140 pounds and they're going to paint from that now of course on the spray guns we have either a digital gauge built in or you can run a regulator at the base of it but what happens when you do that when you restrict that down start turning that micrometer down it's just open closing the hole to be a pretty small hole and when you have to do that what ends up happening with that gun is when you make that hole smaller whether it's on a regulator or it's on the air micrometer itself the air speed to get the pressure that you need to the front of a gun just increases too much so now I have a huge velocity of air going through that small hole because this gun if it's an HVLP gun I need 15 CFM if it's an RP I need 10 CFM but to get that volume of air that I need to the front of the spray gun through a smaller hole the velocity has to go faster and when that speeds up it blows past the horns and it actually blows past the paint that's coming out of the fluid tip too quickly and if it's that velocity is going too fast your air cap does not have time to analyze it properly so our horns on this gun and our center of our air cap create what the fan shape is but if it's going too fast you may see little Bam's that you'll see coming off the edge of the fan when you're trying to spray a base coat with that you're transparent metallic you could see blotchiness or you could see little stripes that are forming in it if you're trying to spray a clear coat like that you could see where you're getting maybe a thin spot in the center of the fan or different areas are getting wetter or thinner and it affects your millage or you may have a dry to drive of condition so when it's very clear so what we always recommend is to leave your air micrometer as close to open as possible and just adjust that the wall you if you've got a regulator at the wall that you can control your pressure with I can set that pressure closer to what my operating pressure should be so if I need on a clear coat gun if I'm going to spray with this RP 4000 if I'm going to shoot clear coat eye with this gun I can spray the lure I might spread out 26 pounds but if I've got 70 coming to it and I cheat it down I'm going to have the problems we talked about but if I leave this open and instead of setting it at 26 that I'm going to spray with I leave it at 30 mm-hmm now I can adjust a little bit on that and that way as I'm painting down the side of a car if I do lose a little pressure I have a little room to open it up but I'm not closing off that air micrometer now I guess the better maybe give a little bit of an idea of what how that happens it's no different than if you were trying to with that small hole running through here if you were trying to breathe through that little coffee coffee sauron if you took that thing and try to breathe through that for four or five minutes you turn perfect this is next to impossible really hard on that to get to the air through it but if you take a milk straw or a shearing straw that you get you can breathe and it's absolutely easy to breathe and that's the same thing with a spray gun when we take these fittings when we use High Flow fittings it opens up so that air can travel through in a velocity or not with the low velocity but with a high volume if I use the smaller fittings and this is one of the better examples of a small fitting right there's also the Lincoln fittings that have the real long neck on them that are real thin that will literally slip inside of a high flow if I do that the problem we see is airspeed has to increase to go through this and so you can do everything right in your paint work and have a pore paint job maybe your clears not laying down well your base coats not laying down well simply because of the fittings you chose now we go backwards from that we can look through your whole system at airlines and different things if you've got restrictive fittings in an airline that can cause problems but for the most part at the shop put high flow fittings on to your spray gun adjust your pressure at the wall down to close to your operating pressure and then micro adjust with a or micrometer so with a little bit more we can show you how to air on a cutaway version what that air micrometer does that little air micrometer opens and closes this valve and when I when I open that Valve air comes into the handle and it blows up through the hole on the bottom of that air micrometer and then it goes through the spray gun when I pull the trigger it opens up this packing to slide back and it opens an air passage to the front of it done now on our digital gauges we also have a secondary air passage right here that allows that air pressure to go back down into the digital gauge so when I pull the trigger and it opens slides that 2:40 packing back it allows the air pressure the same air pressure that's going to the fogger gun is going to my gauge so I have an accurate reading but if I'm if I'm cheating this way down and you'll see here when I turn this sideways all of a sudden you can see that whole opening right and that's a perfect fitting for our straw example that we were given a while ago yeah but that now is turn sideways and now that's not aimed at the tube that through there done it's actually sideways and the gun is covering it so I'm only going to have a corner just a small portion of that hole open and so it restricts the air it has to go faster through the gun to get the volume that that gums needing and it causes the paint problems we talked about so it's really important to keep this as far they're as close to open as possible now in addition to the paint problems about you know bad lays of the base and the clear it can also cause some use issues with products as well if I'm overriding the horns I may be using too much too little product material affecting the profitability anyway well one of the other things that happens is in fine using too much air and it's over drying a base coat yeah of course it's going to lay down coarse lay down with texture clear coats the same way if I'm spraying that and I have too much pressure and it's over drying it many times you'll see where that now they're slowing down and flooding more clear on to let the product flow and I'm Way over using a material I need so I think the last thing coupled with having the air pressure set correctly many people think that they need to use you know we've always recommended on here on an HVLP spray gun like this one it says max pressure 29 pounds our RP it says max pressure 32 but what's the great thing about these new for thousands is we do not have to use that much air and in many cases it's detrimental we have to prove it that that pressure we get above the transfer efficiency required by South Coast Air Quality Management District and we meet all the guidelines for the EPA so that's why we set that high-pressure but we can use these guns if I'm spraying bass I'm going to shoot it with this 4,000 at maybe 25 psi to start with if I'm going to shoot clear with this gun I'm going to shoot with the RP at about 26 and that's about where I start when it gets hotter and you've got a real hot climate especially when we get into desert conditions where it's hot and dry I may turn that down to 24 pounds and my bass gone down to 24 23 psi so that it wets up but when you do that you also have to remember with these guns not to spray back at the 8 to 10 inches that maybe many people were taught years ago with this gun when I plugged that in to air I want to move that in till I hit a wall of air pressure so if I'll set this gun at 26 pounds pull the trigger over there and move in till I feel that wall you're going to notice it's right about that 5 15 5 and 6 inch range and that's the ideal spot to paint and where you feel that wall of pressure is where your atomization energy is the perfect area is on the front of this fluid tip we have a break plate it's a round disc and that round disc lets the air hit the backside of that round disc and curve around that smooth round disc and blow through the air cap without turbulence so it takes all the turbulence out and it squeezes the air out through the horns and through the center of that air cap in a very soft manner so I can get in closer now I'm not going to drive solvent or water into the base coat I'm not going to drive solvent into the clear coat like you used to happen and so I've got a great way of getting close to the panel and the closer I spray to that panel the faster my work speed is also the higher my transfer efficiency use the finer my atomization is so everything improves I cut my material losses everything improves alright so guys are you using the right air pressure at the wall getting the right feed and volume and flow to the gun and getting it at the right distance of the car are critical sometimes more critical to the performance of necessarily looking at the text sheet and going on must be spraying at this specific you know rate of pressure for that paint it will improve your performance it will improve the throughput in the shop and I'll improve your profitability on paint materials Thanks you", "Gvkj-xZCqjw": "on this episode of hands on cars Kevin\nshows you how to prep a car and paint booth before giving you great tips and\ntricks as he sprays base coat and clear on the camaro with the eastwood\nconcourse pro paint gun hey guys kevin gates for hands-on cars\nwell the day is finally here project said sled is prepped its prime\nit's blocked and it's ready for paint after months and months of work we are\nfinally here and I'm so soaked i can't believe it we're going to show you how to shoot\npaint and give you tons of other tips on how to get yourself out of trouble and\nhow to do proper paint prep including masking and I get to try out my new\nconcourse pro spray gun as well as show you guys how the new Eastwood 421\npremium show clear lays down on a vehicle like this now the vehicle is mostly masked up but we\nleft some spaces to show you how we did it because it's basically the same\ntechnique let me show you what I did obviously all\nthe panels are often the car we're doing this because we're shooting a solid\ncolor and I don't want any tape lines and I don't want to have to spend the\ntime and jamming it out backmasking and all that kind of stuff this saves us\ntime different color metallic color graphics well that's a\ndifferent strategy have made paper doors to keep the over spray from the inside\nkeep the desk from blowing into the outside and have skirted the entire\nvehicle all the way around to keep that overspray off of the newly painted\nsuspension components now these parts are sitting on a stand\nthat I've had for years it allows me access to all the areas i want to paint\non these parts if you don't have something like this\none you can get creative with your big 175 and make your stance the point is this eliminates the time\ninvestment in masking and eliminates the possibility of tape lines as well so\nit's a good idea now the front subframe you've seen\nbefore it's freshly painted and it's completely assembled so I've bagged it\nto keep overspray off of it as well as I've mask the firewall because I painted\nit as well will show you that a little bit but i wanted to say that your golden\nmasking is to keep your paper as smooth as possible that way you don't have\nfolds in areas that you're over spray can collect in and possibly get blown\nback out into the paint job areas like this it's really worth the time investment to give it a good\ninspection and come back flatten out spots like that just eliminate problems\nin almost every instance on this car i used a technique called backmasking or\nback taping this technique is clearly demonstrated in an education\ninstructional series but in case you haven't watched it going to show you\nwhat I'm talking about I like to use inch and a half inch tape\nbasically what I'm doing is using about half of it on the inside edge is\nself-explanatory I'm back taping and exposing the sticky\npart of the tape it makes it really easy to blanket this with another piece of\npaper and use the sticky part of the tape it just makes a nice job attachment\nbut i also like to use a little bit of reinforcement kind of like building a\nweb like this under here you can see what this is gonna do it was\na little bit of an area of support for the masking paper that we're gonna put\nin here just in case just in case it allows it to if you drop a tack rag on\nthere is not going to crash this up all in and now i take a very sharp single edge\nrazor blade and I'm lightly cutting just the paper not the masking tape underneath last step to take some of the masking\ntape and again sticky part of the tape to the sticky\npart of the tape makes this really easy now this fender has been prepped and\nsanded exactly the same way as the rest of the parts that you just saw in the\nspray booth and I've got it mounted on my super stand so i can get access to\nthe back sides of the panels and the jams so I don't have any over spray or tape\nlines when I assemble this car now this fender obviously hasn't been\nprepped at all it's in eastwood hi build 2k primer surfacer in black and although\nit's been body works it's nice and straight it's not prepped it's not ready for\npaint so we're going to show you exactly how we did it now there's a difference in the strategy\nbetween a solid color and a metallic color this obviously is getting a solid color\nis getting a black paint job so solid color you can get by with 400\ngrit being your last stage of sanding if you're spraying a metallic you want to\nfinish off with 600 grit that way the metallic particles don't end up in\nthose sand scratches and stand up and look weird so we're going to prep for 400 on this\npanel type now the goal is to finish off with 400\ngrit but i'm going to start with 320 now this technique is going to tweak\nsome of you hardcore restoration guys if you're watching but i have a collision\nrepair background so I know how to send with machines properly and if you don't\nabuse a dual action center it can really help you out this is flat\nthis is not this is flat this is flat it's a mating surface so\ni'm gonna show you how to use a DA sander to where you don't carve up your\npanel or round off any corners start off with the relatively low speed on your\nsander and just sand the flat parts this technique is about saving time and\ncreating a very flat surface for your paid to sit on you notice I'm using a\nlight touch and only sanding the flat surfaces the DA sander will damage the peaked\nedges and create Distortion on curved surfaces so you've got to stop with your\nflats are sanded now this is the same grade 3 20 on a soft Center you can see\nwhat i did but more importantly you can see what I didn't do I didn't ride my\nstyle lines I didn't ride my convex and complex shapes that's four hand sanding but we just\nbought ourselves a bunch of time and save yourself a bunch of rubber so now i can use blocking techniques one of the things I really like about\nthe east with black toque a primer is that it acts as it's on guide going you\ncan tell you send it through you can tell when you're done with his step and watch my technique the block face is\nrounded slightly and I'm rolling with this curve like I said we've done our\nbody work the panel shaped like we wanted and it's\nnice and straight where it needs to be nice and straight so I don't want to\nchange that by sanding and a lot of time priming and blocking and we don't want\nto go backwards we don't want to rob ourselves of having done all of that\nhard work on these Peaks style lines i found that if you're too crisp sometimes\nthey look a little weird so when i'm done blocking I skate over them just a\nlittle bit just a mute that peak edge and it's still nice and straight but it looks just real clean and real\ncrisp and just one step above factory your tendency is going to be to grab the\nair hose and blow the dust off and see if you still got some stuff to sand I want to change your mind on this yeah the most obvious benefit is that we're\nnot surrounded by a cloud of sanding this that I'm sucking up in my lungs the other benefit is that the dust has\ngone and now i can see if I'm finished sanding yet I've got a couple of\nholidays here some stuff on the top so i need to keep going just a little bit\nlonger with 320 but here's the real point of using the\nshop back for extraction if you hit with an air hose there's a\nchance that you can blow that sanding dust into a pinhole if you've got filler\nwork and you didn't know it was there it's going to show up in your paint job\nand cause you problems cause you solve the creator of fish I by extracting the\ndust you pull it out of those pinholes and they'll show themselves to you\nbefore you paint think about so now that I've got the surface exposed\nsand into i'm going to start using gloves because if it's a hot and sweaty\nday the sweat and the acid from my fingers can be deposited into the paint\njob and come up through that clear especially on a black ask me how I know so we're going to start with 400 so 400\nis the same drill but interestingly enough when you change grits and you\nsanded thoroughly to look at the panel changes so again the black toque a primer for me\nto it acts kind of as its own guide though even as you're switching grits\nmoving up through your project yeah red scuffing pads work great for\ninconsistent areas like this because you still want the paint to stick you don't\nwant to peel off and if it's not sanded it's not going to stick so these make short work of these types\nof areas you can fold it over do your inner crevices and cracks and\njust like I say in the paint education dvds the harder it is to sand the more\nimportant it is to sand it places like this this is not where you want delamination\nwhen your car is put together and go down the road i'm using my 402 hands--and if I blocks\nand across this this is just a line from the inner fender being pressed well I'm going to knock the top off i'm\nnot getting down in the group so with the gloves with the finger sanding I can get down in here and prep these\nsurfaces ok here's a problem that you might have if you remember we put filler on these\nedges to close up our panel gaps and look here there's a low spot so if i get in there with a sanding\nblock and I block that flat well I've changed the fitment of the fender to the\nhood I've created a gap there so this is the technique i want to show\nyou on how to get away with that you can fill that in and it won't show up in\nyour paint job when you open up that hood this is a contour polyester glazing\nputty and the catalyst that goes with it and this is a razor blade the reason I\nuse a razor blade so i can get a very small amount in a little bit of catalyst\nand I can mix it up a bit more catalyst people like Bob Ross here but I can mix\nit up you get a very small amount and go in\nand fix that pin hole with a very very tiny amount and I can judiciously apply\nit with my razor blade very flat it's minimal amount so my fingers have been sitting for a\ncouple of minutes it's sort of hard I've got 320 on a block and eastwood\npre-painting prep now here's where you got to know the\nrules before you can break them this is dry sanding paper and this is a wet\nsolvent but this is going to work so i'm using my pre-painting prep and a wet\nsanding situation what that does allow me to fill the low spot the\nsolvent activates the filler but not the cured primer around it so I'm not\ndigging into the sides i'm filling in and I'm leveling and I'm doing it quick\nand now I'm ready for a cedar and topcoat and you're never gonna know that\nspace was there and just to explain it again my filler is much softer than the\ncured primer around it the solvent makes it even softer so it\nmakes it easy for me to level this piece down not affect the edge around and not\naffect my panel fit between two panels and I fill in my pin hole so it's just a nice technique and one\nthat you can you can get away with something or if it's not really the\nintended purpose of that product but it works great right now we're going to wipe it down\nget it wet see what it looks like and get the first layer of dust off first\nbefore you wet check the final wife solvent now the last final step that I like to\ndo on something like this before paint is to wash it with soapy water use\ndishwashing soap too because it cuts the grease but before we do that I wanted to\nshow you are cool custom z28 side advance from the factory the z28 side\ngills went on from the outside and to me they always had kind of a cheap look\nbecause it's a cast metal it's not that great and it kind of\nbulges up so all we did was figure out a clamping mechanism from the back side\nand mounted them from the reverse and it's such a clean tasty tidy look that\ncost nothing hands on cars is brought to you by the\neastwood company when you're restoring a car truck or motorcycle Eastwood has\neverything you need to do the job right eastwood since 1978 now this is just a pump sprayer that you\nget from a home center what's in it is a dust control spray that you can get from\na body shop supply it just has a nice job of keeping the\ndust down in between coats but with the actual dust control spray from the body\nshop it stays wet through the whole paint job if you don't want to spend the\nmoney on this and you can just use the the pump sprayer with water and do it\nbetween coats it keeps you from having to run a hose\nin your booth it keeps the floor damp and it keeps\nthat over spray from being recirculated and deposited back down into your paint\njob now this stuff has nothing to do with\npaint but it has everything to do with controlling the outcome of your paint\njob it's obvious what this stuff does it kills bugs so whether i'm painting in a\nspray booth or just an open shop environment i always pop the top on a\ncouple of those guys the night before I'm going to spray it\njust helps you control that environment one other thing before I put anything\ninto my spray area again whether it's a booth or shop i vacuumed it like it's a hospital\noperating room get that stuff off the floor control\nyour environment keep those things from coming up into the paint job and a\nshopback is one of the best things that you can have around your shop for paint\nbooth prep whatever i'm prepping a vehicle or parts\nfor a paint job I use a three-step cleaning process\nstarting with the glass cleaner which is a nice organic debris cleaner I follow that with a prep solvent wipe\ndown pre-painting prep is a good one and then finally before i shoot paint i\nuse an alcohol wipe down in a pump sprayer the alcohol gets very aggressive\nthings like acidic fingerprints up off of the substrate and it works as a very\nnice anti-static spray as well and remember don't use paper towels as a\nfinal wipe spend a little extra money on some body shop safe Lynn free towels it's money well spent step one two three\nstep process the glass cleaner okay just to prove a point as clean as\nthat car looked look what I picked up off the surface\nyou're not ready even if it looks clean you gotta clean it here's the other\nthing this one's done it's gone get a new one you can spend a\nlittle money on towels but you can have a clean surface step 2 after the glass cleaner is\npre-painting prep you want to wipe one direction roll your rag you're trying to evacuate\nthe solvent off the top not rub it in again second stage look at the dirt i'm\npicking up this is why this is why three stages of preparation why it's so\nimportant you've got to be clean Betty your final\nwipes off and also gives you the opportunity to test for straightness\nit's another way to wet check the last of the three steps is the alcohol wipe\ndown and keep in mind this is isopropyl alcohol not rubbing alcohol it's a seventy-five percent alcohol\ntwenty-five percent water mix that I get from a local drug store what that does rather than rubbing\nalcohol is it has a higher flashpoint what is a higher flashpoint me well\nyou're not going to blow yourself up if you have a static charge on the surface\nlike fiberglass or something like that so keep safe use the 75 25 isopropyl\nalcohol smells minty fresh look at that where do I keep picking up\ndirt I don't know but i keep cleaning until my rags come off clean that was\ntoast the cars prepped we're ready to start\nspring we're using a 3 step system starting\nwith the East 1121 epoxy as a sealer coat the boulevard black base coat which\nis our colorful zetts let and the new 421 premium show clear now we're using a\nsealer even though the primer is black because as you can see I've sanded\nthrough some of the spots the sole purpose of a cedar is to get an even\nground code for the color so i don't have to stack up my color and put too\nmuch on so we start off with the black brown\ncoat then go to our color then go to clear which is the shiny step get some\nepoxy oh man this is a one to one mix ratio which is just all that says is\nequal parts so that's goes up to the five and take\npart b which is the catalyst poured in up to the 10 and then I start and spray\nit that simple I really prefer the mixing cups because\neven though they're tapered sides they've got all the divisions and you\nget a proper mixture ratio if you use a mixing stick like this you just stick it\ndown in your couple the sides are tapered so as it goes up the volume\nchanges your mix ratio changes and you always want to be accurate so what I do\nis use a mixing Cup and I drop in my PPS liner throw in a strainer always and then I strain into the cup liner top\non the top now i'm ready to shoot so let's talk about gun set up this is\nmike on course pro I've got the air valve at the bottom wide open the fan\nwide open and fluid delivery at the back end of the extent of the trigger everything is wide open until I start\nspring let's set up air pressure this is the east with digital air\npressure gauge it's a really nice piece but I don't like spring with it because\nit gets in my way just like this gauge here this is a passive gauge look at it it's\njust a brass tea and let outlet and a monitor this will tell me where I've arrived at\nmy perfect air pressure and then i can remove this and spray without this in\nthe way let me show you the trigger fully pulled\nthe gun a wide open looking at the gauges side to side i get\nmy 30 pounds of the gun inlet which is actually 33 pounds at the wall regulator so now but i know i've got an accurate\n30 psi at the trigger with a fully pull trigger now I can get rid of this thing\nand have a comfortable spray experience also want to mention i'm using giant\nHVLP fit is there a little more expensive than your typical npt or\nquarter inch fittings but the the difference is night and day in your\nspray guys you've got invest in the High Flow fittings and that includes your air\nhose three-eighths ID and your 38 ID couplers now we're ready to spray but I'm not\nready to spray look at this I just wipe the car down i\ngot a bunch of dust and stuff on me let's go clean up a booth box is real important it's got\nmasking tape tweezers a bug pic single edge razor blades some touch up brushes\nin case I need him and my glasses because I'm old I can't see it also\ngives me a place that's clean to keep my tack rags for wiping down between codes I let my tack racks it opened up for a\nfew minutes to mute the sticky so it doesn't stay on the panel for the first\ntak wipe I use a blow nozzle said about the same\npressure as I spray this blows out any dust particles and debris into the tack\nrag and get it out of the cracks and crevices lastly I ball up the tack rag loosely\nand give the panel's of final tacking just for good measure I keep a test panel in the booth to\ncheck my pattern before spring I never tested against the wall it's\njust bad practice and looks messy once the pattern looks good like a\nsquash football it's time to spray the epoxy goes down first with a single wet\ncoat I start on the roof working my way to\nthe middle with a 50-percent overlap to keep the code even and wet my gun has a\n1.3 fluid tip in it and I stay about 5 inches from the surface I moved to the quarter panel and work my\nway up to the sail panel then to the other quarter working my way up the car\nagainst the air flow of the booth the doors and every other surface gets\nthe same coat of epoxy which is a color cedar but also helps with adhesion of\nthe paint and don't be afraid to hit the decade got to get the hard spots - we\nlet the sealer dry for about 30 minutes which is just about enough time to\nproperly clean your gun if you sweat like a pig like me here's a\ntip take a clean wiping towel folded into thirds and tape it to your wrists\nmaking a homemade wristband our temps are about 80 to 85 degrees and humid and\nthis really helps keep the perspiration from dripping onto the panels even though the base color is black just\nlike the sealer it's a different material and slightly\ndifferent color so you need to thoroughly clean your gun every time you change materials\nespecially when you're using the same gun for multiple steps like we are aerosol injected cleaner from eastwood\nis perfect for this and actually saves you money by not have to use up a bunch of cleanup dinner and\nhaving to dispose of it afterwards it works on every part of the gun but\nespecially well on the air cap and air horns it's critical to have these super clean\nboulevard black base coat is next and we're mixing it into a cup for an\naccurate mix ratio every time since the basis of four to one mix i find the four\nto one column and pour from the left to the right first with the color then with the\ncatalyst remember the seven on the cup is not a mix ratio just a level on the\ncup mixing this way gives you a perfect for 21 mix ratio yeah ok we're attacking off the car again just\nin case there's over spray that we might kick up into the paint another shot onto\nthe test panel tells me the gun is set up right and we can start spring color i\nuse the same pattern spring the base coat as I did the sealer the same road\nmap but i'm using a sixty to seventy percent overlap and about four inches\nfrom the surface you will definitely get a feel for it as you read your pattern\nwhile your spring to keep the hose out of the car I usually have it over my shoulder and\nfeed it into my spring hand this gives you much better control and\nkeeps your air hose out of the paint you can see here we're skirting the car\nsaves the shiny stuff on the bottom and it also keeps from blowing debris from\nunder the car up into the rest of the paint job you can see I'm using a medium wet coat\nand not hosing the color on there is no strength in the base coat only pigment\nand resin so there's no need and no useful purpose in applying big fat coats typically i like to move from the bottom\nof the panels to the top this is working against the air flow of\nthe booth and helps eliminate dry spray on the doors or any other vertical\nsurface just like on the roof I use a push poll\nmethod on the hood pushing the paint into the middle and pulling it onto the\nother side this make sure I don't have dry spray in\nthe middle that I'd have to cover up with more paint because that can cause\nsolvent trapping problems I'm short and I need to school to finish\nthe top edge of the hood but that minor inconvenience is fine when we have the\nability to paint the top and the bottom of the panel's all at once this saves us time and materials but\nit's a little more work to get everything covered with the first coat\nflashed off which means dry to the touch the second coat follows the same route\nas the first again I work against the air flow of the booth that way the overspray gets pulled\nacross the freshly painted surfaces and cross links back into the fresh coat and\ndoesn't have the chance to become dry spray or dry over spray which can really\ncause you problems yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a magnetic gun holder in the booth can\nhelp keep your air hose off the ground which keeps a clean after the base is\nflashed we let the color sit for about another 30 minutes to an hour to fully\ndry before we clear code you can see here that it's just color and has no\ngloss for strength to it but the concourse program has handled both\nsealer and base coat perfectly i couldn't be happier with this gun or\nbase color is done we've got complete hiding and coverage\nwould look at me paint job is work folks and there's more than one reason to wear\na spacesuit not only does it keep the overspray off\nof me it keeps my sweat from dripping into that paint job in the summertime\nthis is going to be even worse if you're like me if you're a sweater well kids to the safety gear because its\ndual purpose it protects you and it protects the zed slip since we're\nchanging materials again we thoroughly clean the gun again\nbut the eastwood cleaning kit and aerosol injected cleaner make it super\neasy yeah yeah now we're a hundred percent clean ready\nto put clear coat to the same gun I put sealer and base color in and I'm\nconfident that this is not going to bleed any color am i clear we're using the eastwood show\nclear which is a four to one mix ratio but because the temperature is 80\ndegrees we'll be adding the slow reducer which\nmeans we'll be using a four to one to one column on the mixing Cup we're mixing a large amount because i\nknow it takes a quart and a half to get around the car so i'll be using the\nthree as a reference to give myself enough for two coats remember the three is just a reference\nnot an actual amount with the clear added to the first three and the\nactivator to the second three it's time to fill to the next three with\nreducer as you can see these cups from eastwood\nmake mixing easy and you get a perfect ratio every time now it's time for a final wipe down with\na tack rag for the clear into the gun and we get to start spring yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I like to wipe the hose with attack\nright between coats to make sure it's clean and doesn't deposit any debris every little bit helps we test the gun\nand we're ready to go the first thing I do is put a coat of\nclear on the paper to make sure no black / spray works its way onto the car into\nmy clear code then I follow the same pattern i established when I spray the\nsealer and the color this concourse program has worked great for everything\nup sprayed primer base coat and now clear Adam ization is perfect and it's\nreally versatile gun yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah while spraying the third and final coat\nof eastwood show clear we found some debris in the paint so the\ntweezers from my booth box I'm able to remove it and keep on spring the car is cleared and looks good but\nthe next morning we found a tiny defect in the clear a little fish I and since it hasn't been\n24 hours the clear hasn't completely cured so we can dip out a small drop of\nthe overmix leftover and dab it into the spot it will cross link back into the clear\nand become the same coding after some sanding and buffing it will be\ncompletely unnoticeable so now it is time to unmask those it's\nled ninja style I cannot tell you how good it feels to\nhave paint on Zed sled this is awesome because right now even\nthough there's a few more panels to paint with the body under paint now we\ncould drop the engine and transmission and can measure for the dr chef the\nwiring harness the HVAC system interior glass all this stuff is now just a\nmatter of reassembly the hard work is done and my gosh it's worth it because\ni'm very happy with the bodywork a black paint job hides nothing and even though the\nbodywork is good we've got some work to do on the clear coat there's a little\nbit of dust and stuff so coming up on hands on cars we're going\nto show you some surface correction techniques and color sanding and buffing\ntechniques that are going to show you how to make clear coat like this look perfect so we're excited about it\nI'm stoked head slate is a car again before we say\ngoodbye there's one more trick i want to show you when you saw that I had bagged\nthe front in the booth with plastic but before I did that I sprayed the subframe\ndown with the coating called liquid spray mess it's designed to protect the parts from\noverspray it's just a little bit of extra insurance and it doesn't matter if\noverspread collected on this stuff because it sits on top of the liquid\nspray mask and protect my paint like this you can see what happens that's that's a\nnice coating right there and it just comes right up if you get this stuff when it turns to a\nsoapy mess and just rinses off with just regular tap water it's a great insurance policy so make\nsure you subscribe to us on YouTube for more details on the sled and upcoming\nepisodes to where we teach you how to color sand and buff and make the finish\nperfect and finish out this car with the help of these wood products for now i'm\nkevin gates thanks for watching hands on cars do the\njob right help me on the next episode of hands on cars\nKevin bus the set sled and visit the AAC a museum in hershey pennsylvania yeah", "Fj5XGfXwnZc": "Machoke outro hey all you swingers of the male persuasion today we're going to demonstrate the notorious bolo round these requests poured in after we demonstrated Tim Hamilton's dumbbell and barbell slugs Wow I did have a lot of thumbs in my opinion these two rounds rated very high on the badass scale this one passed sideways through Kevlar body armor also made out of machined steel the dumbbell round had very impressive results rather than tumbling through the air these maintain an efficient aerodynamic profile until it strikes flesh then it begins tumbling causing maximum damage now let's take a look at the bolo rounds or macho gaucho these exotic rounds complete with their exotic price are restricted in some parts of the country oddly not in California costing around four times the cost of a traditional foster slug let's see what makes me so special let me use a clear chet ight hole with a clear overshot card on top to keep everything held inside inside we have the projectile itself riding in the shot cup of an mg42 style wadding normally used for steel shot the projectile consists of two lead balls connected with a metallic cabling that's easy to pull apart the lead balls measure roughly 1/2 inch in diameter or about 13 millimeters and when spread apart the span is about five inches or about 125 millimetres and there you go Europe now stop blaming me that you were not taught the imperial system while the weight of the projectile is a hefty 36 grams the weight of the powder load is rather light weighing in at only 17 grains don't you love all these crazy measurements welcome back to fledermaus errs hey today we're out here to try the macho gaucho this is around from fire quest that is supposed to be too heavy lead balls connected by a piece of cable so we cut one of them apart to take a look at what they with inside before we shoot them this idea came to us from you guys after we shot Tim with machinist we shot his dumbbell rounds and we had a lot of suggestions about shooting around it was two balls connected by a chain well the chain doesn't exist but two balls connected by a little piece of steel cable we're going to give them a try and see how they work our theory is that two balls crammed together with a cable are not going to separate out like they should and go fly-in downrange with a nice stretched out cable in between them as is shown on the picture but I think the two balls are going to probably stick together and just kind of keep that cable crunched up in there well let's give it a try and see what we can find how will they fare on the lead plate it so those things buried themselves into this lead plate not very deep but still impacted and as you can see on camera their little tiny steel cable fibers where one ball is stacked on top of the other ball with the cable smashed in between the two of them well it's accurate to you know it was yeah 20 yards maybe 20 yards and aiming for that little button okay oh I thought they would have used little piece of sticker in a nice little peephole there look at that and there's a cable all mashed up inside okay we have a low resolution with very high frame rate of 38,000 frames a second but we can clearly see that there is absolutely no separation of the two balls you're actually touching when they impact sucked oh boy okay 22 yards 29.9 go boys hit it in the door boys okay yep you hear that fat yeah here is the projectile as we found in the Kevlar now it's important to note that we were able to pull these balls apart so there is no fouling or nodding of the cabling to prevent them from spreading on their own now looking at the high-speed footage of this shot we could see that the balls have spread maybe the thickness of your thumb in this shot there doesn't seem to be any external force that would actually cause the balls to spread apart so let's try to influence that a little bit the way we'll do that is install what's called a rifle choke on the end of the shotgun this should provide a little bit of thin and a triple force yeah rifle choke in there now we'll see if that has any effect on it okay we're gonna find out if these are effective against drone attacks oh my Oh big splash out there right software hit the DDI maverick and the maverick phantom one it would have severed it severs the wires sever the wires just so we can shut it down we're just trying to shut it down not destroy it now one of the balls you can see hit right there and it's a pretty big big ball they're bigger than the in a doubleheader out there so you can see that one hit right there and tore the body out of it and the other barely skimmed that arm right there and ends up tearing the wires out from underneath well I'd say we effectively brought down this drone at 25 yards yeah okay Dukey top here is your review of your drone that you sent me that I couldn't even charge up because you sent a European plug thank you using the rifle choke had no added effect to this the balls again had very minimal spread hey well decapitate a ballistic guilt gummy bear hit it look at him Wow steel splashes okay again the balls are touching and you have to ask is that's so bad well yeah because we were promised cheese cutter like performance and we expected to slice this gummy bear made out of ballistic gel completely in half and this thing just behaved like a low-power slug what are you are 18 yards who knows who she's talking all on a vaguely Asian reporter ready I'm ready Wow solid I was both balls please they they crew the thing was probably worth at least 1995 somebody online will tell us that it was worth a thousand dollars yeah it was worth it though she evidently took one of the forehead one of the balls I don't know what organization every time we predict what happened we're completely wrong when we show the I see footage I say I'm ready for chips into the road hot shot now as I often say slow motion does not like again the balls had almost no separation and instead of slicing the doll in half we just got kind of a mediocre impact with it what's into that impressive now you got to look at the bright side at least these rounds are accurate it would have really sucked if we missed every shot okay I'm ready macho culture oh I don't know I see one good hold on there I'll say mr. senator of the blue they obviously tore apart because we've got a bully impact hole here and the yellow out here this one kept the cable with it you see it did a little whiplash thing in there so it cut all the way through it cut all the way through if you come around the backside it a nice little flash okay now you can also hear I don't know if you can hear on camera but this one hit later than this one too there was a little bit of a zip sound to it so the cable slowed it down I think a little bit this was shot at about 35 yards and I want to be the first one to say that Greg was wrong the one with the cable attached actually hit first and out of the six rounds that we fired this was the only one that had a catastrophic failure the bubble round definitely has a nasty reputation but it's got a reputation that it really doesn't deserve it's a pretty low power round and it definitely doesn't function like we would expect it to with the cables spreading out now just adding more powder to it to make it more powerful probably would have worked against the design we saw that one round actually ripped the cable out of one of the balls so we probably would have seen more of that occurring just from the stress of trying to propel it much faster now ballistic machinists CNC machined steel slugs are the real deal and he is actually going to begin sewing these pretty soon and I said it because a lot of people have asked this if Tim sells the round side we have tested in some of our videos and it's kind of gone from a hobby into a potential business for Tim so that's really good news for him of course machining a slug out of Steel is a lot more expensive and time-consuming than just casting something out of lead so I'm kind of surprised he's able to price those slugs at such a competitive price I hope you enjoyed

there's\nan air control here is your fan pattern measure measure your trigger control\ndown so i'm actually going to use this air regulator as well typically I don't like an air regulator\nat the butt of the gun and it's partly because my hands are small but it's also\nbecause the mechanics of it see what is happening there it's hit my\nforearm I don't like it I want this and then its cues that my\nhand position and become uncomfortable and by the time i get 5 quotes around a\nconversion van I'm tired so I like to set my wall\nregulator actually I've got a regulator like this that i can set my pressure free down the gun set my wall regulator\nbased on the pressure here and then i can safely remove this get it out of the\nway get that restrictive valve out of the way and be confident that I knew got\nthe the inlet pressure that have preset we're going to stick with it here\nbecause the wall regulators about a hundred and eighty feet away so we're not going to go there so I had\na little mixing up here we go it looks like it does actually look like\ncoffee dunkin donuts it's about the consistency\nof today's clear coat like I said it's like pancake syrup its water based paint we got it at\nwalmart and it's just it's you know it's his water paint on course to about 20\npsi the inlet so we're going to set it at that you've\ngot several controls on this gun which are universal you've got well this isn't always on\nevery gun i like this feature because I can choke the the pressure back if I'm\nyou got a little tight recess that I want to score a little bit extra if I've missed have got some dry spray\nand a wheel arch I like to bring the air pressure down and kind of missed it back\nin without blasting all the rest of the panel so this is a nice feature to have but it's not a hundred percent necessary\nso you've got a fan control up on the top which I'm going to die all the way\nin and your fluid control which as you can see doesn't allow any paid out for\nyour fluid control and there's theories all over the place on the fluid control I like to open the gun up and let it do\nwhat it's going to do this is a carburetor a carburetor mixes air and\nfuel and atomizes it this is a carburetor it just doesn't\nhave gasoline in it it's got your pain in it so to me somebody has been a lot of time\nthere's an engineer that's developed and designed this gun to a demise paint\nproperly okay see what happens we've got a lot of\npaint coming out and my fan pattern is in a . and there's a purpose for that\nbut it's not really painting cars so now I've got my fluid delivery wide\nopen so i'm going to back my fan control off to where I have the football shape it's an elliptical\npattern and that's precisely what you want if it's heavy on one side or the other\nside for instance if you've got a pattern it looks kind of like an eight chances\nare your air pressure is too high and it's blowing it out the air horns are\nare shooting air into the point to where it's week in the middle and heavy on the\nsides typical troubleshooting as well if\nyou've got a pattern that kind of looks like a banana one of your air horns is probably\nplugged up typically it's so the opposite side -\nwhat the pattern is looking like and again if you got a pattern that's\nreally heavy on one side and light on another side chances are you've got some kind of\ngummed up your needle seat is probably got something built up on it so that's a\ngreat excuse to break the gun down clean it up and start over again and we'll\ntalk about gun cleaning - and that brings up another point has\nanybody ever bought a spray gun took it out of the box put some pain in it and\nshot a panel and not had problems has anybody ever done that I've done it\nI got excited I was I had a job to shoot and pull the paint gun out of the box\nand you know i got by with it I got away with it but sometimes there are coatings\nthat are put on these the spray equipment that is designed to keep it\nfrom corroding so when you get to see you when you get a paint gun in a box\nlike this chances are it's at a warehouse is sat\non a manufacturing line they put coatings on it anything from cosmoline to kerosene\nstuff it's it's aluminum on the inside its machine on the outside and anodized\nbut it's not in the inside the internal fluid passages are all aluminum so they\nwant to coat that so in case it sits on a warehouse or a loading dock somewhere\nfor a year and a half it's not going to corrode on the inside\ncause you guys problems that makes it very very important to clean that gun\nthoroughly quick break it apart pull the needle and seat out of it break it apart\npull the cap off clean it clean it thoroughly and then put it back together\nshoot some solvent through it and then you can start effectively on your paint\njob it's very important that so it's a\npretty heavy-duty troubleshooting thing and talking to the guys at the tech\ncenter here they have that conversation a lot\nwith people that bought a spray gun and they've they've pulled it out of the box\nthinking well it's new it should be perfectly clean it's not\nand it's not the fault of the spray gun it's not the fault of eastwood it's not\nthe fault of sada of of NS to WOD it's not the fault of anybody to build this\nnobody counts on you guys not cleaning your equipment first it's not in the instruction sheet but\nit's a really good idea to keep back here so that's one way that you can eliminate\na problem so Greg yes he was talking to greg was talking\nabout overlap typically you want a 50-percent overlap\nnow there's there's reasons that you want to break that rule but a 50-percent\noverlap is is pretty much industry standard now what that means obviously is that\nyou're overlapping and I'm moving up halfway through that pattern and again that builds this coding evenly\nall the way through that paint job so you're fifty percent overlap is\npretty darn important so we've got to spray technique how many\nguys are painted an entire car there's a method that i called\nleapfrogging it's on the page occasion instructional dvds on the patreon car\nvideo basically is where to start and where to stop on it on an entire paint\njob so i will actually eventually get to a point here but on the education DVD i\nstarted the roof I do what's called a push-pull method i\npush into the middle of the panel walk around the side of the car drag it off\nthe middle of the panel down onto the onto the sail panel work my way across\nthe deck lid quarter quarter door door fender fender hood front I'm done that's my coat so the push-pull\nmath and now I've worked around painters that have fantastic results doing the\nopposite of what i'm going to tell you to do and I'm not here to say that Tim\nstrange or Charlie hot nor those guys can't paint because they do what I'm\ntalking about and whatever what I mean is it they'll\nstart in the middle of a hood and they'll work their way down and then\nthey'll come over here to the other side of the hood and then they'll work their\nway down here again that's not what i like to do and it's\nnot what works best for me and it's not what I like to coach people on what I\nlike to do is start on an edge typically i'll even start here i'll come down here\nand work my way to the middle of that panel if i can go all the way across and\nkeep it continuous i will but what I'm doing here I'm in danger of my air hose hitting\nthat panel if I've got a spray suit on that I haven't taped around my waist there's a danger of that hitting the\npanel because I just painted that that's brand-new wet coding seconds ago so what I want to do is work my way\nuntil i'm right at the end of my comfort zone then I'm going to come around pick up\nthat wet edge and drag it it's like laying and rolling out a piece\nof fabric on top of the surface so you're basically rolling out that\nrole of paint now what happens and this is what happens and doesn't\nmean that those guys are getting good results doing that but what happens when\nyou start in the middle is that you have a coat of paint here and I'm working my way down here in the\nminute 5 minutes 10 minutes depending on the size of the panel that you've spent\nhere what's happened to this edge it's gotten\ndrive exactly so now what you have to do yes you can\noverlap it but if you use the same overlap in the same time and the same\nrhythm that you pick up on doing this panel well you've got a big dry spray there if\nyou hammer that paint to where it's going to melt in you've over coated so\nnow you've got three coats in the space of one coat in order to wet it enough to\ncarry on the procedure that you could have made easier by working your way and\nstarting from one side and working your way to the other side it's called picking up the wedge and\nit's just a simple mechanical thing I go to my comfort zone I come back around it takes three\nseconds to walk around the car I don't have to run because I've got\nenough time and I pick up that wedge and I work my way across the panel and like\nI said it's like rolling that piece of felt across that hood and it's a very\ncontinuous motion and it's smooth our goal here is to seem like we've\ndipped that car into the paint by using the leapfrog method starting\none side of the roof over to the other side of the roof down the sail panel\ndown the other sail panel over the decklid across the back now i'll eat\nproblem to the door and I blend my panel and we probably the other door and come\nto the fender work move across the hood then to the fence and then to the other\nfinger now to the front of the car that's the pattern i use it's like a\nmantra for me and it creates this envelope of paint that swallows the car\nand it's one continuous coat instead of fighting that paint fighting those dry\nedges I'm just going to keep talking if you\nguys want to ask questions because there's yes sir yes sir what about wait you're fighting the edge okay and you're trying to see it ok the question was what if you're using\na light color like white and you're trying to use overlap and you're trying\nto fight that it could be because you have to pick up the wedge if you can't\nsee the wedge you can't find it you can't drag it\nacross the panel it's a very serious problem and it's something that you have\nto overcome and here's how I overcome it basically when you look at something\nlike this when I'm standing like this i can see the paint go down but if I've\ngot a light grey silver and white paint or I'm on my third coat of white paint\nyes it becomes a problem so what do I do there's always light\nthere's a light source somewhere whether it's a son whether it's fluorescent lights in a\nprofessional booth or whether you're you got a homemade lighting setup hopefully that's safe you can find that\nlight the way I find that light is to stand off the side now I need a volunteer somebody come on what's your name sir Pat I'm Kevin thank\nyou I'm sorry I'm chip hi ok when you're looking stand right where\nI'm standing right there now when you look at that tape you can't\nsee the reflection can you come down a little bit and come over to the side now you can see all kinds of reflection\nright right yeah so what you've done is you've found your light thanks appreciate it ok the simple\naction of changing where you are and letting the light hits your eyes that's how you find that wedge is it\nuncomfortable yeah it doesn't cost you to paint job\nyou don't have dry spray when you go to buff the car so find your light source and it's the\nsame way when you're using when you're when you're clear coating it's\nespecially important as your base coats they'd all down and i'm assuming\neverybody here is using base coat clear coat systems right your base coat a dull down that's good\nyou that's what you want that's what tells you you're ready for the next coat\nand that's what tells you you're ready for a four-year clear coats especially\nwith waterborne and we can talk about that if you want to or we don't have to\nbecause we're hobby guys we don't have to right now so thank goodness for that\nbut anyway you find your light source by manipulating where you are and looking\nto find it looking to see it and that's the best method for me to to paint clear\ncoats as well just like when you're hammering a nail you've got to be there you got to have\nthat you know but with a spray painting I can get down here and i can get on\nabout a 45 degree angle and I can see precisely where that's reflecting i can\nfind the smallest amount of light and I can cite and I can see where my overlap\nis hitting so it's it's about changing your body position to find the light that's pretty much the the answer that I\nwanted to get just find it very hard it is hard it's tough yeah yeah yeah and that's it brings up another thing\nabout it it's really important to wear eye protection really important even if\nyou're wearing my ask a respirator force there whatever I protection allows you\nto do one thing that's really relevant to that problem it allows you to get really close\nbecause the bounce back from that spray gun can get into your eyes so you don't\nwant that I sign a urethane catalyst is moisture\ncured it cures with the moisture in the air so when you spray it with your mucous\nmembranes open with your lungs your mouth your eyes mucous membranes what do we have in our\neyes there's tears there's moisture so when that stuff hits your eyes it kicks not good if it if you have a\nway to protect your eyes from that even if you're wearing just a respirator mask\na pair of safety glasses even to keep that bounced back from going into your\nyou know throw away at the end of the paint job have some goggles that are\nvented on the top protect your eyes it not only keeps your\neyes safe but it allows you to not squint and fight that panel but you can\nget up close just like you're welding you can get up close to that sucker and\nyou can see the weld pool now you can get up close and you're not\nafraid of the paint coming into your eyes you're protected you're smart for doing\nthat but you can also get right up close to that thing and in a difficult\nsituation find your light so there's another safety plug for a reason that's\nalmost as good as safety and you had a question for them please it seems like that the god awful slow to\nget it the come out right right see these guys on TV either\nfreaking with through is that films it up it's not film speed at the question is\nhe's got a slow delivery rate on his base coats and all these idiots on TV the P Carson TV or rock and roll and\nwe're going fast it's not sped up film it's it's a\nquestion of technique here okay when I'm spring up here watch what\nhappens look at my gun distance this is exaggerated of course look at what happened to that pattern\nit's splotchy it's misty and I went really slow watch what happens now now i'm in my\nsweet spot see what that did I've got a fat even\ncoat there and I rock through that sucker so a very very smart man his name is hub\nForrester and he taught me about painting fast and he said you're going\nto have to learn you're gonna have to keep your distance separate but try it\nmy way and he he gets down this guys 84 years old he's still teaching pay\nclasses he is a hero of mine he's a fantastic instructor but he's pain like\nthis and he is rocking through the sand and he has perfect paint he paints Steinway pianos for high-end\nclients he's a master and he taught me that technique and it serves me very\nwell so that's probably I'm guessing what\nyou're seeing in some of these shows yeah open your fan up a little wider get\nyour get your gun distance lower you're gonna have to really refine your skills\nand you know take your paintbrush whatever you know nobody's looking\nnobody's going to make fun of you for a paper a statue pneumatic spray gun but\nthat can perfect that technique for you and with these HVLP guns there's a rate\nof atomization as you get farther away your particles are farther apart just\nlike when i raised the gun distance the particles here are very far apart up close they're very close together and\nthey're a lot smaller so your fan pattern it's a finer mist\nit's a finer atomization as you find that tight sweet spot here's something that I want to yes their delivery it could be an air\ndelivery problem great great statement great observation it could be an air\ndelivery problem what's your air compressor set up so you're okay so yeah it's probably not\nthat but if you're working with the three horse 30 gallon yeah you could be having base\ncoat problems and as slow application time based on based on air delivery another thing is is the fluid tip size\nthis ship with a 1.2 my opinion I want to spray base coach especially metallics\nwith a 1.4 1.6 is a little too fat but I like a 1.4 it's what I've gotten\nused to not saying you can't with a 12 but a 14 works best for me and it works\nbest for a lot of guys that I coach on a hobby level now you're clear manufacturers typically they are because each paint\nmanufacturers is a little bit different with with what they wear their\ncompositions and the reducers and so you follow the guide follow the P sheets on\nthe paint east has got great guys on their payment systems and it just follow\nwhat what they recommend whether it's BSF PPG doesn't matter they've got great piece she said that\nengineers that have that have figured out all these systems want you to hear\nsomething how we doing for time Randy ok so this\nis called the wall of air test a friend of my name is Gary Alaska he's\non the education forum he's he's a brilliant guy he's a home\nhobby guy he is actually a railroad engineer for a living and that but he\nhelps me he helps guys he's a master welder you whatever i\nuse a good buddy and he helps me out a lot on the on the forms and he taught me\nthis test is called the wall of air test what you listen real carefully you hear\nthe sound ok it's a rudimentary test is a very\nfundamentally simple test when you hear that sound look at the\ndistance between my gun and that fluid tip about four inches a big seven your wallet there would be\nabout here that's a really good idea to find the\nsweet spot of that finest atomization in your spray gun whatever the gun is\ntypically with an HVLP gun like this conflict about four inches from the\nsurface so if you're spraying base code up here\nand you haven't done your wall of air test you know I've got the flu delivery\nchoked off so i can think about painting my hand four inches well that's about that's about that distance that's not\nthat high that's not that high off of that panel\nnow you can tighten it in and you get a finer atomization your pattern goes down\nbut your atomization is up it's smaller it's finer so it's really\ntight to the surface these days guys it's really close to the painting\nsurfaces so all these factors your air delivery your technique mostly and the way you're holding your\ngun to the panel the way you've reduced the paint if you're following the pea\nshoots them and the recommendations this is giant wonderful recipe of this\nbeautiful soup that we make and we paint a car with so all of these things matter\nthat wewe got any any other questions anything with primer primer is that the\nsame with primer yes it is primer surfacer primer is a\nmisnomer the primer means many different things there's primer surfacer this\nprimer sealer there's there's all kinds of primers metal coatings there's high\nbuild primers there's blocking primers all that kind of stuff and primer\nsurfacer is what we're going to be talking about which is a high bill\nprimer this meant to surface an area to level\nit down and make something smoother and set it up for the top coats so your\nprimers range from anything to wear i would recommend anything smaller than\n1.6 fluid tip on primers that's the minimum now some of these higher build primers\nhave a higher viscosity the urethane primers are a little bit thinner what I've really come to love our the\npolyester primer surfaces i used to use a brand called clausen\nit's a high build Polly primer and we use them on the TV shows and this stuff\nis great is very high build it was first developed to do hail damage and to fill in the hail\ndance to where you could block and flat without having to pop the dents out and\nand Polly has been around for a long time\ndoes anybody remember feather Phil feather filled is where I learned how to\nblock cars and I had this guy that was mean as heck it was working at a shop\ncalled alejandra portion in Southern California just off in a speech and one\nalejandra said okay he called me killer because you can\nremember my name but he said killer we're going to block this car with we\nshoot it with feather fill which God is as hard as this concrete parking lot if you remember blocking feather filled\nand this guy does and you know he would let it sit for three or four days out in\nthe California Sun and you say okay Katie guide coat and block it and you\nknow the way to hit feather feelings about 40 minutes after you shoot it\nbecause it's still soft enough it is it seriously anyway but taught me not only\nnot to listen to want but but it taught me how to block panels you know and you\nknow but but feather filled used to be the high build Polly and it's beautiful\nstuff it's great stuff it was really brittle - so if you have\nany kind of flexing the part sometimes when you stacked it really high it would\ncrack the polyesters today are much more sophisticated and like I said on jaded\nwe used all the eastwood products including the brand new poly fill er\nit's a polyester hi build filler and it's beautiful stuff in powders like\nbutter it's amazing and powders like lacquer primer months after I sprayed it we probably did five sessions of priming\nand blocking on that car to get it straight and the car is nice and\nstraight i'm very proud of the body work on it and I'm not the only one that did\nbody work on it but we use the polyfill almost exclusively the other thing about the old-school\nPolly's the old feather Phil's is that it was like concrete it was so porous\nthat you had to put a 2k or lacquer on top of it for your pain to sit on these\nnew policies like the eastwood Polly you don't have to so I like the class\nand stuff I love the eastwood stuff because it powders nice it blocks nice i can top coded and I'm\ntrying real hard we're meeting with the R&D guys to talk them into offering\ndifferent colors so now you can bypass a sealer step if you got a dark color\nthese two parties are really bright color it's almost white it's beautiful primer but so far they\nonly come in that color is JR kicking around anywhere so we're going to talk to those guys see\nif they can make different colors like a dark and a maybe even a red tint something like\nthat but for primers for the pollies i will get to your point in the question\nto point out or larger that's a garden hose that's the giant\nfluid tip you have to have it because that stuff is so thick and it's so\nthere's almost no solvents in it which is part of the beauty of it it's about\neighty percent solids which means only twenty percent of that liquid evaporates\noff so what you spray on that car stays on that car so it gives you a lot of\nmeat to block so your policies need a big fat fluid\ntip now the concourse I'm sorry the evolution gun comes to the\nto point out and I did all Polly's with the evolution gone jaded so the tools and equipment are here there's there's other guns with larger\nfluid tips yeah you can you can accommodate that but if you try and shoot Polly through\n1.6 it's not going to happen it's going to be really dry and unless\nyou cut it with acetone then then you're you're you're really shooting yourself\nin the foot and even when you add acetone to it you're adding a solvent to\na product that's not designed to have solvent so invest in a two point of\nfluid tip they sell the fluid tip separately here as well so that's a\nreally nice add-on to have you can have a multi-purpose gun several different\ntips you don't have to buy five guns you can have five tips and one gun so\nfor primer surfaces did that kind answer your question okay cool deal what about for your things Hillary your\nthemes who I would go with the 16 or 18 because\nyou're gonna get you know you can add another half part of reducer if you want\nto really lay flat and not really violate any any film build issues or\nanything like that and if you're doing a sealer for the\npurpose of a sealer then yeah you can use a 16 or I wouldn't use the one at\none point six I think would be good that brings up something how many guys\nuse a sealer before they put their topcoats down why do you use a sealer do if it's if\nthere was some body work done yet and everything all one color tomorrow yep wight zoo that has like the market\nkit yeah black parts yeah the white ceiling one\nand I know I'm you know working with ya what's your name dogs reason for using a\nsealer is the reason that i use a sealer it's to get a continuous ground coat\ncolor in which you put my top coats on top of now I've seen guys not use a\nsealer and have a leopard spotted paint job and have to use twice as many base\ncoats especially reds or light blues you have to use twice as much base coat\nand sometimes you still get those spots ghosting through I've also seen guys with a primer job\nthat's perfect it's hi Bill primer toque a poly\nwhatever its hi Bill primer and it's all one color and their spot primed and\nthey've got nothing covered up and it's great and they're painted white and they\ngo ahead and put a great sealer coat on that because that's what they remember\nthey should do now what they've done is they've added another layer of solvents\nthat has to evacuate and evaporate out of that paint job and now they're going\nto put their five coats a top coat on it and three coats of clear or six coats\nclear how much clearer going to understand solvent so my point is any\ntime you can do what he does and eliminate the need for a layer of\nsolvent please do it because it's going to serve\nyou in the end solvents are the necessary evil of paint it has nothing\nto do with paint it is called a transfer vehicle it's like getting on the bus to go to\nwork solvent and ended the the bus goes away you're still at work that's precisely\nthe function of solvent in pain we gotta have it because we have to turn it from\na liquid to a solid the solids are what's left over i've been talking about\nhigh solids low solid slacker seventy percent solids hi go Polly eighty\npercent solids the solvent which is the twenty percent of that gets out of Dodge you're left with what hard what's what what cures so anytime\nyou can eliminate a layer of solvent that has to evacuate it is not a part of\nthe equation of paint solvent is bad solvent is not her friend it has to\nhappen we have to dance with it we have to learn to love it we have to fight it at times solvent pop\ntrapping issues i know you guys have had these things on your clear coat so you\nknow with the little pimples and stuff it just makes you mad because that\nsolvent is not is not cooperating it's a necessary evil of painting so you\nhave to learn the rules you have to learn to work with it so anytime like I said I keep hammering\nthis point any time you can eliminate a layer of solvent in your paint job you are better off so a sealer coat is\nyes it's a great idea because it eliminates three coats of base coat that\nyou just don't have to put on that car anymore so now you've eliminated three\nlayers of solvent that has to evacuate it's got to get out of Dodge so anyway you can facilitate that you're\nbetter off yeah you like a blue truck and got just\ndid I i did see lord blue gap the first code bases yeah you've almost got a hundred percent\nhiding on your first coat so yeah that's that's that's one of\nthose things where you got to kind of know the rules - - like I said dance with the devil and\nand you know that's kind of what we're doing work where we're navigating a\nminefield of crap that can happen and go wrong and hopefully you know if at the\nend of the day we followed most of those rules we can come up with a nice paint\njob and and you know that's that's the goal is to get nice work what about a few flat panels that you be\nthe chemically stripped or sandwich who is going to be a wall before you\nactually want to paint the far right you recommending to the car with your things\ndealer or what I like to use i like to use an epoxy sealer and for instance the\nMustang keep going back to that because it's just the last paint job that I did\nfor the last full restoration that I did we had it media blasted and when I got\nit back actually at the media blaster are we went ahead and coated with epoxy\nas soon as it came out of that that blast bay so we coded it was on a\nrotisserie is on a buck we coated it with one really fat coat of\nthese with epoxy it's a one to one mix it's very easy to use and we use black\nbecause my top coat color is going to be dark it doesn't matter what color but a\npox he gives a nice band-aid it will stop it from flash resting and it\nactually there's a window of about seven or eight days to where you can apply\nyour fillers that epoxy without having to sand it so it gives you a nice work\nwindow for for you doing your filler work or like you said protecting your car weekend warrior guys\nwe can't do the bodywork on an entire car over the course of a weekend you're\ngoing to do a panel at a time and this question comes up an awful lot I'm going to media blast my car because\ni want to see where the metal is what do i do to keep it from rusting coated with\nepoxy attack at one panel at a time even if you have to strip that panel off\nto get down to doing rust repair strip the epoxy off leave it sit on the rest\nof the car stop it from rusting so great question\nand that's that's honestly what I do with just about every single thing I do rarely i do i work on top of their steel\nis there any other questions yes sir were you your place to get some of the pictures\naren't going to guarantee their pain because ok is is is a question was he read well you read somewhere that some of the\npaint manufacturers are going to honor the warranty the paint if you media blast the car now that may\nbe the case when you're talking about soda blasting which is different than\nalmost any other abrasive video is very mild it doesn't profile the metal which\nmeans it doesn't poke holes it doesn't ruin that that mill scale on that metal\nand it leaves a much nicer smoother surface so I like soda blasting however it's very very important that\nyou use some sort of a cleaner that dissipates that sodium layer that's on\nthere now there's guys they'll say well so Diaz or sodium soda-blasting is\nnothing more than salt salt is sodium so you're going to introduce the rest\nwill know if there's a thin film that sits on that panel that actually\ninhibits rust once you get a soda blasting but you\nhave to have to have to have to have to get that coating off of there any stores\ngot some great chemicals to wash that there's there's an after blast chemical\nthere's some other etching property chemicals that will take and clean thank you like this guy he's covered all\nof our but we will be on the news that takes all of it but yeah you got to make\nsure if you're using soda to go ahead and and and clean that off and get your\nsubstrate ready for something so yeah it's not a bad thing but you just got to\ndo that extra step to prep for it listen guys I want to say thank you very\nmuch for sticking around as long as you did and I hope I've answered some of the\nquestions if anybody got anything else to say please you know give me a shout we're\ndoing two more of these today we're doing what - 12:30 and then one at three\no'clock and you know it always changes it's always different were going to be\ntalking about fundamentals but if you're around well we'll get on another line of\nquestions and subjects and thank you very much and you know thank you to the\neastwood company let's give those guys a huge chance for putting this stuff", "NJ0rToBHYtQ": "hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make a bread pudding which is a great way to use leftover stale bread first thing is preheat our oven 300 degrees Fahrenheit that's 150 degrees Celsius and there are two parts to a bread pudding there's the bread and then there's the custard we'll start with the bread you need 8 cups that's about 2 litres of bread and you can use any stale bread you have white white bread you could even use whole wheat and French Italian sandwich bread and just cut it into bite-size pieces now you can leave the crusts on or you can take them off just keep in mind if you leave the crusts on your bread pudding will be a little more chewy than if you take them off and then you need a 9 by 13 inch that's 23 by 33 centimeter baking pan that is either buttered or lightly sprayed with an on cook on vegetable spray and just put your bread cubes in there and evenly distribute them and then if you want you don't have to do this I like to add about a cup of fruit it's about 240 milliliters and I'm going to use a combination of raisins I'm using gold in here but the dark I mean you could use some dried cherries or cranberries whatever you'd like here and then I'm going to also add I've chopped up some apple into just bite-sized pieces and just evenly distribute this over the top of the bread and some people like to add chunks of chocolate lemon zest okay so that's that now when you bake a bread pudding we need to use a water bath and this will protect the custard from curdling which means it separates into the solids and liquids which while I mean it doesn't affect the taste it doesn't look very good when it separates so what you need to do is have a large roasting pan that's a little larger than this pan enough room so we can pour some hot water around the outside of this pan and I like to put a just a dish cloth in the bottom of my roasting pan so it doesn't bang around and just put it in like this so now we have enough room to pour in some hot water and now we're going to make the custard I make the my custard a little different I don't just stir everything together I like to beat the eggs and sugar first and that this will give us a really nice light and fluffy bread pudding so if you have an electric stand mixer like this use the paddle attachment or you could just use an electric hand mixer put four large eggs and I have those at room temperature and one cup that's 200 grams of granulated white sugar and I'm just going to beat this on high speed probably about four or five minutes until they're the they become really thick and lemon colored so well choose D takes four or five minutes okay we're done so this is what you're looking for lemon color very nice and thick this will really help give our bread pudding really nice light texture not so dense there's a lot of other recipes so we're going to now add one and a half teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and I like to add a little cinnamon just a half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon if you're if you don't like cinnamon just leave it out and I'm just going to beat that in all that's left is to add the milk or cream now we need four cups which is about a liter and keep in mind you can use cream or milk or combination of the two the heavier the fat content of this what you're using the richer the bread pudding will be so I have used a combination of milk and cream obviously if you want a really rich bread pudding you'd use quite a bit of heavy cream I've used a combination of milk and half-and-half so I'm just going to stir that in and then I the last thing is four tablespoons about 57 grams of butter that has been melted and then cooled to room temperature sometimes if you don't let your butter cool enough or if your your milk and cream is cold the butter will kind of Harden don't worry about that that's okay once it gets in the oven it'll melt again so that's it now just gently pour your custard over your brand and then with some either you use your hands or I'm going to use a spatula just press down to make sure you want to get all that bread and covered in that nice custard now if your bread was really stale you could let this sit for half an hour an hour before baking and that way the the bread will soak up the custard especially if your if your bread is quite stale takes a while for the custard to soak in mine wasn't it was just maybe a day old so it's not that stale so I can bake it right away now just press okay looks good now what we need to do is pour in either hot your from your tap or if you have a kettle boiling water and what you want is enough water to come up about half way up the side of your our baking pan so gently pour that in okay that's good now we got to carefully put it in the oven you want to bake it for about an hour now that's going to vary from oven to oven Plus how hot your water is in your water bath but you want to bake it until you can put a toothpick in the center which should come out clean or if you just gently press on your on the bread there you won't see any custard come up the liquid so it's got to be set so somewhere around an hour okay our bread pudding is done you can see it when you press it it's set if you put a toothpick into the center would come out clean and then we need to get it out of the water bath so it doesn't keep cooking so just very gently and carefully you don't want to burn yourself because that water is quite hot and just put it on a wire rack like this and let it cool you know 5-10 minutes and this is good warm at room temperature or even cold and you could just dust it with some powdered sugar or if you want to have it for dessert you could serve it with either softly whipped cream or even ice cream so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "VsW86xHpocc": "hi everybody welcome back to sunshine soap and candle company tonight I'm gonna be showing you the candle and sunshine selfie candle company a lot of you probably don't know that I started out this business a long time ago making candles probably 18 years ago now and it has evolved into a candle soap cosmetic business candles were my first love I started them a long time ago and took a little bit of a break from regular candle making when I had kids and I've come back to it more recently so it is something that I really like I never stopped making candles I just stopped kind of mass-producing them and selling a bunch of them so my process has evolved a lot over the years and I just wanted to show you what it currently looks like and I will give this video a full tutorial for you so that you can follow this step-by-step if you want to do the same thing as well this is something that I probably really would have benefited from a long time ago when I first started making candles I learned from books and I checked out books from the library I bought some really good candle making books but I think a step-by-step tutorial that I could have watched online would have been something that would have helped a lot because you kind of have to go bright trial-and-error like which products work the best for you and all that so the benefit of this video for you if you want to make candles for yourself is that you're gonna get some expertise and some knowledge here that took me a really long time to get to so I'm hoping that this is beneficial for you and if you're just someone that likes buy candles and burn candles it's an interesting process to watch how hand poured candles are made so I will link everything below for you so you can order all the supplies that you want to if you want to use the same things that I'm using I'm also gonna do this video in phases so candle making is kind of a hurry-up-and-wait process there's a lot of preparations so I'm hoping to show you this step by step and the first step that I wanted to show you are the jars that they use these are just 16-ounce glass jars from you line.com l INE comm and they come with white metal lids which I'll show you in a little bit I used to use mason jars and as the company has evolved and my look had has changed I've changed to these 16-ounce glass jars which I'm really happy with they hold temperatures up to 900 degrees so you don't have to worry about your glass breaking under the heat or anything like that because that is a really high heat you're not going to be using for candles so I've been super pleased with these jars and then I am also using wicks from nature's candle supply and I let me go grab my paper so I can show you exactly which ones I'm using okay so the first thing I'm going to show you how to do is to lick your jars these wicks are CD 12 C D 12 wicks they are used for medium sized containers that have approximately three to three and a half inch diameter these are a little over three inches these are about three and a quarter in diameter so I find that the CD twelve wicks from nature's candles supply company work really really good for the wax and everything that I'm going to show you here that is something that's really important actually if you put the wrong sized wick in your candle it's either gonna burn too fast and smoke and it'll draw all the fragrance oil to the top of the candle and burn it out super quick if it's too small you won't get an even burn pool all the way across it'll just burn straight down and so that all affects the way that the candle smells and looks so do your research if you want a successful burning candle to your research on what type of wicks you're using with the type of wax that you're going to use and how large of the wick that you're going to use okay all that being said I'm going to show you how I glue these down I'm go ahead and move you up here so these are all my jars think the jars are not glued down yet I just have all the wicks sitting in there because that is the process today that I do I put all the wicks in and then I go through and I glue them down one by one this is the way that I've always done my wicks I just take my wig I use a little hot glue on the tab and these jars are pretty cool because they have a number on the bottom which is exactly the center so I just blew it straight into the center and then I take a popsicle step to push it down right now you take you through that process [Music] okay I'm back to talk a little bit about the method by which I melt my wax now I melt my wax in a roast pot a roasting pot the brand is presto and I really like it because it's got temperature controls the lowest one being 200 degrees which is exactly what I need to melt this particular wax down now today I'm gonna be melting down about 10 pounds of wax this container holds about 4 to 5 pounds of wax so I'm gonna have to do it in two batches which is okay by me but I wanted to show you how I do melt down my wax I do it in a roasting pot I can control the temperature a lot of things books other places are going to tell you to do it by double boiler method because the temperature will not get as hot and a double boiler method and if you're not doing a large quantity of candles you're only doing a couple candles a double boiler method works great and your wax won't get too hot but for my purposes since I used so much wax the roasting pot is a good option for me so I'm gonna go ahead and push this off to the side I have some wax in here already starting to melt I use joy wax from nature's garden candle it is my favorite my favorite wax I have tried lots of different waxes over the years this one is my absolute favorite it finishes perfectly fine it doesn't it adheres to the glass great it's a plant based wax they say on their website that it's a blend of soy vegetable paraffin waxes and it's very clean it just is the easiest wax in my opinion to use that I've ever tried ever so and I've used a lot of wax and wax just a note on that wax has come a really long way I first started making candles the first type of wax ain't ever but was in a wax kit that came from Joanne's or Michaels craft store and it was very very poor quality wax I do recommend if you're gonna get into candle making do not buy your wax from the your local craft store it's just not high-quality wax and I had all sorts of problems with it I couldn't get it to end here to the glass properly and on and on the list goes on it didn't throw the scent properly anyway after lots of trial and error I decided to go with soy based wax as a long time ago and then those were pretty good still had some problems with those as far as the tops of the candles getting modeled or cave in a little bit and then I came across the joy wax from nature's candles and I've got to tell you you guys it in my opinion it's the perfect wax for your hand poured candle people like it's so the quality is amazing the only downfall of this wax is you do have to cut it does not come in pellets or flakes for meeee like some of the other waxes that are kind of easier to scoop out and measure out and it's fairly this wax is fairly greasy but it's made for containers so that is something else that you're going to find the waxes are different types based on what type of candle you're making so if you're making a votive or the type of candle that sits and you know stand alone independently that you put in a mold and you pop out that is a much different wax you would not use a wax like joy wax for that this wax is specifically made for containers it's soft so it's got a lower milk point so make sure when you're purchasing your waxes that you know what your wax is good for and read read the manufacturer's description of the wax read the manufacturer's recommendations and directions that makes a huge difference I can't tell you how many times I just oh I know how to make candles and I'd go and I'd try do it using a wax maybe I used a lot of times before and I'll suddenly had a problem with it and couldn't figure out why then you go back and look at the directions and it's like oh you really do have to follow what they're saying it seems easy like melt it down cut it down melt it down get your fragrance get your color and your additives in and pour it in but really if you're not following those manufacturer directions on the wax you're gonna run into problems with performance so somebody takes a long time to put really good notes online for every wacko that you're able to purchase so make sure make sure you are looking at the directions and you know what type of wax you're binding and the joy wax is a blend I said of paraffin SOI vegetable waxes and they don't tell you the exact breakdown because this blend is proprietary to that particular company nature's garden but I love it I've compared this to 100% soy wax which that's what I was using kind of presents lilacs before before I started using the joy wax and I gotta tell you you guys this wax is thebomb.com so I'm gonna go ahead and yeah and I just think the only downfall if I had any critique at all is that it comes in a slab and you have to cut it instead of a lot of waxes come in pellet form or flake form and you just scoop it out and put it in but this is so worth it to me the wax performs and works so good that I only care like I would cut this blacks all day long that's how much I love it okay so we're gonna go ahead and fill the roasting pot we're gonna give that a few minutes to melt down and this wax this particular racks the joy wax needs to get to 200 degrees so we want to melt this down to 200 degrees again following the manufacturer's direction so I'm gonna go ahead and turn that from warm to 200 then we're just gonna let that melt down [Music] here to make sure that it's at 200 I use a digital thermometer and I also use this one for my soap temperatures when I do soap I think I picked this one up at Lowe's and it's so convenient I used to use an old candy thermometer when I very first started making candles and that is also effective if that's all you have around that this is super quick and easy so I just point it in there it gives me the little laser right into the middle of it and I have reached 200 degrees on this wax which is perfect so I am going to go ahead and turn my wax pot to warm and now it's time for me to weigh out my first five pounds of this wax so this is where it gets kind of tricky I like to use a lot of paper towel here case I spill I'm gonna go ahead and do that I have some down already over here but we're gonna go like this and then I use this big container you can get candle little pour pitchers from India soap and candle supply store they usually come in like a metal some sort of metal you used to use those a long time ago too I had one that lasted me a really long time that I got from a company that is no longer in business but because I'm doing so much I'm using this gallon sized container from webstaurant store webstaurant store's calm and I'm gonna go ahead and measure out my five pounds into this container so trying to get it close to my roasting pot here I'm gonna tear out my scale and then a Pyrex and I just go into the wax as slowly as I can because this is very full and just start taking out little bits at a time until I can we're gonna be pouring in five pounds I have weighed out my five pounds on to my scale and I'm gonna use my temperature gauge again to see where I'm at temperature-wise and it's at a hundred and eighty-three degrees now and this wax is awesome you add the fragrance into this wax between 175 and 170 degrees and let me tell you it is it's a relief like there's so many other waxes out there that you have to wait until it gets down to like a 120 degrees before you can pour and it's crazy so I'm gonna be using orange liquid candle dye from cear\u00e1 candles this is because I'm gonna be using the luscious fragrant oil called pumpkin apple butter also from nature's garden and this is where I got my wax pumpkin apple butter is a luscious luscious fall fragrance my absolute favorite for soap and candles this time that they here so I'm gonna be using the orange candle dyed a little bit goes a long way I have five pounds in here literally one drop per pound is all you need so that's what we're gonna do one two three four five now a little note on candle dye everything you add to the candle wax every added tip you add to the candle wax if you add any hardeners if you add any fragrance beeswax stearic acid fragrance and colorant those are kind of the typical things you would add I don't add anything to my candle wax except for fragrance and sometimes color most of the time I make white candles for the pumpkin apple butter I am going to be using the orange and as you can see it has died my my wax a perfect orange color this wax will not set up this dark so I like to use a white spatula when I'm stirring here because when I pull up the wax and then I can look at it against the white you show you what I mean by that that gives you a better idea of what color you're gonna end up with there you go but another thing you can do is just take a little bit of wax on your spoon put it out onto a white paper towel pour it out a little bit and it's gonna be a little bit darker than what's shown on the paper towel and it's gonna be a little bit lighter than what's shown in the picture so what I was going to tell you about adding fragrance and adding colorant is anything you add to your wax affects the performance of the candle the way that it burns so what that means is if I add in too much color and I don't follow the manufacturers directions I'm gonna wind out choking the wick on this candle so that means if I burn it I go to burn it it's gonna give me a very small flame flame and then eventually the wax will be so thick that it will just burn out the candle and and I'm telling you a little goes a long way if I don't follow the manufacturers directions on the color and I add too much I mean and just and it doesn't take a lot to go overboard so make sure again you're looking at all of those manufacturer directions before you do any pouring so you see the fragrance I'm gonna be using this is the color I'm gonna be using and we are sitting at 178 so while this is cooling down to 175 to 170 I'm gonna show you a little thing I like to use on my on my candles on my jars so once I have my Wixon this is cooling down to the temperature I need to add my fragrance into I like to wick use a wick clip on my candle wicks so that's what this looks like it's a wick clip it goes straight across the jar it clips the wick in place like so it holds it up straight when you pour and it keeps it centered so after you pour the wax your wick isn't gonna be floating to one side or the other it keeps it right in the middle super convenient super easy super cheap if you're gonna be making candles definitely invest in since some wick clips when I was using mason jars I will use the quick clips but I would also use paper clips not paper clips clothes pins because they fit across the jar perfectly and you could you could leave the wick right through that little hole and just set it down and it was Center these are too short for these jars maybe there's longer clothes pins out there but these ones that I have are too short so I do use the wick clips for this okay so while that's cooling I'm gonna go ahead and put my wig clips into my container into my jars here and just make sure that they're all prepped and ready to go [Music] my calculation for this particular recipe again you're gonna want to check in all your manufacturers directions this wax can hold quite a bit of fragrance oil which is another reason why I really like it this recipe is gonna hold an ounce and a half of fragrant oil per pound of wax so the other funny thing about these jars is it says 16-ounce jar maybe of this if you fill it all the way to the very very top but I always just fill it to that lip because the container needs a lid I don't want it to bother the wick after the lid goes on so actually it only holds 13 ounces of liquid so I kept I take my calculations into account there okay let me go ahead and check my temperature so if you just follow the ratio with this wax at a pound and a half I mean I'm sorry an ounce and a half of wax per a little boy I am tired and ounce and a half of fragrance oil per pound of wax and you should be fine that's what I do okay so we are sitting right at a hundred seventy two degrees which is perfect so I'm gonna go ahead and tear out my scale I'm getting my fragrance oil out my beautiful pumpkin apple butter you move this out of the way you can see that going in and I'm gonna weigh out my my fragrance now for this five pounds I'm gonna go ahead and put in eight ounces which is a half an ounce more over five pounds than the ratio I just gave you and I know that that ratio will work I've tested it out and the reason I'm doing that is because this is a sixteen ounce container and I want to make sure I use up all the fragrance oil between the ten pounds so that's seven that's eight ounces of fragrance oil per 5 pounds of which is a little bit higher of a ratio than I told you but not much Oh the overall effect will be the same and I've tested this lots of times that's the other thing you're gonna need to know regarding your product like you've got a test for everything so you're using something that you've never used before after you make your candle you want it to set up for three days three days then you test burn it if everything goes well and you're pleased with your product then it's ready to give away or sell okay there's my analysis I'm gonna go ahead and pull this off and then you stir and you give this about one full minute stir stir stir stir so this wax says that you pour at 165 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit so we were at 172 when I poured the fragrance oil in and so now I'm gonna go ahead and check my temperature and we're ready to pour were sitting at 162 degrees so I'm gonna move this over for a second so I can clean my workspace and I will bring you back in when I'm ready to pour in back the other thing I do here with my poor pitchers is I I go ahead and pour a smaller amount into this smaller container from Webster out store because I find it is super hard to pour evenly from this big container when it's so cold it sticks to the sides when you're pouring into the jars so I pour it to about here and then I set that one aside and now we are ready to stir alright let me just wipe down my work surface here a little bit it's a wax here okay it's not a big deal but you know you know how I am okay so we are now ready to pour so I'm gonna go ahead and try to bring you in a smidge closer so you can see what the heck I'm doing okay so here we are I hope that's good I'm gonna put that here I think right here I'll pour the force wouldn't first one here for you to show you this is my favorite part I love love pouring candles so you're gonna pour slowly and evenly as close to the wick as you can but not right over the top of the wick not too slow and not too fast [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that is the basic idea folks so what I'm gonna do is show you some finished pictures of how they look when they're all set up and then I'll show you what it looks like when it's all packaged with my special sunshine soap and candle company logo packaging and if you have any questions feel free to chime in ask me down in the comments box below and I hope you enjoyed this video and I will be showing you the finished pictures in just a minute hi everybody I'm back it's the next day and I'm here to show you how I trim the wicks on the candles and here's the little white lids I was telling you about yesterday and these are pretty nice because they have a little seal on the inside and they just look cute they're metal and white so I just go ahead and I've already done all of these I'm just gonna show you the one I just take the wick clip off like that and then I use Fiskars sewing scissors any sewing scissors work good these are like cotton core wicks and I find regular scissors don't work as well so I always use a sewing scissor when I'm going through here and I go down to about a quarter of an inch and I cut it off and then I just cap it and then a little note about my packaging and labeling so this is the label for the pumpkin apple butter candle all of my candle labels look the same they just have my social medias on the side my website the name of the candle and my logo and these labels are awesome they come from a store called online labels it's online labels calm and for this particular size for this 16-ounce jar I you can go in and put in your specs on what size label you want on online labels and they have so many options for for fairly expensive these are the inkjet labels so I can just print them off right at home it is the Oh L 9 3 5 0 CK for their clear gloss for inkjet so I can go ahead and print them right at home they are 2 and a half by 5 inches and they just fit this container perfectly so I'm going to show you how I label these these candles the little jars have a seam right here but I don't really look at that seam anymore I used to try to line it up at the scene but now I just kind of hold it with my fingers here Center it and then I just go like that with both hands and then there you have it there's your finished beautiful hair cord candle and it smells really good so go ahead and do one more for you and then that should be it and there you go okay everybody I hope you enjoyed the making of sunshine soap and candle companies candles if you liked this video please remember to Like subscribe comment share and
