love movies like that this is like yeah this is like really healthy as weed because it's like if you look at it it's not it's wall growing it's well flushed and everything and then the compare to a really heavy indica yeah take it out let's compare and contrast that this is an indica in here and see how it's all compressed and yeah that's what I'm saying look at that this is the your indica right here this is my indica we're not smoking this right now but it was here a little bit later look at that we got that so here [ __ ] smells good but yeah this right here everybody we got some yeah the Mendel breath that she's fired [ __ ] we got today we got ireia I did the real damn some live I'm gonna choose that eight if you don't mind me after [ __ ] was thirty-five bucks that was 30 bucks

five then we got this [ __ ] T you gets literally smelling it out of the container like you're just smelling it rocket almost literally like it reeks through the [ __ ] container I've been using this when there's we don't care how mad you house think is it oh damn that stink match sticky and I even break it down I literally just broke it just little pieces and I want to break the [ __ ] by hand now look at that you look at you look at closely like super super closely again this camera doesn't really do any justice but like if you look at it super close a [ __ ] is [ __ ] yeah that's just something bad so you know what you could do to grind it minimal yep do a couple just do a couple turns here let me show you how to everybody let me show you how sometimes like I think about it on my dude if you grinded if you grind the [ __ ] load out of it bro it could potentially take away some of the like trichomes engine you know anything a lot of people press down when they're grinding and like yeah you have to obviously present but like to a certain extent press down it only do like do one full turn another full turn another [ __ ] that's it that's it you need okay yeah that's really all you need you just kind of need them kind of like break down this little bear looking good yep was looking good nice fallin grinded and everything too so it's good I also today I'm the one that rolled it let me know how I did I'm usually not I'm not a roller definitely not a roller so it looks it looks nice from this side it doesn't mean he's good from far apart from good this side is likely what I'm gonna show you guys this a yeah a little ugly except for me I'm gonna taste that just takes to just take a hit and just taste that [ __ ] bro that girl that gluing on [ __ ] joke bro that guy was - yeah thank you yes make sure you acts nice impressing this oh you should have put a minute just a little oh [ __ ] no wait hold on I'm just thinking it's up to you but I'm just thinking on the bug I think now would have been at from the inside yeah yeah but no I was thinking I'll think I do that other container has a little layer like honestly with your Pig we could've just have my seat where's it now but my shits at the house let me check one of my things oh yeah so we slapped on some regard and well hold on you miss egg let a book all right yeah what is that some longer than what this is the the fire oh gee turns over whoo it's that one pass out that one book one book yeah that's just fire wrong oh let me see the right there oh nice yeah you're kind of just melting at huh yeah should it be warm yeah oh yeah huh yep even better yep there you go now it's getting more moist cheers gorilla glue with some OG fire wubba Oh some by someone the way that the og og well but no no no no let me rock rock introduce me man you introduced me to a new technique on how to spark it I knew it yeah whatever guys like this look you gotta make the usual somehow get into the facts how much cheese with that she's so [ __ ] loud you think about that first couple of heads bro what's up first couple hits I had a little bit of a stress on my mind my mother from whatever I had stressing from where our stressing banana just like kind of like weight the table my shoulders I'm just chilling I can just not worry about it and just be chilling and bright so what I'm trying to say is that I'm lit what was good though y'all have you guys ever smoked that gorilla glue what's poppin let me know in the comments down below makes you guys drop a comment there's no way guys a friend what you guys are smoking on mm-hmm but yeah this is some gorilla glue some Gigi number four so I'm really cool for so g-g-gee it's definitely paid like hella good like better or worse from your previous experiences hmm can't say just yet but I think this is good who knows actually because I know we had some guerrilla glue not so long ago honestly if you're right nut so that's what I'm trying to remember I was like you remember Johnny's guerilla game that's what I'm saying that shows fire to it look like an indica yeah and gorilla glue or also known as GG 4 created by Gorilla Glue stare decisis Evo dominant hybrid and multiple award-winning strain famous for its high THC content yup it a verge is 18 to 25 percent THC this one average is 22 this batch that we got 22% so with the imagine with the wax to this Pilate Helen oh yeah no [ __ ] regard and wax is looking like 50% but you may find it as high as 32% some dispensaries 32 some dispensaries have this [ __ ] at 30 to 30 when you get to 30 percent THC that is that's 5 [ __ ] right there that's that's fire yeah cuz the 30s that's why what the yeah yeah and then the CBD is very low ranging between a point zero five at a point one I honestly don't like I really don't like [ __ ] homes in CBD I don't like that should be giving me headaches in shape so let's see this is a 5 a 5 star out of 5 Gorilla Glue number 4 this is a really good strength and it's crazy too because the guy was like I asked him all that what do you recommend and he reached his hand on the back of something pulled some [ __ ] up and I was like GG floors I looked but he put his hand in a in a black pants and a black hole you just put that he just needs wet his pants and he's check out that [ __ ] and I was like Oh fire it's yeah I have two of those it's wait I don't get it so it says sativa but it's recommended to smoke at night interesting very interested if uhrin types of sativa yeah let's see in different types of engine typical typical effects relaxed card mouth sleepy common usage depression pain and insomnia okay that's kind of cool gorilla glue for us on itv4 was created this is that the strain gets his name because of the resin that collects on the scissors when trimming gorilla glue number four has several parents parents due to extensive background Sour Diesel sour dub cam sister at Kansas City Kansas and chocolate diesel the hybrid strain has won awards at the 2014 catalyst Cup in both LA and Michigan I usually don't cop that much unless I'm smoking like taking a nap described as a bunch of trichomes with a few but leaves in stocks sticking out the aroma is very strong true that and as most is mostly diesel with notes of chocolate and coffee although sweet and earthy is also it's also used to describe it you'll be going back for seconds due to the full-bodied and flavorful spot you mention it I do taste the chocolate milks in the smell is really [ __ ] nice I'm gonna lie this is gorilla glue this gorilla glue I'm not gonna lie it's Pollock in my top five best smelling weed flowers top five it's in my handful for sure not top five for me not me right now what I'm really on is all like the the oranges all the of the sours like the line technically yeah technically I try to choose I try to choose one of every category if that okay that makes sense yeah so out of like the ones that smell like these the gorilla greens like you said sour diesels and honestly cuz like Sardis let's just smells fire stuff too we really can sister [ __ ] and chocolate diesel I've never tried that sour dub neither so our diesel initially actually trying to a chocolate it's a strain called chocolate peppermint you remember that fan it's [ __ ] it tastes similar to this but [ __ ] now that I think about it I'm like Sour Diesel does [ __ ] smell like this too and I just gotta have both comparative we got to start doing versus versus yeah yeah like this versus this huh I'm Donna another hit 11 a campaign stepped out let's see the buds are green with orange hairs that's it is very oh it's spongy resinous and covered in trichomes it was yeah yeah the little dents what are the parts yet because it says it's this very dense spongy president then the trichomes you can see all that [ __ ] you really can't I really want to get a camera week the [ __ ] young man well imagine how high-quality are [ __ ] video get a microphone a microphone a freaking the colors the microscopes doesn't just end up looking at the [ __ ] well when our tree looks under my physical eyelids green that they know people have a bunch of like [ __ ] that in German and the little Tigers well you date that [ __ ] just marijuana a [ __ ] a cannabis plant looks really [ __ ] crazy then you zoom in and you see literally every little detail you see the trichomes are like little little crystals on there it's like it's like clear you know like orange hairs they're nuts like do this it's such a it's such a satisfying view like a whole nother filing Wow it's a home of the funny hobby like yeah that should say that [ __ ] has a lot of information though you know the glue is because it's really popular I know a lot of people like it with new [ __ ] a lot of people like been emoji to vent emoji remember the one that we smoked the vent emoji or do a send us upload that video curl igloo makes you chill medical and recreational users boat it gives a full body melt and despite the sativa dominance the body effect may be a result of the THC CBD ratio but let alone the copies a lawyer buddy if you guys ever smoked on some Gorilla Glue I know a lot of people out there it's kind of crazy bro this is what I really like about having this type of channel and having the type of community that I'm trying to get together you know it's like everyone's different parts of the world I have people commenting from the UK people from the East Coast and I'll shout to you guys try people from [ __ ] Antarctica but even from [ __ ] marty at what gods it Mars I don't know why I was hunting Bush out there but and you guys be smoking on like [ __ ] that I've never even heard of honestly people will drop a name or a strain or some [ __ ] and I'll just play what the [ __ ] I never heard about that I'll check it out yeah they did for sure I always say oh yeah I try this one we bro you don't have like if you guys are from California then we might have the same strength but you guys are from like somewhere else y'all have different strains like in London in a night like over there overseas do they have cookies like they should but that I'm pretty sure burn it would be smart enough to yeah setup with cookies club and in the UK especially London [ __ ] yeah oh yeah oh that's just legal out there hey Canada - mmm but maybe he already does have dispensaries in Canada and UK Glasson it's Canada cat in Canada that's just the legal legal that's just like you're smoking a cigarette you just have to be on personal property at urine which is the hostas personal property and you have to be of age we're both we're both 23 or 96 babies this is an 18 and up channel but it's all literally for all educational purposes I'm loaded with let us know if you guys are loaded and bloated with us learning gluten for sure I feel like I've been lettered in bullies inside that was 13 since eighth grade this is just like Lil D freshman year we started smoking it's crazy we should make a video on how I first started song in breath why we started smell good I'm there because we wanted to get our tolerance off for the under the influence we would have smoke sessions uh-huh and by his crib my house we would like kick in by like these offices because we are apartments are connected to like pretty much you can say abandon offices and [ __ ] so we just glad kind of walk to like the offices in shame and we just be like smoke and [ __ ] we smoke a [ __ ] blunt it's crazy back in the day everybody loot all it would be like six of us and we don't opt like two dollars and fifty cents each literally two dollars to fifty cents these food walk the shell end up then and we're all like 16 17 and no no we were younger yeah we were younger and the guy the guy that used to work but at the gas station that we used to go this guy he would let us buy [ __ ] like Swisher's and [ __ ] he just wanted to make sells you know so he's like [ __ ] which works for us and yeah yeah exactly and I'm pretty sure bro we all like tell a little to the video server to keep making dropping videos like that bro that [ __ ] I should have a funny bro [ __ ] that's just really crazy bro we don't drop $2.50 clothes if you go to the gas station get changed and by a blunt go to the walk walk see if we can get a ride to the plug house and so now we would walk or it was an adventure yeah it wasn't that far the plug look over the bridge for the bridge yeah cop like a good like a 10 sack or a 1.5 roll that [ __ ] in a blunt maybe two maybe like [ __ ] split that point what point eight point eight in the black yeah yeah well I think gave us dub we just rolled both blunts mm-hmm and we just smoked one both of them and we'd just be chilling and I just having hella fun like six seven of us is hella loaded just not going on adventures don't have a fun [ __ ] we'd be stupid loaded and out of the consume but a display survivor like you know that was live yeah one time we had these like these guys dressed up as girls chases yeah right and we like we really we were young [ __ ] 15 so just imagine and we were this is like this is like a 25 2012 2013 yeah yeah yeah you're right we're little well technically we're like when I brought what the [ __ ] we saw like these guys in like dresses put with makeup and hair case abroad so that [ __ ] was like awesome well and that was a time we're like [ __ ] tap-dancing bunny you're like two three years I never ran that fast do life went out

stoned [Music] [Applause] [Music] here we go [Music] you that's okay man that's pretty good so let's talk about it gorilla glue number four also known as gg4 because of the whole lawsuit thing uh it is pretty high in thc 84.64 cbd content is 0.14 percent and let me tell you man it is tasty this is a virgin rosin butter um it's very very smooth consistency of as you can tell from the pictures has a nice light creamy color to it the taste is very very strong in the limonene the beta mercin and also the beta kerry falling if any of you guys can pronounce them better i'm sure anyways you go ahead and correct me in the comments down below i know you know better but anyways let's get down to it so it's got this real lemony citrusy taste but it's also sweet on the exhale which is kind of unique [Music] the lineage is believed to be ken sister crossed with sour dub crossed with chocolate diesel gorilla glue has won multiple high times awards it is a very very well known strain that gets crossed with just about everything on you know it's it's everywhere i mean it's kind of surprising if you haven't tried gorilla glue put down in 2020 and you're a soldier it's very piney citrusy sweet it comes from like pure sifted trichomes they make the verger rosin butter by taking all the trichomes off the bug sifting it down and then pressing it into the actual uh extract using a solvent-less press you know like a heat press this particular strain i got for 50 bucks at very life in illinois and i think it's a pretty good deal bang for your buck the only negatives is you know when when strains started getting cross and crossed and crossed they started losing their thc content and started gaining a lot more higher thca content and this is one of those strains where it doesn't really knock you out if anything it makes you a little bit more energetic gets you talking gets you a little bit creative and ready to go and that's good and bad for some people you know depending on what you want out of the strain at high doses it is pretty sedative but you gotta smoke man you gotta take down a lot to be actually feeling sedated honestly this is the strain i use when i wanna draw or go design something or if i got an idea for a cool you know design that's when i'll be smoking this personally i love gorilla glue i like gorilla glue the original number four just like this over all the crosses of gorilla glue i think it'll i feel like it's just starts losing its flavor and it's distinct taste once you start mixing it into like wedding cake and lava cake with all that other stuff so my personal rating one through ten for guerilla blue number four is going to be a 7.8 out of 10. i'm pretty happy with it for 50 dollars it's a good bang for your buck it won't get you the highest there's definitely stronger strains and more thc specifically heavy strains that will get you feeling like gone but for a like creative daytime kind of smoke this is your strain all right man this has been wojie thanks for watching thanks for smoking along with me and i hope you're smoking with me on the next video", "erjEHvnEl8c": "if you are not 18 click off the vid I click off money get like I

episode of waking bait inc this morning we got a new strand for you it's not really a new strand but it is a old strand i done it about a year ago but this here is about this is gorilla glue number four gorilla glue number four look at that let's see if i can get a clear shot of it there we go gorilla glue number four this is also sponsored by this cannabis is also sponsored by smokey thrax he's

page and i'll give him uh a follow too go ahead subscribe to him anyway i've done this about a year ago you guys don't you guys know what gorilla glue smells like this is gorilla glue number four the famous one and it is tasty yet delicious believe that so i don't know if this one's tasty or delicious because i haven't had it yet but we're gonna check them out and i do i do really love a clean bone you can see the weed in the bowl and everything see this is why i don't put my bone my my glass in a plastic bag and shake it up because this little flimsy part right here i don't want to break that off it's not really that flimsy but i just want to break my bone i'm sure you guys understand here we go clean bone let's get in gorilla glue number four [Music] i forgot how it feels to get out of a clear bone [Music] there's no resin obstructing it at all so the smoke is definitely just coming straight through but it is tasty and delicious you guys know that sweet taste of gorilla glue oh this is beautiful let's go ahead and get my air straight wow that was the first hit i'm sweating already tasty yet delicious i didn't show you guys how it looked on a breakdown even when i broke it open there's a little piece of the break open it's not gonna do it there it is sorry guys all the trichomes coming up there sorry guys i think that increases my heart too we so no no new conspiracy theories today they're all pretty much the same the only one that i wanted to touch on that really tricks me out is i still i still think about donald trump admitting that there's aliens he's been to blow the whistle on everything if they get him out of office he's fitting to tell everything about the government maybe this is how we learned everything about them because y'all know the government is nothing but a bunch of shady people man i wouldn't be surprised if it was run by the mafia i don't even think the mafia is as shady as the government okay that is a beautiful flavor for some reason it's got an undertone of berries to it that's weird it can't be because the bowl's dirty but that's a weird taste of gorilla glue but i know it's gorilla glue number four because i can taste the gorilla glueness on it it's quite tasty and delicious whoo if i get my breath straight then i can do the video okay i do love a clean bong so you guys think i should rinse it out every time i use it like after i use it for this video i should rent it out i think that's what i'm start doing because this really did i mean i could taste everything feels like i could even taste the [ __ ] glass [ __ ] [Music] maybe i shouldn't try and roll it in all right i haven't told you guys in a while how much i truly appreciate you guys and thank you so much for the comments pertaining to cleaning my bong i did listen to all of them um but for the way i cleaned my bong is i don't know i guess i've gotten used to it it may be easier the way you guys are talking about it because if you put it in a plastic bag and put the alcohol in there and shake it up it gets all through it you know through the whole thing so perhaps next time i'll try that you know i wasn't trying to diss anybody by saying oh you guys idea sucks about putting it in a plastic bag and shaking it i wasn't saying that it was just that i'm really paranoid about breaking my my glass piece i really am i try to preserve my glass and be as careful as i can with it at all times sometimes you get a little slip up oh you know your [ __ ] fall or something like the last bone that i had if you go back and look at the old videos the last bong i had it was kind of a round one it was a really nice one man but i remember i was walking in the kitchen just take the bottom of it like that on the wall just about that hard and the whole bottom dropped out but i was like are you serious that's why i got this kind of beaker style thick glass y'all here i think that [ __ ] is i kind of feel like i could drop this on the ground and it wouldn't break but i'm sure what i'm just saying that's how thick it is feels really really solid that's why i like this bone but it is about time to bring a new one to the channel this has been on the channel for a while that glue taste is just to die for you guys know how how partial i am to the glues gorilla glues the cakes and all the variations of them now the cakes there's some variations of cakes that i didn't like like the um the glue cakes i really wasn't too much of a fan of that even though it's two of one of my two of my favorite strands it is the gorilla glue in a wedding cake it just didn't it wasn't a cool mix every strand doesn't mix well with other strands you know it's like there's some strands that don't mix well together and i believe that that is one of them but this gorilla glue is just really sweet and delicious tasting this isn't even dispensably great but it's really good i'm sorry you guys for the last what three videos i've been having like asthma attacks in the morning like i'm having an asthma attack right now but but we're gonna rush through it and we're gonna keep smoking i think that's why i'm taking little hits but anyway on a scale of one to ten one being that [ __ ] ten being that good [ __ ] of the flavor critique of this gorilla glue number four non-dispensary grade we are going to give this a i think we're gonna give it a seven because although it's gorilla glue and i'm getting pretty big i feel it right across here although it's gorilla glue and i really do love gorilla glue it tastes like last year's but like it tastes like it's like it's lacking some of the flavor like you know gorilla glue tastes hot pops this is not really popping i could taste the gorilla glue but it's like a hint of it and i'm getting really big i have a slight burn in the middle back part of my throat in the middle back um it leaves a really good taste in your mouth not no dry taste in your mouth the expansion rate on my lungs i can't really give you an expansion rate on it because like i said i'm experiencing an asthma attack so the expansion rate is going to be quick for me anyway so um yeah i think i think the seven is good for it anyway it's really i guess it's good because i love the gorilla glues anyway anyway let's keep going and get to the high critique what i recommend is gorilla glue to my friends absolutely man you guys already know how gorilla glue is everybody knows how gorilla glue tastes if you haven't tasted gorilla glue yet then you've been living under a rock word oh it feels like my lungs just cleared up a little it's weird because you can feel it feels like it just opened up like okay that's why there was no cough involved in that one i hope you guys are having a good a good morning so far so you can best believe that i really do believe that they're they're going to shut the country down when biden takes office what is that january 20th but it sounds like to me when they're talking about shutting the country down this time they're not talking about like like oh just stay in your house but you can come out and do certain things they're talking about stay the [ __ ] in your house man like like they don't even come out in your yard don't even go to the stores they're talking about stay in your house and it's like nah y'all y'all are doing something crazy to make us to make us have to stay in the house because this corona virus the common flu has more fatalities than the than this corona bars they've been padding a number since the beginning been [ __ ] giving you jacked up numbers since the beginning so they could all get to this point of the lockdown and buying this part of it you know they had their little pawn set in place trump did his little [ __ ] and they kept him in there but what they didn't know about trump is that [ __ ] want he's going to want to stay in there and he's going to fight to not go see i didn't know that about him they also didn't know how how mentally challenged he was they didn't realize all this so this is why he buy him on this one because you know they were like trump won again because [ __ ] he does anything they tell him to do so this is why buying one but biden is gonna be the one to shut the country down watch it's gonna be crazy as [ __ ] man but i'm gonna tell you what man i'm not staying in house [ __ ] y'all can't lock us all up but i don't want to be the first one either [Music] yesterday i was walking around looking like one of those [ __ ] little dinosaurs with at the short arms because like i told you i worked out and that was the first time that i've been to the gym and like the first time i've worked out in the gym in like three months my arm right here swollen i can feel it it just doesn't feel normal it feels like it's swollen like it's damage swollen it's weird because this as far as i can stretch my arms out before they start hurting see what's here to hear is really painful i can't lift my arms up with this eye because my my lats right here are swollen i can feel them they're swollen it's crazy they've never felt poked out like that before so maybe that time away from the gym did help me out metaphysically or you know as far as body structure goes because if i go to the gym again today i can't work on no upper body man problem is that but i don't want to have my legs like that either you guys ever done leg day did like not the next day after late day but the day after that is when it starts hurting i'm getting a really good buzz right now it started out right here but now it's behind my eyes and uh yes it's definitely gorilla glue even though it doesn't taste all the way like it i recognize the heart it's just that this isn't this blood wasn't grown in california and plus his lashes but when you've been smoking butt as long as me you can start you can start tasting the origins of where certain buds come from or you can start tasting the it's weird to say you guys but you can start tasting the elevation like if it was if it was grown like in let's say uh colorado colorado the higher the elevation i guess if it's above a mile then it has a kind of a watered-down taste it's still good bud but it's kind of watered down to me so when it's a lower elevation in a warmer climate with more humidity than it tastes like california but to me gives me that sweet just delicious taste you know i've had washington dc wheat i've had main weed you know brunswick maine weed not brought to me but just mainly know it all tastes different it's all different because of the elevation because of the humidity in the air because of the soil uh because of of the way that your property is situated you know like if your the patch is in front of the house you know like the sun may hit it this way or may hit it that way it's a whole bunch of different things man you start to taste all those flavors like i told you guys i've been smoking since i was eight years old and i'm 45 i wish i was 45 huh i'm playing i've been smoking cells eight year old eight years old you guys and i'm 54. that's crazy that is crazy i've been smoking a long ass time of course there was breaks in between like like like when i got sick like when i was in a hospital for a couple days or you know there's been times like that when i was locked up or something but i smoked a lot of weed when i was locked up that is tasty so this is the second time that i've critiqued um gorilla glue but i don't i believe that the last whirl of glove did was a year ago and it was uh just gorilla glue this is gorilla glue number four i don't know the difference between why they give us the numbers but i'll tell you one thing i am getting really baked pretty hard right now and this does this is not a ceiling but it's like i'm steadily going up and up and getting higher and higher it's crazy now if i remember i hope to remember to rinse this out as soon as i get done but see i'll be too busy trying to post a video when i get done that i forget about everything else i'm just posting the video i just want to get the video to y'all no i'm saying no i mean i do feel it feels funny man you guys because my arm isn't this thick man it feels like you know when you lift how you get that pump that's what it feels like it feels like i got a pump and i haven't even lifted today that's crazy and you can see i don't know if you can see it but it's swollen right there it's usually a sharper like that boy maybe that's what i needed was a little break ouch uh i don't know see if we can work something out today you know that you're when you tear your muscle because that's what this is a torn muscle when you tear your muscle you're not supposed to work that muscle out again for at least six to six days to a week so i know that i don't do curls until monday anyway so i'm good until monday i'm still gonna work it out to watch sorry y'all talk about working out i get excited about working out because i'm trying to be the best version of me i can be [Music] okay let's pack a little bit more since we only have a little bit more and let's talk about other things so so what do you guys think is gonna happen oh uh what did i hear yesterday the day before that somebody had asked trump what he would do in the event of an alien uh invasion and trump said they don't understand the might of the us military and i was like oh they trump you gotta be you gotta be [ __ ] me man because for we don't really know much about aliens only the government knows about them because they don't want to deal with them so but if they can get from where they're at to here then it means they have better technology than we do that means they're smarter than we are or they have more resources than we do which means that they probably got they probably got something that could blow up a [ __ ] planet and we're talking about and trump's talking about oh yeah they don't understand the might of the us military every time the military has fought the aliens in the movies the muffin aliens was beating our asses but we had to make it look like we would win but you know they was kicking our asses man it's like why do they why do we always think that aliens are coming here to fight us to kill us too maybe they want our resources i don't know maybe they know something that we don't know that's the whole problem maybe that's why they make movies like that to prepare us love that i had a glitch one being that [ __ ] didn't be like good [ __ ] well the high fatigue of this gorilla glue god we're going to give it a i'm pretty high i have to give this a nine yeah i'm gonna give it a nine because i'm pretty high you guys so we gave it a seven for the flavor and a nine for the hot it's a pretty big difference but it's really good and i'm pretty high you know somebody else in another room golfing they're in there smoking too so anyway ouch i really appreciate you guys thanks for stopping by i love it when you guys come by my crib man don't you guys love me when i stop by your crib so i hope you guys have a beautiful blessed awesome legendary day let's do it again today y'all want to do one random act of kindness for one person give a give a homeless person or less fortunate person some money uh give somebody some directions pay for somebody's gas just one random act of kindness y'all try it and see if we can eradicate this homelessness and [ __ ] you know what i'm saying make people feel better about themselves you know so um i hope you guys have a truly legendary awesome day man y'all be blessed and please stay drama free you also got to go home but you got to get the hell out of here you already know what i'ma say stay baked", "-JDaTZG7cTc": "bill coming back at you with another video today we're gonna be training this monster gorilla glue number four photo period and getting it ready for flower for real this time okay guys so a little back story about this gorilla glue number four I got it from a friend that got it from his brother now it was already he had already flipped it to flower so it was just starting to starting to flower and he took a couple clones off it stuck them in Solo cups and they revenged and started to grow so I got one of those and once it had totally revenged I transplanted into a seven gallon fabric pot which it's in now so that was October 15th which is what is that it's like two and a half months so I hadn't planned on letting it go this long I had actually did a video but six weeks ago where I had taken her and using the Swazi technique stripped her up all the way put her in the bedroom closet which is where I was going to grow her and my plan was to flip the lights and flip her to flower but it didn't work out that way and now it here it is six weeks later and she's massive which is not a bad thing but I have a very small little house here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try to train her down a bit and find a place for her to grow and then flip her so let's take a closer look at it okay guys so here she is sitting smack-dab in the middle of my living room and there's a couple of 5-gallon buckets there's my curing buckets and just to give you a size reference there's my couch so anyway she is huge she is probably well not probably I actually measured it she's both three and a half feet wide in diameter pretty much all the way around and she's about four feet high from the floor I do have a piece of styrofoam underneath the fur because I am on carpet in here and the floor is not insulated very well here at all so that gives her a little bit of gets her off the floor a little bit so I don't freeze her roots but anyway she's in the seven gallon pot and she's very healthy doing very well but you can see I I did no training to her as far as any LSD or super cropping or anything this is all natural being a super crop clone she they put out stems everywhere so that's what gives her this structure so I had lollipop there a little bit there six weeks ago when ice was schwoz'd her but yeah she's grown back a little bit I mean she is just wow she is so full so bushy it's gonna take quite a long time to clean this up but that's what we're gonna do today so I think what else do right now is I'll just put you on the tripod and then explain what we're gonna be doing to her okay guys so we have to clean this girl up really well if we flipped us the way it is it's just gonna be a bunch of a lot of small colas and a bunch of larf down underneath and all that so what we're gonna do is we want to focus the energy of this plant in the only top bud so I'm gonna use some techniques that I learned from Kyle kushman on on YouTube check him out very smart dude I've watched a few of his videos and I'm gonna take some of his techniques and incorporate it into this - this girl here so okay so I already did a couple of branches on the other side but I forgot to turn the camera on I'm really bad at that if I move the camera and I pause it I forget to turn it on so anyway I flipped it all the way around the plant and we're gonna start again and work our way around okay so again we're gonna clean it at the bottom here the obvious stuff anything that doesn't I'm up to about 50% the height of the plant is coming off so we have we have lots of stuff here beautiful clown material okay so I'm gonna bring you in closer here for this so you can see exactly what I'm doing okay I hope I set that right so what we're going to do is we have this nice beautiful branch here and we have all these side branches coming off it what we're going to do is we're gonna cut off every one of those side branches except for the very top so let's do that and we're gonna leave the leaves for now I hope you can see what I'm doing here ever at every node there's a leaf and then there's a branch that's coming out this one I must have already taken the leaf off earlier so that's fine take off every side branch right up to the top we'll take this one this one I'm I'm not gonna lie this is making me a little nervous because I've never gone that high with it and basically that's that's just leaving us with actually I'm gonna take this one here also all that's leaving us with just a couple little nodes here but I missed a big one here so this complete branch is stripped of side branches and suckers now I'm gonna flip the lights in a few days and this is going to grow this even though it's four feet high it's gonna be six feet high by the time it's done so we'll have two more feet of growth coming off of this one spot so even though we've trimmed everything below that would have all been larf anyway so now it's just gonna take all the energy that it would have given to every one of those side branches all that energy is going to keep going right by that and go into this very top piece here so it's gonna accelerate growth we should get like a massive burst of energy once we flip and then even after we flip and this grows another two feet 18 inches two feet at that point we're gonna have to come back and we're will be taking off we'll be cutting these new little fresh nodes in another week or two they're gonna be those big side branches that we just cut off and we'll probably end up cutting off and work working our way up again so and then we'll just have all main top coal a premium bud without any of the larf down below so and also at that point we'll be taking off these leaves too so because these leaves will be way under the canopy now we have some really nice side branches here we're gonna take it right off yeah there we go we got that one nice trip there so now I think what I'll do is I'll just put on some music for you guys and I'm just going to go around and clean it out and we'll come back and talk about it when I'm done [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys so we got this part of the training done and another part that I'm gonna use from Kyle kushman is the chiropractic part where he breaks the inner stem the inner part of the stem to increase the flow of nutrient up from the from the roots to the tips so how he does this now I've seen him do it I haven't never done it myself so this is my first time too I really hope I don't screw this up on camera but if I do I do so what he does is he goes right to the base of his plant I'm not going to go right to the base because you're that's thick that's a tree there there's no way you're gonna be able to twist that enough to make it work but so I'll come up where it starts to get a little thinner and what he does is he grabs ahold of it let me see if I can bring you in here okay so so he comes in you grab it you secure it with one hand and then with the other hand you grab ahold of it and you twist until you hear crack let's see if we can do this okay now I it was very muffled but you could feel it broke inside so and then you go up you grab a boat an inch higher and you twist it the other way again I could heat I could feel it give inside so I'm not going to go any further and another inch back the other way okay and there I did hear that crack I don't know you could probably not hear it but so basically what it's doing is it's breaking that the inner cell now so a lot of us when we cut our plants down you'll see that the inside is sometimes hollow now I've been told that's a good thing I've been told it's a bad thing about Kyle kushman explains it pretty good the plant doesn't take up nutrients through that like a straw that hollow part it takes it the nutrients off between cells on the outside of that hollow part so basically what we're doing when we're twisting that is we were creating a superhighway where we're making more of that cell that cellular area for the nutrients to come up so they can they can travel much easier through that so that he does that for every branch so I'm gonna go I'm gonna try this again and see if we can hear it this time so we're gonna go right down to the base there I can feel it yeah but they're here to crack their crack their crack their crack there there and there and and so we've cracked the inside all the way up didn't hurt the lamb the limb still seems strong enough to hold itself up so I'm gonna go through and I'm gonna do it to each each branch from where I know I can twist it snap snap snap snap okay okay guys so I'm not sure if I got all of them but I got the majority of them so doesn't seem to have hurt the plants at all they still have structural integrity they're not falling over so and so and while doing it some branches were actually quite quite audible to crack some of them not so much and some of the stop down below just it was too strong to even twist so anyway so that's supposed to help out with the with the nutrient uptake and also it also makes the stem as much stronger kind of like when you break your leg when you break your leg in a spot it will calcify as it heals and you'll never break your leg in that spot again because it's so much stronger than what it was I'm not saying you can't break your leg above it or below that spot but you'll never break your leg in that spot again so it kind of works the same way with this when you're breaking that that cell membrane and it heals back together it creates a much stronger area that will make your stems nice and strong and rigid so okay guys so definitely cleaned your up quite a bit still tons of top nodes here now people might think that I hurt yield by taking off all those branches this is law check this out that is a ton of material taken out of that girl so yeah by taking all that out what we did was we basically just concentrated all the the energy that this girl is going to have is going to be all put up into these top buds so so that's it for that one so be sure to check out Kyle Cushman's chiropractic training method that's what I used on this and I I hope I did it justice but it seems to look pretty good to me some of it was a little bit scary to do for the first time but it all seems to make sense to me and yeah so we'll come back now how big is it now let's see okay you guys aren't gonna be able to see this but I'm just kind of eyeballing it let's go to the edge there so we have it look we'll go there stay here so we're right around three inches so we leave at three feet sorry so we've actually taken off about six inches in diameter off the plant and so which gives me an idea now I think what I'm gonna do I'm not sure don't quote me on this is I might bring out shorty from the three by three and bring her out here and put the Myers hydro over top of her and let her finish up out here which is not optimal because there's no reflective area out here so but then I'll take this girl and try to move her into the 3x3 because I need an area where I can have complete darkness for 12 hours and if I do it out here I don't have another tent so I would have to rig up something to to completely put her in darkness so maybe we'll do that maybe we won't we'll find out next time and I hope you enjoyed this video if you did you can give me a thumbs up if you like hit

growing the guerrilla blue number four and we're looking really good here just it's a collation today so you get light on those smaller pots and get everything filled out nicely you guys just tuning in and this is your first time watching we got hit eat 50 gorilla glue number 4 plants in here from seed it's a 4 by 8 broken and they're in two gallon pots we're using some LED lights from Amazon Aglets 2000 watt equivalent lights and nothing special just got some fans to lose the air around in here and here when the lights are off and it's cold air out tape they're in the snow and [Music] gets too high all in all when you can really get at week five flower we did two weeks of bench so seven weeks total so far we have about two or three weeks of flower left until these finish out but the tent is just built or in a corner you're not some new nice button so the AdWords not let's see how think these once again any questions going them into gallon fabric Watts using a peat moss and soil but the nice big step", "5MIUEUFjpyA": "hey guys bill back at you with another video and today we're going to be getting this gorilla glue number four monster crop clone ready for flower okay guys so we're gonna be taking a look at this gorilla glue number four monster crop and see what we're gonna do here to get it ready for flower okay so there she is she spent the last little while in my tents but it was getting pretty crowded in there so it's time for her to go to her forever home and flip the lights and let's get this baby flowering so what makes this a monster crop well let's take a look down below here it should answer some questions for us okay so there she is well what this was was it was a little bud from a mother plant clipped off a little bud stuck her in some ground and cloned it so what happens is it it takes root and you flip the lights from 12/12 back on to the veg cycle she went right into 24-hour light with my autos and she revenged back into the vegetative stage and took off so what happens now with these guys is they grow a little bit different they're not symmetrical like your your regular cannabis plants but they grow in all directions you can see like great from the base or coming out everywhere which makes it very very bushy so this is typical of your your monster croc clones which can have really nice yields because of just how bushy they get so let's take a look in here now you can you can see to the the way these grow it's not your depth goal top node and then it splits off into two and then continues growing splits two more stems off these almost topped themselves you can see there's a couple spots in here see here where it just looks like they've been topped over and over again where I haven't even touched this girl yet this isn't really my first time getting in here looking at her so they just grow very sporadic and come out in all directions so what we're gonna do today is we're going to we're going to clean up this bottom clean that up so we get all this stuff off the ground trim off any little stuff here that isn't going to produce anything like some of these suckers here we don't need the plant putting energy into something that is not going to grow us some big buds so that's what we'll be doing today and then I think - I think I might use the swatting technique on this which is basically where you strip the plant entirely of its leaves except for just a couple at the very tops you want to leave those but everything else pretty much comes off so I'm gonna try that and see how it turns out I've done the swatting technique before on photo periods and Otto flowers and have had pretty good success with it so this is so bushy I really want to just open it up and let that light down there while she flips so when she's stretching than some of this some of these lower buds here have a chance to grow up to catch up and hopefully we get a nice wide canopy and go from there okay so I think we're just I'll just put you on the tripod guys and just get in here and get at it okay so the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to get in here with our little Clippers and we're just going to start cleaning out some of this just lower stuff some of these suckers all these little little leaves so none of this stuff is really serving any practical purpose down here so we're just gonna clean it out turn it around here see if we can get in from this side okay [Music] okay so we got that cleaned up over there pretty good okay so the next thing we're going to do is I'm going to take a bamboo piece of bamboo and I'm going to shove it right down the center here just to give us something to tie stuff up to once it gets a little bigger and a little heavier so I'm just going to gently push it down okay we're hitting the root break there and I don't want to hurt that so we'll just move it off a little bit more there okay so though that just gives us something to tie stop up to and I'm gonna start off right now with tying that main stem up just did secure it a little bit so we'll get right down in here with pipe cleaner just wrap that around a few times and that just keeps it from wanting to move too much so now later on as these grow this will give us a base here that we can just tie this up to here if it gets heavy so it keeps it from falling down all right let's take a look at this leaf here this is your typical leaf for if you revenge a plant you'll get a lot of single fingered leaves like that perfectly normal once they get through that stage then they'll then they'll start growing more fingers so this is about OneNote up and now we got the triple fingered leaf and then up just a little bit higher now we're up to the fives and then you can see up here you got one two three four five six seven eight nine so you got it search to go back it just slowly revenge's and goes back into growing its leaves over so we're going to strip this off pretty good so I'm just going to get at it we'll set some music up here for you guys and I'm just going to prune away [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys so there she is she went from Bush to a skeleton and we can see here there are still some leaves at the very top each each top of a bud site I left at least one or two well pretty much - two leaves here the key photosynthesis going but we cleared out everything below so almost everything so now what this is going to do is it's going to put all of its energy in to grow on these buds I'm going to put some more air movement on they're picking up them these little little stems are not much to them right yet so we're gonna put some air movement on there strengthen them up I do have some silica that I will probably give her a couple of doses of that and that also will help to strengthen up all them stems and we'll stick her in the closet and we'll come back in a week or so and take a look at it then now I've been feeding this girl bloom nutrients the same as I have with my Otto flowers right from the beginning so that has seems to have enough nitrogen in it pushed out pretty good through veg so I'll probably just continue to give her that and I'll also give her a little bit of silica and that should help thicken them stems out and strengthen them up so and then we'll come back next week and take a look at and see how she's doing at that point okay guys that's it for this one let me know down in the comments what you think of this technique have you seen it before have you used it before what are the

bottom and the reason for that is because today I'm basically just going to explain my defoliation methods my thought process on it explain how I do it and why so basically you know a lot of people have the idea that you should do it in phases right and there's other people that don't do it at all and then there's people that do it little by little right and what I like to do is the here a little by little and the phases approach basically because depending on how much you take off the plants and when you do it you're shocking them basically every time that you do what you're going to shock them a little bit to an extent and depending on what stage of growth are in and how you do it you're going to shock them and it specifically and their response will be you know a specific response so that's why a lot of times if you do it in early veg it'll stump the plants you shock them in early veg and that's just a response if you do it you at late veg and you do it properly you're not gonna talk that much but you're gonna focus growth elsewhere and you're going to expose a lot more bud signs right if you do it kind of after the first you know a couple weeks of flower you're going to promote them to just focus more on flower production because once they're flowering they're they're pretty much defense mechanism is to produce trichomes and flowers because that's how they keep animals off right so that's why we want to intentionally shock them sometimes and that's why people had certain boosts to them right because everything is a stress on them super cropping things of that nature topping all of these things are stressed techniques that we use to provoke the plant to do a specific response so what I like to do is the foliate you know right before I flip a little bit kind of do the whole lollipop thing but not you know not so much like most growers do I don't do it at fit on you guys you could sell and then what I do is after I get some good flowers produced by the week beginning of week you know two or not beginning week like mid week to the beginning of week three I'll go ahead and pull a lot of those upper fan leaves that are really large and already you know but sites forum doesn't necessarily need that fan leaf and it's blocking a lot of the bud sites below I'll go ahead and remove those as well as follow up by going down below and moving a lot of those secondary fan leaves that are in the middle of the canopy that are blocking a shit-ton as well and then finally at the very bottom I'll cut off some of the stuff that I know is just not gonna produce anything worthwhile at all this grow I didn't really do that as much because I plan on removing a lot more sand leaves this time rather than the bottom nugs because I'd rather have those bottom nugs for squishing and then not have them at all so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go through here and give you guys another top view real quick over here on this blue side but I'm gonna go through here and do some defoliation like I talked about removing some of these larger families that are up at the top that aren't necessarily needed and they're blocking a lot down below it and then even more so down there deep in the canopy like that leaf could go and it's blocking quite a few things so okay a lot more light penetration when all said and done and a lot larger bud size all the way down through the canopy we'll be back we are back about I don't know maybe in our two hours I don't know I lose track of time when I get in here working but as you can see it's been cleared out quite a bit I pulled a three gallon pots worth of leaves out of there and then some of these things they're just so [ __ ] frosty that one wasn't really that frosty with man I'm a little smaller one got a little bit closer into the boats just super super frosty [Music] anyways see already there's difference that makes and I haven't even really gone through the bottom to cut anything off the bottom yet I just went through and took majority of the families from the top so get in here you can kind of see those it's better now [Music] [Music] [Music] a [ __ ] bomb get up here on the stool and give you guys a little bit better than you his name's as [Music] it's not [Music] take [Music] and then over here on the blue [Music] decent work in here colas are great law [Music] Buffett Gillick guerilla has and I did this technique called back budding on some of the jobs getting too close to the light and we just sniff like a half inch off the top and it'll force the bud start growing outwards and stop growing animals [Music] there we go [Music] blues look on points as well [Music] to to the other side of the tent [Music] you see on this side [Music] all these lower buds that are way in the back are now gonna have a chance growing up being nice big buds [Music] that's you [Music] [Music] and I didn't get every little fan leaf out and I even miss some big ones but that's okay a little bit at a time come back and do more try not to fall over here as I get these shots for you guys I like being halfway inside the tip here [Music] [Music] that's probably the worst one just been so closed all night but it's alright so that's that keep an eye on it and come back in and just see little by little 24 hours after the first video [Music] creating up a lot earlier they ran two lights you can get a water problem tomorrow same thing with the glue just definitely greened up to the little bit about too too much more and any big difference is here in BTY of g which usually is drooly looking very sad and it's already getting greener and praying to the light that's good so these are just gonna continue to get better over the next couple of days we'll probably mix up some more and give them a couple more feedings over the next couple day with that spray and keep you guys posted and let you know [Music]", "6-qXy-MVgh8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another bear laps cartridge video you know saying we got the gorilla glue 4 i actually went to the club thinking i was able to get another lemon sorbet but it sold out quick and i was just kind of like sitting there thinking about what cartridges again i was just like well let me just try another gorilla glue but i was kind of like iffy about that because if you didn't see my video already with the other bear labs video that i did randy got the strawberry cheesecake and it wasn't that great it wasn't it was a cartridge that i probably wouldn't even buy so it kind of was just like oh there's like a 50 50 chance that this might be bad as well so i don't know i got it anyways we're gonna see but i did get some boba as well so let's just [Applause] yup mango peached green tea so this is my old lemon sorbet one just pop that out put that right here let's just open this so uh let's see what this is running at did i even tell you the box didn't even see what percentage i think it did last time but here it is one gram that's weird let's try this though so i mean even though it says live resin cartridges i believe it's they use the same method as royal garden because it's very light or the same method as buddies i don't know what exactly they do but [ __ ] it let's crack this open and let's just see oh wait there's some sort of uh wrapping on here some keys for this but yeah hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content and let me know if you've tried bear labs i've only tried two bear labs cartridges and only one of them was good i'm not saying the strawberry cheesecake one was bad but it definitely was not good [Music] so [Music] let's try this this was 32 out the door so definitely not bad i'm not bad at all all right cheers why was it clogged already i'm thinking when it's clogged i think maybe they transport it in a little bit of a warm temperature and maybe it clogged it i don't have no idea but cheers boys not bad a very lemony zesty type of taste but definitely not bad uh i was dreading that it tastes disgusting or at least not not tasty at all but this is very good i would say it's a very minimal tasting lemony one uh kind of like the lemon sorbet but it has its own gorilla glue you know like that piney-ness i'm gonna take another hit though [Music] [Music] it's definitely a hitter holy [ __ ] oh gorilla glue 4 strong sativa hybrid oh it's a bit weird that they didn't have the the can uh cannabinoids or or the yeah i think the last ones i had they had the cannabinoids in the front right here i could be wrong honestly my memory's not as good but definitely not a bad cartridge for 32 i could definitely see myself getting this again and i'm going to take one more hit because why the [ __ ] not it's gorilla glue it's around three it's around 3 p.m right now and what better way or what better time to smoke gorilla glue right then right now you know so cheers i'm about to meet up with the homie be legit maybe do a video after i don't know but cheers wow might even try the other ones because they had because they had a triangle mints but i remember stevie saying that it wasn't that good because he had the wax form i might try it um but they only had three i believe they only had three raw uh i mean i believe they only had four strains when it came to bear labs cartridges triangle mints lemon sorbet strawberry cheesecake and then gorilla glue four so i've already tried three out of the four and triangle mints i might try but like i said my homie stevie tried the wax version and i remember him saying that it was it might have been something else but i'm sure i mean triangle mints is a very strange name something that you probably that would stick out right and uh i just remember him saying that it wasn't as good but i could be wrong so i might try it in the future other than that uh very very good cartridge 32 bucks not bad at all not bad at all i'm gonna take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here cheers oh look how much i hit it all right guys that's gonna be it for the video peace out [Music] uh you", "DNOyf8Y2cTo": "all right I got to make another video because all the comments on the YouTube people don't understand what the [ __ ] an f1 or f2 or clone only people don't understand it like dudes like yeah man gorilla blue seeds yeah you can't say that's gorilla glue because all seeds are most likely in the [ __ ] talking about dude if you've got a gorilla glue pack of seeds it came from the mother of gorilla glue from someone else so I'm explaining to you some of y'all who don't [ __ ] understand or don't know what the [ __ ] a clone only plan is alright that's the gorilla glue number 4 right there ok so what happened was dude found the plant called it gorilla glue number 4 because it was the fourth plant out of 5 seeds at the dude pop okay dude pops 5 seeds BAM the 4th the number 4 he calls it gorilla glue so it gets the girl the blue number 4 name he gives it back to Josey Wales Josey Wales takes a cutting off the plants and I'm about to get to that right now alright check it out these are what we call cuttings alright see that those are clones those are cuttings so what happens is instead of me making seeds with that plant and then sprout the seed and then calling it gorilla glue that's what a lot of people could get and confused that's not technically gorilla glue that's a gorilla glue f1 or an f2 or however far the lineman is worth because all plants are technically F ones all of them you know I'm saying like if I breed those two plants together right there alright and sprout those seeds they're technically F ones of gorilla glue number four and 91 Kim alright see this right there that's a bridezilla that's an f1 of gorilla glue and wedding cake alright that right there that's my banana kook okay that's flat banana cookies number nine that is the number nine good so far so far genetics do pop 300 seeds from a banana oh gee and a [ __ ] blackberry cush formula from exotic genetics and then he came up with the black banana cookies number nine that technically is an F one of those two plants if I take and breathe these two together okay those two together that those T's will become F 1 so technically every plant is an F 1 now if you're working a line so for instance if I take this plant right here and breathe the buck to this to this F 1 and then I get those seeds they're technically F once now if I take a brother or sister from that from that from those sprouts on those seeds and then bring them together their seeds will become F twos all right then if I take a brother or sister from them those seeds become F freeze and they just keep working on down the line that's how people stabilize genetics I'm not stabilized [ __ ] because we're not growing produce all right I don't need a [ __ ] grow a field of corn so that I don't get a bunch of wanky ask for crop I don't need all my [ __ ] if you look the same because we're not growing from seeds for like cultivation like crops okay I'm breeding genetics so people could find fire like so they can just find some dank ass [ __ ] yeah they might get four or five weird-ass plants but they're gonna get one or two in there that's going to be [ __ ] good so that's what people talk about um you know if they use all these [ __ ] weird ass breeder terms and [ __ ] um oh you got a stabilized the genetics blah blah blah no we're not growing crop fields you know I'm saying we're growing plants for keepers because right now if just say for instance this is called bridezillas number one all right I'll pop the proceed from seeds that I created that right there is technically bridezilla number one if I want to keep that plant for myself what I'll do is after it gets done flowering I'll flip it back in the veg get a vegetative cutting off of it like that's what those are these are just Cuddy's these did not come from seeds see that see how they're rooted see that these are rooted cuttings from a plant they're not they're clones they're the identical exact plant of the mother plant people like don't even grass that can't believe some of the comments that I'm reading it's like people don't even understand the difference between a [ __ ] seed and a cut so basically that's how it's done so now if I were to take this and then take take that revenge and get a cutting off of it everybody knows that's bridezilla number one now if I hand that cutting to my buddy he calls it bridezilla number one if he makes [ __ ] seeds with it and hands those seeds out those peeps cannot technically be bridezilla number one because that is the bridezilla number one clone only plant all right he could call it bridezilla Bubba [ __ ] who gives a [ __ ] doesn't matter you can call it where the [ __ ] you want whatever you know what I'm saying but those seeds will never be the clone only plant they will become thin O's of the original plan and that's what I was trying explaining the video and [ __ ] cannot grasp the concept of that [ __ ] it's just like wow like really so basically that's the East Coast Sour Diesel okay that's what this is this is the clonal only East Coast Sour Diesel that I've got that cut from way too [ __ ] far away all right so that's not that none of these plants in here came from seeds none of them I've got all these cuttings from different people you know what I'm saying like they sent them to me because they were the clone only like that plant like this plant right here is like 30 [ __ ] years old that's the 91 Kim Jong VA that [ __ ] came from like the 90s and it's just been what they do is you take a cutting off the plant and you put it back in the veg so technically you can make a plant live as long as you want as long as you keep it under eighteen six of light it will never flower so a lot of these plants in here are old as [ __ ] your hums in and I'm trying to like explain this [ __ ] to people they don't [ __ ] get it so anyway um there's a Sunday driver right there going into flower now it's a Sunday driver I got to paint a canyon that's the Topanga Canyon OD that's a jungle cut that [ __ ] is crazy look at that we're gonna [ __ ] stretch in that thing do the [ __ ] Beast it's only way I just wanted to explain that to people case they don't understand that these are all cuttings that you know they come off yeah see the roots these are all rooted these are ready to go get transplanted these are the next my next teen moms that are gonna be coming around so that's what these are these are all probably rooted I got a transplant at some point in time today so I just wanted to get that out there man because holy [ __ ] dude just trying to explain [ __ ] to people it's [ __ ] impossible you know I'm saying like I got the purple punch here's another one here's a purple punch alright that's the purple punch that that ain't no [ __ ] not even come from see someone gave me that cutting and it's a badass cutting like that's the actual purple punch Nova cut so people get confused when they say oh man up on a pack of purple punch seeds and sprouted them now I've got purple punch so yeah technically you do but you have a purple punch Finn oh you don't have the clone only purple punch all those seeds that you got came from the purple punch mother that's where they all come from same thing with Gorilla Glue if you bought some [ __ ] [ __ ] gorilla glue gorilla bubble [ __ ] gorilla bomb all that stupid [ __ ] if you bought any of those seeds those had to have came from the original gorilla glue for Mom now if you bought now if those people making those seeds don't actually have the real legit Josey Wales gorilla boot number four cut then they're ripping you off they're [ __ ] you they're using a [ __ ] they went and bought like two packs of guerrilla blue s ones or something pop those two packs of seeds and then they [ __ ] like pick the winner number one they picked their number one out of that pack then they made though gorilla then they made their own gorilla blue seeds so technically those seeds aren't coming from the actual real gorilla blue for cut alright that's the best way that I can explain it you want I mean so that's pretty much it I just had to make this video [ __ ] explain like because people like the comment I'm reading and some of the YouTube is like it's [ __ ] crazy like I can't even believe [ __ ] even believe this [ __ ] like they even think the [ __ ] in their brain what their what the [ __ ] are they talking about and I'm like oh god man scum dude was paying something he didn't know cold all of all Gorilla Glue seeds or Gorilla Glue or some [ __ ] and I'm thinking damn dude I mean don't you realized it like baby seeds come from the original mother plant so anyway I want to get that [ __ ] over with out of the way um the bridezilla there's the mother that's the wedding cake that's the mom that's the mom of the arm of the girl the blue number four all right and then I got GMO that's just [ __ ] crazy man yeah so anyway alright well I just want to explain all that stuff you guys don't understand and then something was like oh your plants look like [ __ ] dude I'm growing big-ass plants in one gallon pots you know I'm saying like these [ __ ] drink I'll get like everything that's empty I got to get in here and feed them you know I'm saying I got a million [ __ ] things I'm doing right now I'm making seeds I'm not making like the plants for [ __ ] like prized photo shots to go on [ __ ] the High Times Magazine you know I'm saying I don't give a [ __ ] as long as I get good seeds out of these plants that are healthy I could give a rat's ass so you can talk my plants all you want I don't give a [ __ ] so I just wanted to say you know I'm say I'm growing these big-ass plants in one gallon pot and I think I'm doing pretty damn good you know so this one here's about about done I think that's the the electric East Coast Sour Diesel right there and plant smells like warm butter it's like just straight goodness yeah I do that [ __ ] is fog Bob whoa takes like two hours to get that stink off of you all right well I just wanted to get that out of the way to explain that what was going on and thanks for watching", "zPvkxvcSxaU": "- welcome back to another video thanks for clicking on the video subscribe to the channel leaving a like all that good stuff today bringing you another string review we got two strings right here just pick them up pretty fire not just pick them up I picked them up you yesterday like around my time I've been smoking like I got two strings I've been smoking one of them more than the other one cuz I like this one a lot more I've always liked this one so without further ado let's get it the music down Blaine likes it some random [ __ ] thing on YouTube just so we got some background noise cuz like every [ __ ] music I've been putting on it's been getting copyrighted bro I'm like this stupid Israel so now we got a little little bit of a rave vibe in the background cuz this it doesn't get copyrighted hopefully if it does [ __ ] like I got figuring out a new way you do but yeah we got these two new strains we got gorilla glue number four I've been smoking the [ __ ] out of this one cuz bro this is one of our favorite strange smells so [ __ ] good and then we got another exotic right here like this one it's called solar Akane like this [ __ ] bro smells like legitimate uh pops to promote the orange popsicle that's the best thing I can describe the road i smoke a joint like as soon as I got in the bud both of these bugs I rolled up a fatty of this one smoked it pretty good loved the flavor and everything but being like this is just mine they were like I love this weed room thank you it's it's the hybrid but like it's a heavy hybrid so like it's more on the indica size you know like a really mean so I'm gonna show you guys without you know it's better to show you that before anything I wish you guys can see even on looks like this would fight a [ __ ] nice camera man you wanna come up one in the ancient coconut milk there see so I got 14 in each come on you this one me me in the smell that it sounded like I wish you guys could smell it you it smells like a legitimate like orange popsicle in this case but I haven't been smoking a lot of this my sleep and join in total yesterday to today so I got probably in here like still like 13 grams you know although like the girl like that I've been smoking out [ __ ] out of this one cuz this is one of my favorite Birds about like this is so fire smoke so good like in that taste is just my China taste on board like you know taste like I don't know kind of [ __ ] earth but it's so good just the smell is oh here look at this I wish I could read like you know just an ounce of each but they it gonna be expensive is good so y'all saw the woods let me know what y'all think this is the pink bed full of [ __ ] dog [ __ ] be always peeing in the [ __ ] house broke my sheet like I broke my tripod so I have to fix it with a little duct tape we got a future video income and Tunes them cheap and is about to sing their new device if y'all don't know that you know I got the old Jeep in these [ __ ] are sending out a new device called the wrong with something I won't talk too much about a y'all go see what it gets here they sending it out to me they say like go Bo and appreciate like if I would wanna do the [ __ ] video for them like Oh be they would appreciate if I did a video for them I'm like water broke cuz I already did one for the GP and they [ __ ] with it they means you know that they liked it even more so they won't want for the new product so let's try which strain on the triangle I don't even know which strain I'm doing it's trying to [ __ ] the really cool brother that's my favorite like he's not my favorite favorite stream blegh is one of my favorites you this is pretty good like this week I can't be mad at this we'd like at all like it's small nose that's the only thing I'll be like you know it's just like a small moon but other than that like the weirdest [ __ ] fire I've been smoking a non stop listening specifically I felt like of the gorilla do I have like probably over like a 7 brains but that means is good wait bro so we're going to do this straight review a little different because my bones are always dirty we want to try out a new bomb not a new ball but you know where the bombs out of my bomb collection there's a [ __ ] bomb Galatian like not too big but we gonna use these wonderful wakes me they're gonna bring out the big one the big gun let's get the shooting I know it's a little bit dirty but it's not as much that give the other one so don't forget to go check the other video that I just posted bro doing a watermelon bong that [ __ ] was so dope like I've done it for Instagram and I did it a different way this way it's easier and it's quicker you know you're like y'all get a [ __ ] melon bro like when you're one more in case of anything happening oh [ __ ] little technical problem the trashcan right here we just dump it up come on sucker right he's a little bit more though yeah but like I said good chick out then you video bro smoking out of a [ __ ] water the owner of the Vipers will be staying healthy with this Khurana [ __ ] so but the only thing I was changing this bump is the setup right here like I would make a little bit like extra long so when you hit it like you'll see it better because when I eat it from up right here like you can you can't really see the [ __ ] ball the only thing I'll change you gotta keep it a real no this is no artist this probably licensed China Glaze you know the price on this was 140 so you know it's cheap and I know some people are like 140 that's cheap yeah bro there's some [ __ ] bones out there [ __ ] ex-ante brows I worth it in a small shop over here it's called Lily's glass shop don't [ __ ] guys live like pigs in see this bomb is finished like I'm talking like 15,000 20,000 and they said that that's nothing like there's people that have over a hundred thousand dollars in waste and it might be like two pieces the three pieces that's worth $100,000 so we tried out the gorilla view number four out of this bomb I don't know what to name it let me know what you guys won't want to call to the bomb room the percolator [ __ ] Park you later bro late cuz you got a program here to park right here haven't ripped this in the world [Music] [Music] mm oh [ __ ] going straight to the lungs this shit's a ripper didn't really get a taste of it on this one bro I think the beaker is the base for the tasting cuz this [ __ ] bro who wasn't expecting their River hey it's strong like the hate it was strongest [ __ ] so you know I'm already feeling the highs that I drop in a little bit the effort tastes kind of [ __ ] earth you look just like a girl you like would taste bubbling earthy powerful yeah you can't go wrong it doesn't have to be gorilla food on the floor like any of you I'd oh nine times out of ten you're gonna be going damn but with this [ __ ] photo when you can be to the face all right now we're gonna take a boundary oh [ __ ] it's so breaking this one is the best smelling one in terms of smell that's all the King means it it looks - it looks - if you like you know purple blood and [ __ ] like that it looks exotic silver cane is the choice you want to go like you feel like bugs gonna [ __ ] you up gorilla good so cane I don't know like you know I'm talking to you Blake they might [ __ ] you up because it's a like this one the Solarcaine is a [ __ ] is I think those Cheetos in purple punch so you know it's strong they're both indicates so you know it's a [ __ ] indicate strong strong but this one bro but smell but this one you know the really movies are more like this is a cross a [ __ ] sour dub Jam something bright so it don't leave me yes all right no because I don't know that you know what Buddhist trains or something like I saw it on leave me yeah both strings third they're like pretty good bro I'm pretty strong this one is stronger the gorilla was stronger so all right you know that's the one I'm going I haven't even smoked this one but I already know that gorilla do for me though I'm talking a little bit too much because you know that moment giving it a little bit of time of the lungs don't but the density on this bud is crazy hailer [ __ ] games family I was thinking about doing a vlog type of video outside but look at this foot length y'all painting is evil like your message chooses over here is [ __ ] raining bro when there's not raining it's snowing like it's [ __ ] stupid we need some room but now with the summer like with this [ __ ] of this thing with the corona [ __ ] like we can't even leave the house now we can of course but like everything's close to we can go on hiking view and going hiking you go hike around not stable like my [ __ ] house where that's it sheesh this grind it up smells even better friend this son like old times type of pain all right you gonna change up all right so let's put the silver can the bull we gonna take the same read this [ __ ] respect the same thing as Lessman it's not fully imagined you can put you can fit another almost a gram in here we're like baked up no problem cuz this [ __ ] is white I'm not picking a lot because I want to snap this I'm thinking like 0.2 0.3 all right let's rip this [ __ ] this won't hurt that's why I prefer my beeper beaker is my favorite my favorite I don't give a [ __ ] you this is the best kind of box for flour this is the best ending for Dave's like [ __ ] with the particulars like a puzzle this one's my favorite one for Dave's now is this one here Ripper Ripper so Ricky [Music] [Music] Hey look [Music] hail naw bro that she got me and this shit's tail now I'm not gonna take that one that [ __ ] was still this [ __ ] hallo yo but the flavor is crazy like even a harsh one the flavour is overpowering room taste on this one Wayne's the die gorilla who ten times more flavor subrogate a little bit harsher a little bit harsh I'm not gonna lie or a kid because already coughed so like you know your lungs are a hundred percent maybe I should start doing this train reviews like I don't know bro like what a joint roll a joint of each it may be like you know cuz I love doing like there's a let's move let's move George all the time you know up tomorrow everywhere is like you know there's our [ __ ] school these papers are all open in the Bakke cuz like every raw paper if you open up the bag they bring like a free filter thing right here they can make filters out out of so light I'm a lot of filters so I opened up all my pegs in the bake and I feel this this is a leftover thing right here like it's perfect the Mayfield's is were like super like you know dope you didn't know now you know that's why maybe I'm gonna start doing it let me know that on the comments if y'all [ __ ] more with the bongs or I should start rolling up joints you see what's up let me know or both do a joint in the row in the bar where I doubt that cuz I'm gonna be away for like the video without any flesh from this just like lighting look at this solar weekend I always shall get some mentally for real really good really flight not gassy fruitiest fugly he smells like the [ __ ] orange popsicle no camera and then got the [ __ ] gorilla glue this [ __ ] is fire too like for real super guys no producer because the goons bro come on yeah hope you enjoyed the video I hope you enjoyed the video let me know down in the comments if you want to see the [ __ ] like if you don't want me to roll a joint of each instead and then try them out and set up the bong rips let me go down on comments subscribe

"[Music] greetings again friends we're back here from the soil farms I'm cannabis Kurt and this is the flower hour today we're gonna be talking about gorilla glue number four this strain is a true phenome number four unlike traditional indica gorilla glues this is an 80% sativa dominant phenome rgg 4 will get you up off the couch it fills the room with a pungent and earthy type sour aroma what I love about it is that it looks so good it's like you're smoking the crystals right off the bud it is by far one of our best it is literally flying off the shelves so I advise you go out there and

today we have a huge review lined up because we are going to be reviewing gorilla glue number four by nectar farms you guys gorilla glue number four or gg number four as you might see it now advertised is one of the most popular strains of all time it is not a strain that needs any introduction here on cannapedia although i believe that maybe we've only reviewed gorilla glue once before on this channel if uh at all to be honest with you i've got a lot of experience with this strain though you guys so i want to talk to you guys about it now this is a very potent hybrid strain that is a cross between the parent genetics of kem's sister chocolate diesel and sour dub you guys so three huge parent strains coming together to create gorilla glue number four so before we dive into this review i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so what did you guys think of this gorilla glue number four by nectar farms you guys i am very curious so let me know in the comments below what you guys think so let's go ahead and let's jump right into this review so the first thing i want to mention that is this you guys so i am filming this review on september the 20th okay this review won't be released until the 18th of november now this stuff was harvested on june 25th so figure june 25th july 25th august 25th uh and then september you know 25th which is only five days away that's almost three months so if this stuff isn't fully cured out now you guys it shouldn't be cured out you know so let's go ahead and see what this stuff is all about okay so you guys the first things first this is a typical gorilla glue flavor i am getting hints of pine or like that cushy evergreen flavor i'm getting hints of gassy kind of that chem so that kem's sister is definitely in there and then absolutely those diesel from the chocolate diesel you guys so chem and diesel kind of smell similar but like and then the pine you know i'm smelling as well um oh like i said the pine i think is my like what's in the forefront though you guys this smell is intoxicating i personally think this smells unfreaking believable and truthfully it's great to get weed that smells like weed you guys this is what gorilla glue is supposed to be like so they're absolutely got gorilla glue here you guys and damn now i'm not gonna lie you guys holy cow holy cow my i can even see my flashlights going out a little bit here but man this stuff like the trichomes now it's not covered in trichomes by any means like this butt is not covered in trichomes but the trichomes that are here are so big and fat you guys wow like i'm that i'm actually really shocked about so you guys can see this is like a kush type of bud structure and it's just kind of like that pine coney bud structure and these thin thin hairs their peach colored hairs scattered throughout this bud you guys um it looks leafy but it's it's like and it is because this is kind of more of a leafy strain it's just not dense you guys this is not a dense bud so this entire jar is pretty much filled now mind you nectar gives you 3.7 but like i'm very god gotta be honest you guys i mean this is some very good looking gorilla glue and like gorilla glue i don't think is one of the best looking strains of all time but this is what it's supposed to look like you guys they did a great job with this i am so excited to try this and like this whole time i've been actually doing a little bit of work before i started this review and i had the bowl that i'm about to puff heating up and i can smell that pine coming out it was like oh my gosh i'm so excited to try this stuff out like i can't even tell you guys it's been a minute since i've had some legit true gorilla glue and i know this is true legit gorilla glue because i've seen it about 100 times so you guys um let's go ahead and what i was going to say the joke is about 10 times and it's from something about mary if you've never seen that movie mary has an autistic brother and she's dating this guy ted and ted walks in the door and mary says to to warren her brother the autistic brother of hers is warren did you say hello to ted and warren's responses about 10 times and it's really funny you guys my mom teaches children or taught i should say children with disabilities learning disabilities and this is nothing i'm not like trying to to hate on them or make fun of them or anything like that it was a funny movie in a funny line in a movie you know we love everybody i am embrace everybody and again this is not a hit be like oh ari oh man he's a jerk he was making fun of an autistic kid no that's not the case it's a line from a movie you guys so about ten times but i don't know how i got so sidetracked of you guys i am so excited though today you guys that was my attempt at comedy or trying to explain uh something funny that was in a movie that's completely out of context here in a weed's train review but anyways you guys if you've seen it you know it's funny and you know that line but anyways today i'm going to be enjoying the gorilla glue out of my air riser extreme q it's set to 375 degrees fahrenheit there and i have just cleaned out the whip and this screen that's going to be going into the vape itself and then i've got one more nail end there that one doesn't have a screen but that one is actually going to be plugged into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler let's do it once around there and in this first chamber there you guys is actually in the downstem typically you put uh carbon that would catch ash that would dirty up your water which is basically your second chamber so i've got some brand new purified water in the second chamber here as well as an organic cotton filter and the third chamber there to filter out any remaining impurities and it's going to actually just ensure that i'm getting the cleanest rip possible to report these terpenes as accurately as i possibly can so without further ado you guys i am so excited to try this g4 also known as gorilla glue number four so if you guys are ready i'm ready let's go ahead dive right in and get this party started oh mama you guys it's rare ninety percent of the way through that rip i'm still blowing out smoke or vapor i can feel that coming on i'm getting the classic pine kush flavor some of that gas a little bit of the diesel and mind you i don't know well i do know i should say you guys it's three months old this butt is so cured out it's just vaping like crazy right now you guys so man i'm diving back in i hope this tastes last and i honestly like i'm so excited for this bowl you guys i'm just diving back and i'm not waiting you guys i can tell ya i'm not coughing because that wasn't smooth coughing because that was potent you guys this is potent stuff i can already feel it starting to work my head's starting to get that like warm tinglies um you guys wow more pine cushy evergreen aroma um not like a little bit of the gas or diesel like the chem flavor in there but the pine is really what's standing out to me and then i'm guessing that that chem and um diesely flavor i bet you that develops in this bowl as i finish ripping this but we'll see what happens i don't know what to expect so man i'm so excited to finish out this bowl but while i'm doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under a 25 times magnification macro lens you get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here it comes now all right so you are looking at the gorilla glue number four by nectar farms you guys can see this is just that typical really light lime green color this every time i have seen gorilla glue you guys it's looked just like this now you guys can see a few of those really lightly colored peach hairs that are interwoven throughout this bud which is typically like as you guys can see right here a little bit leafier and light and fluffy than it is dense you guys and those hairs aren't really in perfect proportion to the crystals on this they're a little more sparsely uh scattered throughout the bud and this stuff isn't what i would consider like the most covered in trichomes so it's good looking bud and it's pretty typical for gorilla glue but this is definitely a good representation from nectar farms okay you guys so you just had a chance to check this stuff out under that macro lens what did you guys think to me you know i i said it before i feel like gorilla glue is just kind of one of these strains that's like it's a good looking strain but it's not a great looking strain and i mean i think these guys did do an absolutely wonderful job with it um but boy oh boy you guys this was an exciting review for me today and probably because i haven't reviewed really good gorilla glue in a while and honestly i feel like this is a great representation of gorilla glue just you know aesthetically from what it looks like bag appeal and the smell and stuff so i want to talk to you guys about what the actual vaping experience was like and i want to give you guys my final rundown on this stuff because this stuff was like it's kind of what i expected but not exactly what i expected there were some areas where i was kind of a little bit surprised here so i want to go ahead and jump right into this review so before i do that i want to give you guys the rundown on how i do these reviews you guys all of the buds are rated on a scale from zero to ten and i break that down in four different categories the look the smell the taste and the potency or how effective this medicine is each of those categories can earn up to 2.5 points each in its respective category hopefully adding up to a total of 10. so i want to start by talking about the look or the bag appeal of this gorilla glue number four by nectar farms so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen for you guys one last time to check out and then we're gonna go ahead and dive right in to my final rating okay you guys you've seen the gorilla glue number four or gg number four as you may see it labeled buy nectar farms multiple times okay so you've seen it multiple times i'm gonna i want to give you guys my personal you know thought on this bud and my rating is i don't think necessarily to be honest with you that there's anything the guys and team over at nectar farms can do to improve this bud i really don't i mean you know maybe a little more dense um you know crystal coverage like some of these leaves aren't super crystally but like honestly the crystals that are here are great they're huge the uh you know the trichomes that i'm talking about there and this stuff is just frosty as frosty gets i mean the ones that are here holy cow you guys these are huge trichomes um but that being said i just personally don't think gorilla glue is a strain that's like anything to write home about on a um you know uh like compared to other buds i mean you guys go through and look at some of like the buds that i would consider like a perfect perfect looking bud and i mean even though i think this is perfect for gorilla glue i i don't want to give this a 2.5 and honestly i'm going to tell you normally i probably would okay normally i would but i'm going to kind of show you why i don't feel as though they deserve it and you know some of these buds are just this butt is no [ __ ] it's so sticky you guys that they're like stuck together in here but like i'm not joking besides the like two little buds i had these are it this is like look at this you guys those are popcorn buds you guys and uh one just fell out and i'm gonna grab it here off screen in just a second but i'll tell you what you guys popcorn buds for me sorry for that um popcorn buds for me you guys i will tell you they don't cut it around here i you know you can't get a 2.5 selling me popcorn buds you know i am not looking for popcorn corn buds in my 50 plus tax aters um so i'm going to give them a 2 out of 2.5 in the looks department but on to the smell department you guys this is one where most people come up short and i will tell you the team at nectar farms did not come up short on the smell even as i pull it away i can still smell it and i will tell you if i left this open it would fill up the whole room you guys that is a 2.5 out of 2.5 it smells like kush you guys or you know chem or diesel kind of like all three of those had a baby that is some sweet hot action you guys pull your mind out of the gutter and stop thinking about marijuana plants having sex you guys here's the deal i want to tell you that this flavor gorilla glue is like quintessential classic gorilla glue if you've never had gorilla glue and you want to smell what it smells like buy some of the nectar farms gorilla glue this is a great representation of what it is supposed to smell like it's identical it's spot on and it's very aromatic 2.5 out of 2.5 from the smell taste now you guys i'm gonna be honest those first two were good there's something that was a little off like a little scratch in my throat on this stuff it wasn't as smooth as i wanted it to be um even though it was smooth it wasn't as smooth as i wanted it to be and like you know because it's a potent strain you do cough a lot after you hit this stuff and just as i suspected the pine flavor that i had originally towards the beginning of this it did change it went to like kind of a musky gassy um you know type flavor as this bowl progressed literally like after that second rip it kind of went and transformed it was almost as if like what i exactly what i said kind of came to fruition on this um you know and it just kind of proceeded till i started just tasting that um leaf plant material you know but it's good but it's not great the flavor of this in my particular opinion in my particular opinion so i'm only going to give it a two i mean a two is still good really really good on a 2.5 in the taste department now in the potency you guys this has all the potency this is effective medicine i'm going to give it a 2.5 out of 2.5 and i'm going to tell you why because like i said after each rip i was getting those deep coughs and for me it was like kind of an instant head rush um my body is chill and my mind is really kind of like it's it's almost like um i've got a little haziness but it's clear and it's still functional so i'm not sure like how to describe it other than like there's a haze but it's still functional and i still like i'm kind of like lifted it's kind of the best way to put it you know um so yeah 2.5 out of 2.5 and to be honest you guys this is after i had already had a really good strain uh you know hours ago earlier in the day today i did one earlier strain review for the sunny mac that came out two days ago that review and i'll tell you what you guys for this to still have my second of the day and just pack this punch 2.5 out of 2.5 banger banger so it's going to be a two in the look department a 2.5 in the smell department a two in the taste department and a 2.5 in the pones here how effective this medicine is department that is a nine you guys oh my god hot damn gina pick up some of this nectar farms gorilla glue if you want gorilla glue if you want a great representation of what this strain is for sure i would recommend using it out of a vaporizer you guys and i mean i'm not selling that i'm just saying it for your health and if you want to experience these terpenes and exactly what this stuff is supposed to be you guys know as soon as you light the bud you know it's combusting okay so i don't care if you like those wick waxes or the hemp wax ones you know whatever it is you don't want to use a lighter you know it doesn't matter you are still combusting the bud it completely changes the pro the profile of these terpenes and i do this because i enjoy the medicine and i want to live a healthy good peaceful and positive life and i want to feel the best that i can possibly feel and i can tell you guys that when i was smoking out of the bong when i was pulling those you know bubbler rips and the vape uh excuse me and then transitioned to the vape it's like god just such a godsend to my throat and my body and everything just feels better so i'll tell you guys this is some killer stuff nine out of ten for the gorilla glue number four by nectar farms have you guys tried this train i definitely am absolutely wanting to know what you guys think about it so let me know in the comments below but also you've seen we've had some awesome strains from nectar farms what are some other strains you guys uh recommend from nectar farms let me know in that in the comment below as well and also as always we are looking for the elusive 10 so if you know where to find one put the comments in the section below i want to find the elusive 10 and i want to help you guys find it so with that being said as always you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "VUAdzl3RIJU": "oh [ __ ] ah [Music] guys you know what time it is when I play this song send another one from the mad cannabis scientists this is the end of the Gorilla Glue guys so this is the last plan I've been trimming trim interim in this is a pretty bland I've already picked off a couple branches off for this one and a lot of believes off of this one [Music] I'm gonna get in trouble for using this song sorry Damon I'm just busting out some medication I'm not getting paid for this but here you guys go oh [ __ ] the joint so this is the box right now [Music] [Applause] sorry guys okay Google pause so this is the gorilla goonz and the blue gelato blue gelato came down at flushed out it's not my favorite to grow I need the blue gelato down there down there down there this is the gorilla glue clones guys got fat mugs on their fat Nog's purple leaves purple buds got about four rows going back there if you can see this one's two rows plus down there is gonna be filled up and I still got this one to finish up today but this is another journey remember guys I grew these ones with advanced nutrients so I did advance nutrients all the way up into the flush because when I ordered the flush I didn't receive it so I needed to find something else to take place of that plus I gave it a little something else too for a booster that I took out a regiment from their feeding line from their complete line and I had it two different things so the first thing I added was this I ran out of the mad scientist this is the Turpin eater sorry my flash is shining on top of that very bad but this is the Turpin eater I got this bottle for about 20 bucks off of ebay so I did change that part of it I did use the but candy all the way to the end almost and then I used some of this pineapple rush just a change around the flavors because I think pineapple goes good with gorilla glue but doesn't change the flavor very much I don't think so anyway so I used those two and then I went to this for the flush I really like this [ __ ] guys I had a lot of people had bad reviews on it good reviews but I used only this and flush pH to my water down to 5.5 so that it you know when you feed the water gets less the pH goes up that's just how it is so that's what I changed in this so the flush was with that when I did use the terpene I believe that's how you spell it I say yeah I did smell the difference I mean I know I smell the difference with the turpan ater already I've seen the difference in the trichrome production and how sticky the plant says I can barely get through one branch without having to wipe my scissors with the alcohol wipes to keep using them how about maybe I don't know 10 pairs of scissors maybe more 12 I don't know and I wash them all and I go through them and I wipe them a couple times and then I change the scissors change the scissors change the scissors I use the dull scissors my old dull scissors to cut the bigger branches and fan leaves off and then when I got to get into the but I use the sharper ones but anyway guys this is another journey this is another finished product into flower going into its drying tent and my relative humidity right now where I live and I live in the desert so it's very dry is still running about 78% in my garage so when the tent goes up it goes up to about 81% I seen last night when I shut everything down the fan runs 24/7 on that it's not a big fan it's just using to move the air around so I get in a mold but yeah we're gonna go ahead I'm gonna make this video and then I'm gonna come back with the dry supply and guys I did finish one video finish one video I did finish one plant earlier than the others I do staged plants and small pots that so I can chop that one down and dry it and cure it before the other ones finish so I can see at least where it's gonna be what the flavor is gonna be like and what it tastes like and you know what the [ __ ] kicked my ass roll the joint the other day and you're talking about maybe a week and a couple days into cure and I should kick my ass dude are you talking about 70 to 80% trichomes on top of these but I rolled up a blunt does my first blend I have a rolls I should have took a video of it it's pretty big blunt smoked half of it and I went up to the room put on my show just chilling out waiting for the baby to come home from school before I know it the baby's not getting on me saying hey Dad I'm home I said oh [ __ ] I fell asleep but so it's pretty potent stuff I was really stoned off of that joint really nice colors in there guys yeah really nice hard hard hard but I mean this was our dance [Music] alright guys this is another one for the mad cannabis like this although please like and subscribe don't forget the mountain and don't get it out peace hey", "nGGvBkSiwak": "[Music] [Applause] hi guys is toxic meet Emma back again today and today we've got another kind of a strain review but before we get into all that what I can say is where this is a hospital what our sponsors asked us to say in the videos is make sure if you're going to get a certain strain or a certain thing and if I've done a review of it make sure to do in written review in the video you're gonna be doing the written review on and in the comments in the comments you can say in the comments basically and you will get 10% off your next purchase so that's amazing almost wants up so thank you very much to the sponsor so there's definitely a little increase what's going on so come on guys you can see the views picking up people doing what they need to be doing that's it in life I speak in riddles to keep it on the schedule as I would say it my way of getting around things my way of feeling in terms I speak in riddles normal to get me anything I'm me I'm a smoker and last up so there's people out there that really want to push me into the ground at the moment and he's funny it's really funny why just got taken down there's a couple of people said that it was just the best thing that Instagram was doing but what I reckon it was was a lot people message me as soon as that back down so this is this funny it's very funny I didn't point no fingers no wonder and people assumed but anyways I do my own thing that's that makes you check out my sponsors stuff make sure you review in the video of what you smoke and what you got to begin a review one and you'll get 10% discount guys so that's me anyways we're going to try to keep this one as short as possible guys so what we're gonna do is showing you the packaging so we've got critical in fall we've already done this before I know about guys but uh sponsors asked do it again because he's got it back in again now so this is the us in book so from America's ice for now so make sure you get yourself one of these because in the pictures that he sent me one of the pictures on the package in it actually said twenty seven point five percent THC so this is very strong so yeah I'd like a tiki bar across the top basically what he I was twenty seven point seven TMC and in like a little slash mark cpt zero zero back to zero point zero seven so it's a really nice string I know the THC levels of this one so we're talking know enough thirty percent THC so this is very strong guys there was two grams as you sent in the packet had one off as we always did so we can have it up try to see if is any different anything sleeveless this was a lot more Louisville and sweet smells and sweet taste within floral notes so yeah anyways what we're going to do go straight into this open up smell the parents waiver numbers as a squat 10 and then we taught you the table at the end guys so we're going to do this pretty fast because I'm not doing half an hour videos our videos 25 minute videos and on buses wicker again just so you guys don't like to keep asking but if you do need to put it the comment in the comments and you will get back to you this was a really pungent skunky fuel smell so you got up like funky fuel you know there's a great punch this one is really really punchy guns [Music] you got like us lettuce spicy note over the earthy like fresh graph you know like I said you got that blue behind it that definitely the guerrilla glue is like the it's hard to explain it's very few ly dirty sweet pine but this one like I said this one's very floral very pungent it's cool so let's get this one up guys out Ted what we're going to give this walk is a 10 because that smell is wonderful literally guys it is wonderful quite ugly for is one of the best strains if you get imported it's amazing so yeah [Music] so what we're going to do is come into the parents no guys so as we obviously there are some pictures of this but as we always do we're gonna describe it have a look at it yourself and then show you guys so we'll let you know and then show you guys what it's like as we're letting you know there's gonna be pictures so now what we see straight away is the really really light really really lot green but really that covered rien cup of milk in a really like what crystally thing what you would get normally off old school like weird up this is how this looks it looks like a old school White Widow but you can smile it's not old school White Widow it's got that really really light colors but the there's a few little old fun lease has been trimmed down and basically you can see they're darker so there is a few little balconies sorry guys we still got my cold so you will hear me sniffling all the way through this video before the MU like coughing up my lungs after right at forum as well but the pistils it enter parrot on this one horribly battle there's a few really or little ones for those everything is all stuff against the boat everything's all graphic and everything to order against the but this is really dense ask why how the floods literally grabbed altered everything can just packed it into one [Music] I'm squeezing as hard as I can now thus given a little bit place you know has been cured nicely but there's not too much play and there's no moisture there's a little bit like stickiness from the resinous resinous trichomes but not from anything to do it that way because we have already got pictures off this one you won't need to get picture so I'm going to snap it hopefully you guys right back rubs a nice nap you out wow you know that's really pungent and fueling very happily like floral engine and fuel Australian nice guns nothing crack know it's caught up and I will show you some people you can see basically you reckon this perfectly this one's perfect maybe the pistol sent the perfect the most perfect but pistol sent really the most apparent in the appearance anyways you're not looking for a lot of pistol cartridge in your bud you want more trichomes pistols nice because I can't remember what the carrier think it might be a Roma and Turks but I don't entirely know don't hold me to that might be enough compound guys so if anyone doesn't know what pistols do carry is in the compound a lot of components are available so as a cop the compounds let me know I love learning about this but now we're going to show you guys this part so you know try getting some combo [Music] [Music] [Music] we won't ignore my feelings because the videos been ten minutes already anyway what we're gonna do now boss got a tenth of smile I paint my parents

easier sweating going sweating because we're trying to rush right anyways make yourself a bomb I'm just a see you for your clothes and I going for the flavor [Music] [Music] now that was smooth for my chest econ like I still speak a little cop awful but that's really smooth so if you didn't have a coffin of guys the first thing you went in the theater initial flavor very do all the engine pine you've got a sweet woody skunking frame covered up very distinctive like you can taste this critically even know this from a grid of glue all oh yeah this which is really nice and you get a really woody they really would appoint me it's papers you get a main fuel would you point then that skunk way it's like hot explain the cookies leader what's the most why this explain similar to diesel buddy not-so-hidden Brno so why on the tip of Tony's can still taste the pair of Latinos so we have to put the bong and all that like over to the bus talk before we do the flavor gets a 10 guys so so far this is on the 30 very carefully like I said a few over be did you save up this bar record from this like this smart this one is a little bit different to the other one and little bit different it's similar the nice no more works on the food for this winners so now guys we're gonna go into the buzz and already is kicking in so hit yourself a bomb see you guys for the clouds and we're going to go

"bBX0RxlkLd0": "[Music] folks it's time this gorilla clues been hanging here for eight days it is now dry still smells wonderful doesn't smell like hay so it's time to trim it chart let it start caring and I'll be able to let everybody know the total dried weight that I got from this so stay tuned so it's time to trim and jar this gorilla glue number four my fist crews ready it's ten days ago that the plant was put into the dark tent and eight days ago that I chopped it hung it since then I removed the center branches hung them separately hoping that would help it to dry more efficiently reduce the chance of any mold or anything like that and my ink Burt humidity controller was originally set at 58% and I after a couple days I reduced it to fifty five percent so the drying process is done now it's time to trim and jar and let those buds start caring so my plan is to just take this off one branch at the time I've got my trim bin in the other room and some gloves it all wear well let's get started so got my trim bin by harvest more it's pretty handy little product keeps all the mess contained screen so the trichome heads can fall through there into the bottom handy little brush to collect them all mostly it's just nice because it keeps the mess contained well I'm no expert trimmer I think different people have different techniques this product is not for sale this is just for personal use any of these little people referred to that it's larf I'm just going to throw it down there it'll go into a bag in the freezer and I'll use that to make some hash later on as for the buds themselves I tried to get in there close so they kind of the base of the leaf trim it off I just kind of rush through it because like I said just for personal use or for myself and a few other loved ones bag quality or the appearance isn't actually that important that's uh so I've had a lot of work ahead of me you don't need to watch it off I'd be quite boring I'm sure so I'll keep trimming away turn the camera back on accomplished a bit pretty sure watching some guy trim bud it's not entertaining they call it trim jail for a reason my sentence doesn't last too long anyways I'll shut the camera off I'll bring you back in a little bit when there's actually something to show all right I've been at it for a couple hours about half done a lot of nice buds trimmed up I'll get alert it's uh all the calyxes that grow along the stem and keeping them separate just for the heck of it and the scissors have been getting really gunked-up so been scraping them clean every now and then get little pile of scissor hash on to go yeah just keep at it thud it give an update of where I'm at about halfway done things aren't too bad it's open done all this trim and the purim in the beauty of it of course is the screen all those trichome heads can fall through the screen that over here hopefully you can see that trimmed in also comes with this little brush works real well for gathering up so I've got quite quite the collection here I'll get that cleaned up and yeah I would say that cleaned up I'll get to weighing the results but good a nice big bowl of buds and trimmed high fast you can see the Fox tailing there on some of them though again it's not like these were for sale or anything therefore personally use appearance isn't that important but yeah I've got a nice big bowl of buds this other container of the smaller popcorn larf stuff and then the calyx is that I don't know what I'll do with those and yeah the scissor hash as well ended up to be quite a bit there really we'll save that for another day so anyway so yeah I'll get this cleaned up and then we'll get the scale and see what the results are good are all weighed up I ended up with exactly five ounces of trimmed dried buds each of these jars holds exactly an ounce again not the best trim job ever it'll do and then I had about twelve point five grams of this popcorn bud though lar fees stuff I don't know what's gonna come of it and then from the trim bin when I cleaned up the bottom of it I got one point four grams of well I guess essentially trichome heads so there might be some contaminants in there but it's awfully sparkly yeah all in all I guess I'm satisfied over five ounces is pretty good certainly room for improvement but uh yeah I'm happy so I guess that concludes the gorilla glue part of it the jack hair just got put into the dark tent so it'll be a video about that coming soon and now I can focus on exclusively Otto flowers and in the tent alright well end that there yeah so five ounces and about a half ounce of scrap stuff other than that I'm satisfied so gorilla glue number four from Canucks seeds I would call it a success alright that's that this is Grammy signing off we'll see you in the next one", "tLF5AvIDKZE": "what up and welcome to canape where we are bringing you honest and unbiased cannabis strain review so today we are going to be reviewing gg number four otherwise known as gorilla glue number four by trike companies and gorilla glue number four is a classic stream that is a hybrid strain that combines chem sisters sour dub and chocolate diesel so oh my gosh you guys i have been wanting to get my hands on some gorilla glue they have changed the name now to gg number four probably because of some illegal issues i'm sure but this stuff is a long time favorite of mine we have not tried any of the trike products so i'm so excited to try this out today but before we get started i want to show you what this stuff looks like so i'm going to bring it up on the screen now and then we'll look at it together all right so you guys just had a chance to check it out and let's go ahead and let's talk about it you guys to me when i saw this so i picked this up off of health for life at health for life off of crimson and i was going in there to take advantage of the first time special which basically gives you any of their top tier eighth and get one free um so this was in the 35 category so i'm not expecting it to be the very very top top shelf but when i saw it i was like oh my gosh that looks just like quintessential gorilla glue so i had to have it i had to have it i am getting some of that gassy you know diesely smell from this but it's very subtle you guys like the terps aren't really kicking in this and i'll tell you even when it's like and it's not super spongy this is actually it's i mean it's it's kind of spongy and i i am getting underneath some of that real diesel aroma and you guys this is what this stuff looks like you know as far as the full bud goes so you guys can kind of get a a little bit of a better look at that um but like all things considered you guys this stuff is really really frosty the trichomes aren't huge though you guys like i'm honestly i'm not super blown away by the trichomes on this stuff and i mean this is a hybrid strain but to me it's always been like an indica leaning string they came up with the name because it makes you feel glued to your chair i was reading somewhere earlier i was like oh this sativa dominant strain i'm like since when has gorilla glue ever been a sativa it's always been indica dominant for me but the more i'm looking into it everybody reports this is just a pure hybrid strain so um you know again i wish the terps were a little bit better and especially after i ground it up i was expecting the aroma of this bud to be released a bit more and it really wasn't this is my first time trying anything from tripe but they're kind of like the lower to mid tier i don't really see them putting out any top shelf products um so you know still excited to try it out today so today i'm going to be trying this gg number four gorilla glue number four out of my arizer extreme q bad boy is set to 375 degrees fahrenheit and i am feeding that i've got two male ends one is going into the vape that end that's going into the vape is got a double screen there and then i am feeding that other male end into my triple filtered scientific inhalations bubbler and this piece you guys i've left the first chamber empty which is where the carbon would go no ash is getting in the second chamber which is where my purified water is sitting right now obviously the piece has been completely cleaned before the review today and i've got a brand new organic cotton filter in the third chamber to filter out any remaining impurities that might not have gotten purged out in the final part process of the growing here so with that being said i hope you guys are ready get your pieces all sparked up and fired up and let's get this gorilla glue number four by tri companies in our body all right you guys that was one thing i've got to say that was like a big first vaporit a lot bigger than i was expecting and it was pretty smooth like not the smoothest we've ever tried before but like it it's got like a little of that diesel flavor i've got that hint of diesel like that's the flavor that i i am tasting personally a little bit it's like a little sour but diesel is the flavor i want to see if that flavor develops after this second rip here so let's go ahead and take that now that finished out real nice it's like i could feel it coming on about halfway through not super super boat and strong but like that flavor is kind of like a creamy creamy diesely and again not the absolute smoothest especially out of this many pieces being filtered together but like i'm still getting some actual decent terps they're not you know not terrible the fact that there's some terps on here at all is great so i'm gonna go ahead and finish out this bowl and while i'm doing that i'm gonna bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out up close and personal under a 25 times magnification macro lens so here that comes now all right so you are looking at the gorilla glue number four by trike and you guys this has got that classic gorilla glue bud structure as well as those hairs kind of a little more sparsely spread out but it's that really really nice lime green color as you guys can see this stuff is really really frosty and then those nice thin peach hairs interwoven throughout the bud this is some quintessential classic looking gorilla glue number four by trey all right so you guys just had a chance to check this out under the 25 times magnification macro lens like what did you guys think about it i would love to know so let me know in the comments below what you guys think of the look of this stuff to me personally like this is okay looking bud i mean it looks very quintessential like again quintessential gorilla glue but there's nothing really to me in my opinion that like really stands out by this bud the only reason i really wanted to do this review today and i got this stuff was because i was like man i haven't had gorilla glue in a while you know i had that first time special you know there and this was something different and a new company that i hadn't seen before but like i'm not overly overly impressed like you know even under the magnification like it looks good but it's not not some of the best that we've seen i personally am pretty sure this stuff was just machine trimmed based on how the leaves kind of form around the bud which basically just indicates that like the machine was pressing the buds together which pressed the leaf to the butt and the leaf didn't get enough leaf matter didn't get cut off of these buds but you know beyond that you guys the smoke of this itself i didn't really enjoy the smoke itself like it it just wasn't as smooth as it should have been and the flavor that i was reporting like that i had at the very beginning like maybe i got a third you know rip that was was you know real juicy with that flavor but then it just died immediately it was like i was chasing the flavor the entire time with this stuff and i do have like i have that blankety kind of like typical like head high um you know where it feels like i have like a beanie on or something like that but like i am getting more of a hybrid type effect in my opinion so it's a pretty well balanced you know not too indica not too sativa um but what i want to do before i give you guys my final rundown on this stuff is i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one more time and then we'll go ahead and we'll talk about it together all right you guys so let's go ahead and talk about this gg number four gorilla glue number four by trite companies you guys so to me i think the first knock that it gets is the smell test it doesn't really pass the smell test for me the terps that are there are just very very subtle and my visual on this like i don't think this looks like any bud that's like oh my gosh it's not going to win any awards certainly by its looks in my opinion it's that really light light lime green color and those really thin thin peach colored hairs and i mean to the naked eye they kind of look a little darker on the darker side but you know the flavor it was it was nice at the very very beginning um you know i did enjoy i did enjoy that but it really the smoke was not all that smooth um in my personal opinion um and uh and also like the the high i'm getting is just kind of like it's a little like synthetic-y or like it's just not i don't think this is clean medicine if that makes sense you know um i don't know if there was like something that didn't get perched out of this i don't know if there was you know something that they sprayed on this or something that they use but like i don't really i'm not enjoying this particular uh you know high to be honest it's just not like a cl it just doesn't feel like clean it's kind of very very heady and not in the best way possible you know in my particular opinion especially like the last review we did um was from that mac uh by true infusion 2.0 and this stuff is like it does not even they're not even in the same category you guys like that's like that's the difference between paying you know a couple bucks more and getting something really really dang and occasionally you will find a steal you know but i don't know i personally am not going to recommend this trike company's gorilla glue number four you know for me just because it's like it does look like gorilla glue and it's not the worst looking bud we've ever seen but it is pretty leafy and it's it's hand trimmed or excuse me it's not hand trimmed i mean they used an auto trim machine for sure on this i don't really like you know the the high of it i'm probably gonna go ahead just honestly i mean because it had some flavor and like this the t it's not like it's not terrible i don't want you guys thinking this stuff is terrible by any means um but you know on a scale of one to ten it's like i gotta rake everything i gotta rate the smoke i gotta rate the high you know to me i'll give it like i was gonna give it a five but it's like man is it even a five is it even a five because it's like it did something but like no you guys i think i want to give this like a four and a half honestly i think i'm gonna give this strike by this gorilla glue by try company it's a four and a half that that's because i just i'm not really enjoying the the feel of it and again it's like it's just because there's something synthetic about this this is just some something maybe just didn't uh happen in the growing process properly but like i'm not enjoying this particular strain and again it's not you know you guys know i love medicine i love medicating but it's like this is not the feeling that i am going for and again it's not because it's not like it's too high or it's too low it's just it's it's heady in a not clean way if that makes sense i don't know but when you smoke bad medicine you know that feeling and you know this is not one that i'm gonna recommend i don't want you guys to go out and buy this stuff so uh yeah shelf this strike stuff i don't know i'm not super impressed you guys my first run with this trike but there is always next time and we have got some amazing stuff lined up so four and a half on the gorilla glue for trike companies and with that being said you guys take care of yourselves and one another until then see you guys soon peace", "30WHQdDch5I": "hey what's going on guys it should boy pee here with urban growth just want to welcome you back to the day 35 episode of this lovely gorilla glue now if you have been following around or following along from week to week you'll notice that the view of the canopy has kind of changed all I did was I just turned the table and basically gave it a different angle so I hit the light and catch reflection off the wall as well but I wanted to go ahead and jump into things and you know just kind of let you guys know what's going on there's not too much to update on obviously the budget putting on weight as you can see extremely frosty I'll get you some close-ups here at the end of the video but a couple of things I wanted to touch base on first and foremost you know from this point forward the basic formation of the bud is complete all you're looking at really is you know density coming on more trichome production and just really swelling up all those calyxes as well from this point forward it's a real important time to watch out for things like mold and bugs as well just because at this point you're too far into flower to really be able to do anything about it so you want to make sure that you just maintain the optimum growing situation so your plant can really thrive right now right now it's really just about limiting any type of stress just catering tour it's kind of like a mother right before she gives birth you want to make sure that she's not stressing out so those babies in this case the buds are nice and healthy other than that you know from this point forward what I'll probably do over the next week is slowly but surely find bugs that look like they may have a problem holding up their weight and I'll go ahead and just find a way to support those just with some strings up to the ceiling example floods like this one here as you can see it's leaning pretty hard so you know chances are as it puts on weight over the next three and a half four weeks it will definitely need a little bit of support by giving it that support you allow that but to put on more weight and more weight once the the branch starts to weaken and be unable to hold the bud the plan isn't going to supply that much more energy to that actual bud site just because it's its way of its self-preservation it doesn't want to kill itself other than that like I said just make sure you maintain the proper conditions for your plan me personally I like to kind of switch my watering up a little bit right now stay consistent as far as the amount of times you water and when you water but trying to change up what you feed me personally I go from watering on a nutrient water schedule so I'll give it a neutral on Monday water on Tuesday newts on Wednesday water on Thursday so on and so forth and it kind of just gives it a little bit of a kickstart into the flesh cycle helps you slowly try to reduce some of those salts and some of that build-up so you don't you know totally shock your plant when you do flush it the first time and I've noticed by doing that it kind of I still flush at the end but it just kind of gives me a head start and it gives me a nice sweeter riper taste but I usually start that probably about week six and so I'll start that next week let me think yeah other than that man not really much talked about I do appreciate you guys tuning in as always this right here is the little girl she's on day 28 and she's coming along quite nice as well she's not gonna be no hyhy Guilder the main goal for this plant is I'm gonna let it go an extra week maybe an extra ten days really let those amber trikes come on and then I'm gonna compare it to the smoke from this girl saying that they're the same strand this is the mother this is the clone and it'll give me an idea of how I like this gorilla glue going forward just so I know if I prefer it to you know have the 63 day harvest over a 72 or what-have-you but I know 72 is a bit long for glue but I'm a real big indica guy I like some good nighttime smoke so even if this one turns out you know nice and ripe at day 63 I'm still gonna let this girl down here go an extra week or so just so I can have some good you know strong kick your ass indica bud plate that's it for this week's update go ahead and stay tuned for some blood shot and I will see you guys next week [Music]", "XiAIy7jttSc": "good evening everybody here we are day 28 the gorilla glue number four things are looking pretty good I had to put the net in here as they started to start to fall I should've got the net in a little sooner than I did but you know it is what it is so okay they got a little roughed up is all ah that's kind of them don't fall gotta come right back right back there it's kind of hard to see from here yeah broke didn't break it while it kind of super cropped itself well it's putting the net up but everything is things doing pretty good they're eating they're eating I think about 130 to 150 parts a day I haven't had any major issues another thing is a little concerning is it you can't if you can see these leaves a little bit of yellowing on the edges a little some spotting I've never really ran into this with Gorilla Glue but then again I've only grown grill glue in soil so this is kind of a a new ballpark for me we're just gonna see how it goes I inspected the roots the reservoir doesn't appear to be anything wrong downstairs it could be over Newt I don't know maybe just a little intense in this compact will tent but other than that they're stacking up and they're getting dense and they're definitely putting on the resin not bad at all and really good so we got you know another four or five weeks to go and you know hopefully these ladies will pull through hopefully nothing majors going wrong like I said with that that spotting issue look you can see a little better so we're just kind of play by ear see how they go other than that you know they don't seem to be negatively affected by it they're on schedule from looking pretty good for a week for two [ __ ] and due to that hopefully next week there's a you know have a more dramatic difference with it they've they've booked on quite a bit since last week so we'll just keep on keepin on and we'll see you guys next week thanks for watching peace", "puQVZuV9aMQ": "today is a day day 70 we are as you can see the lights are off this is Tuesday day 26 I believe the 26th and yeah it's midnight around midnight and I had no time to do it today earlier today so these plants were sleeping but we're going to wake them up and get it all done but before that I got in the mail today what this is well let me show got some stickers with it mash 7/10 calm that's pretty much that and some screams to put the weeding so as this whole rosin things coming together see this is the pouch where you put the weed in here or all the THC glands all the other crystals Keef whatever you want to call it they'll go in here you fold it and then in those two plates it gets smashed and everything all the juice comes out through this screen the screen is a 90 micron there we go see a 90 but so we got that I talked to the guys the dude Michael from rosin works and looks like I'm gonna be sending him some money for the controller this guy's a cool dude he tested out my coil that I had and I was going to buy a controller from high-five apes but apparently they wire their stuff to where only their coils work for their machine so you know rosin works doesn't work that way they they build a controller where any coil you have will work for that controller which it should be you know this guy Michael he tried out my coil he had to try out his controller and he also had the high five vape controller the one L is actually going to buy and he tried it on the high five ape and it blew out a fuse and I was like what imagine if I spent $300 and plug it in I just burn a fuse off of that thing so you know thanks to Michael for doing that for me and then he told me his machine does it just fine works just fine with my coil so that's what we're gonna do I mean you know why create a controller where only your products work for it you know it has to be universal you know what I mean man always give it up for rosin works so next week hopefully I'll have the controller maybe two weeks but right now we got the the screens we have the coils we have that the metal stainless steel plate now we've got putting the 20-ton press get this stuff out of the way start hanging them and we'll start doing the rosin so what we're gonna do is turn the light on see I've got all this stuff over here turn to there we go that's what we wanted to see alright so what we're going to do look at this one it's already falling off so we're going to do is just I'm a cut here some spots here and there just bring them down and let's do one let's see if I could set this all right now I had scissors so we'll see with these you kind of want to have a apart because we're gonna be hanging them on one of these things called coat racks coat hangers so in order to hang them upside down you needed like a a branch to have the thing to the copyright so I think we're good there or we could cut it a little bit higher I don't know I really is just cutting but you got to make sure you the cut let's try right there let's see how that goes I just bring it down whoa so let's take a look at that that is one branch of the gorilla glue right so what we're going to do is like grab one of these coat hangers just put them on top of right there about one of these like that see and one branch is done I will come and take out the fan leaves and let's just take up see had just one branches gonzo but uh let's try it out another one stretch this one gotta make sure it doesn't hit the lip red light keep forgetting about that but uh now we do the same thing well show this one gonna do pretty good so the other I like balancing them out I had another one another one but that's how you pretty much chop them down get ready to dry out so let's do this one right - let's do right there just kind of [Music] Oh not too not too shabby right okay okay so I'm gonna continue on doing the same thing with that I won't chop the rest of this and then I'll bring it back go to start chopping down this one so we could get rid of this scrog move everything out of the way I got a mini dehumidifier ready to go because all we need is air coming in a fan not hitting the buds but you know just creating a some wind inside so it's not stale air stale air and then I had a diminutive dehumidifier so I'll be right back by the time we come back this Gorilla Glue should be all hung up we'll be ready for the sunset sherbert good dokey", "SQvj5gmkX1k": "Jiji number four formerly known as gorilla glue number four

information I don't know my dog needs to be quiet guys are smoking along I said shut to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or your medical marijuana card I don't show you my personal information hey what's up guys Ronnie ray back at you so before this video starts I just want to say that I've heard you like a little high I'm pretty [ __ ] stoned actually I've been smoking all [ __ ] day I just want to get this video out for you guys so but yeah I have another card review so that's what we're doing in this video um if you guys see my last couple videos on them I did so I picked up like three different flavors or strains or whatever you want to call these of select elite premium very select elite premium babes you know what I mean um these are [ __ ] fire they're really expensive those seventy bucks for a [ __ ] the gram I usually don't buy them less they have the oldest and actually got a deal on these that's why you're seeing this video but this video but they won't go in this video we're doing the gorilla glue number four I redid the video on that great white shark that was really interesting go check it out if you haven't seen it I think it should be posted by now and a strawberry cheesecake that should be up by now - they're like some fiery cards but this is the same brand just the other glues number four I'm pretty sure by now like really close number four kind of like what mainstream like everybody knows what really blue number four is you know what I mean it's like fire strain supposedly people think I mean it is but just like the name has like a lot of height you know what that means so select elite premium bait cartridges gorilla glue number four 0% CBD really close to 91 percent THC so that's pretty potent in my opinion um again um it's like your first time watching one of my own review videos I always like want to say or I always say like I'm interested like to know like what you guys think about that cards and I want to hear you guys opinions too you know what I mean so if you guys like disagree or you agree with me or just anything you know I mean if you guys want to say anything just leave a comment because I read every single comment so I really loved the packaging on these carts and they just go into so much detail and I don't know it just really dope so I'll go over it real quick with you so the side of it it's just pretty simple just has the Arizona Department of Health Service wanting to know whatever and then I like this part a lot too the one bad thing is I don't have a select battery but I have a pretty good battery but if they want you to use this luck battery but I'm pretty sure they just say that so they you end up spending more money on their product you don't I mean but they have a such that they have a suggested serving which is like their recommendation of how long it should hit it forward and like if you do that um supposedly one three-second draw gives you about like three and a half milligrams of THC either pendant on which part you have so yeah and then depending on what cart you have obviously you can hit each part about 250 times if you follow like that three second draw rule and um each serving is about three and a half milligrams so yeah that's pretty cool to know this side is just pretty basic selectively what I mean pretty I like the logo it's pretty dope not I mean the bottom of it just has some more test results and the top says um no chemical additive added is just marijuana turfs Nathan flower grown a load a lowly sugar nitrogen potassium calcium magnesium phosphorus rosemary Miam Miam oils citrus yoga and amino acids oh so I guess it's supposed to be smart really clean overall you know what I mean so aside from that the price point being $70 that's one thing that I really don't like about it besides but I mean if you want a quality Carter you kind of gotta pay the price point being like quality this little like live resin or whatever you're using this expensive plus the Turks that high quality type so expensive and everybody has so many factors yeah I mean what that packaging on this I just love how it like that gives you a description of the taste how you're supposed to feel and just like all that [ __ ] when I read it you know what I mean so it says it's supposed to taste a little earthy a little pungent and a little like pine-sol anything pungent or skunky is like fire you know what I mean oh and supposed to make you feel relaxed happy in your work which is like that's exactly what I need right now since I'm a little baked if you guys can tell but usually you get three point six three five you get about three point six three milligrams with THC per hit if you follow it follow up that little serving instructions if that's even accurate and obviously no CVD so yeah so there's no CBD in it the product is made three nineteen twenty nineteen it was tested by C for laboratories tested on to twenty seven twenty nineteen so there's that for you guys to guys want to see that that's just a hop into this you guys haven't seen my last videos you just you guys can be dead if you want it says um especially elevate your medical marijuana enjoyment to a higher level what a luxurious through pine a therapy infuse cartridge this top-shelf cartridge Pat packs a powerful punch with our highest level activated medical THC and then if you guys want you guys can check out I think this is the website I don't know you know I never really good on the website they just have a random website right there I guess so I guess it has to be parents oh you can go check it out if you want more information having them my dog needs to be quiet I'm sad for that yeah right off the bat you open it up this [ __ ] looks fired as [ __ ] Oh make reader with that little message and that and then the card a elite Ali a select and that you guys can see that this is a hybrid so it's a little bit darker you and as you can see but it still has that really really good clarity to it fire looks like some fire oil there's the bio oil I really liked and all pieces and knock pieces are like really comfortable on your mouth I hit at least in my opinion that's like a personal preference I guess what yeah you see that bubble that [ __ ] is not moving this [ __ ] is like this [ __ ] it but really number four I think it's been a minute that's my little glue so pokey kind of hyped up into this hope you guys are smoking along you know you guys are smoking along with some anxious and fire oh if you aren't that's unfortunate I wish you guys had some fire but uh if you guys are smoking along that's dope but let's hop into this I guess this is what it looks like on depends make sure you go up on the pan and I'm using are just regular like I'm a sled a sky pen it's a dispensary by me but it's pretty dope I'm pretty sure like they just some company sells these on wholesale and a bunch of dispensaries just logo on it but it's pretty dope you can change the watts and [ __ ] on it and you can preheated so it's a pretty cool pen for the price if they charge for it but first off we're gonna have it on like 2 point 4 volts just to get like a little taste test and then we'll raise the bowls up a little bit more and get like more of like a smoke test and my cloud testing on I mean high test so let me preheat this [ __ ] up like I said I hope you guys are smoking long guys are ya and you guys love smoking along shoes Oh so yeah like I said I bet on like a low temperature setting but my whites are going out so sorry if the lighting goes bad in a second I might be like wrap this video up and should be a little bit better but I don't know how long that lights gonna last I gotta wrap this video up kind of fast um this if you guys went out with a ceasefire right off the bat um super potent super kind of pungent like they said pungent right here's know one of the words that used earthy pungent pine definitely taste some little plunging let me go back in for another hit I don't know how well the smoke is picking up on camera but it's Blanc allows to so definitely has I can taste that earth earthy like if you want to judge if you want to judge the taste or flavor by the description they gave 5 out of 5 so I'll say that's like right on point but it's not like the most tasteful car you obviously just like some fruity carts out there and [ __ ] but for how but when it is definitely [ __ ] fired the fuel relaxed happy in your word and I'm feeling pretty relaxed pretty happy pretty your fork you know what I mean so it's working I'll get like a four and a half out of five maybe five out of five let me turn the old sup up to like the taste taste is pretty good but I've had better better better tasting cards next is East is e is so potent so [ __ ] Pope win and so [ __ ] so tasty especially this Ron and I won if you haven't seen my strong and I review wants dizzy check that out but let's put this on like three and a half volts no like three point seven and I'll take like a blinker hit or two for you guys and I guess we can go to the hiya little bit more judge the smoke a little bit more yeah guys are smoking along with this edge here so let's go definitely hurts your chest from take a fat rib so the high definitely is a 5 out of 5 definitely feel it's not like I'll be able to have me on I mean but for a cart it's a fire car but there's nothing really like too special batter that stands out away from like the other two parts like these two ones so I haven't finished it but I'm just gonna give it the same reason I gave you it's a four and a half out of five like about pretty much everything there but with the price point about like 60 or 55 bucks instead of 70 I think I'd be like why not cuz it is pricey to make these so but I don't know just that that's a little bit like pricy in my opinion that's the only reason I give it a four and a half out of five besides for that it's like a perfect card of my opinion um well I mean I know this better call yourself better courts out there but it's still like on my top five list no I'm saying so yes besides for that let me know if I'm going the comments what you guys think of it and I'm if you guys have any other video ideas for me suggestions anything you guys want to tell me just leave them in the comments besides for that if you guys like this video give it a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] and besides for that Ronnie ray", "bINuUodlGTY": "what's going on you two first off I'd like to thank God for allowing me to embark on this endeavor here in Denver Colorado in today's episode we have another stream review from medicine man medical market and it is your will igloo number four now let me tell you how this strain I feel is really well-balanced it definitely gave me the head high as well as the relaxation of the body it's definitely one I can tell you you could smoke throughout the day as well as a nighttime stream without further ado let's go ahead and check out these buds check out the bones now these buds right here if they have a few small also I gives off that fake plant like I've given you no descriptive back in the past it definitely smells like you know one of those old fake plants that your grandparents would have on their you know mantle or you know just sitting around for years also it does have a nature smell just more like earth it smells like outside like woods you know you're going on to the forest it definitely has all those smells I mean it's definitely dense inside of there our way you smell quite a bit of pine as well like a Christmas tree another thing that I was surprising me is that this really has a sharp sharp lime stone but it's kind of like one of those lime smells that's you know it's so strong that it kind of like burns your nose it kind of have to rub your nose a little bit beyond that I mean it's really pretty I mean it really does shine let's go ahead and break it up see what the inside looks like yes let's see some now this dream really did have me uplifted when I first started smoking it it made me feel happy as well as you know relax like I said I'm very creative I like to draw on paint and this one really had me going it was definitely one that I could definitely smoke and just keep on drawing keep on painting and you know I was just painting nothing draw nothing you know we're just having a good time we're just relaxing and just lay my brain be itself and you know just going to work and drawing stuff this is definitely one that I feel like you can go ahead and take advantage on yeah you know in the event that she smoked quite a bit of it I'm pretty sure you would pass out but you know throughout the day I'll has really smoking quite a bit of it and it really wasn't you know making me sleep years more just you know relaxed body sensation as well as a good head high this one definitely is a spicy one the first hits are always really strong don't further ado let me go ahead and get a sample a little flavor see what it's talking about shine so bright get little piece I'm getting this piece I'm going to take a little smell as well as since I broke it open see if there's anything different Wow I smell orange juice kind of like Florida orange juice like really really uh really like the orange juice not like an orange but like the orange juice you know you drink it and it has that kind of I don't know how to explain it but it's it's kind of like that uh aroma to it you know it's a little different than oranges but it smells like orange juice also I get that feeling more like I was telling you about I really like to kind of compare it to like a I just a really strong cush you know how pushes have that fuel II smell something like that you know it's really tart you know sharp to the nose and definitely makes you feel like you want to rub your nose you know when I broke it open that lime smell kind of went away not really went away but it kind of just you know went behind and you know the real strong smell was actually data orange the whole introduced that I smelled go ahead and took a hit and see what it's talking about okay I definitely tastes like what is that a cereal golden crisp I don't know if y'all remember that cereal but golden Chris used to leave that little aftertaste in your mouth and also in the milk as well it would have some kind of like a 1/2 D taste I had fever I had to go home Chris that's exactly what I smelled you know I tasted on the exhale definitely it's really sharp but tickles your throat you know it has that fuelie sensation I like to give it like the same descriptive as a cush you know it really tickles your daughter it makes your chest kind of expand a little bit on the first hit it definitely went to my eyes but it made it more alert I can already feel my back kind of just uh you know just I feel like it's just letting loose a little bit I don't want to call it really pain relief but I do feel like dissipating on you'll just be intense I'm gonna go ahead and take a second pool on the second hit I really tasted like a maple bar I don't know if you've ever had one of those maple bars from like a bakery but I really tasted like a maple war also I do taste lime but it's not really like the lime itself it's actually just like lime peel it also has a little bit of a waxy sensation but it's not really like strong as most it is there but it's it's kind of like something where if you play around with your tongue like put it to the top of your the roof of your mouth you kind of do taste that sensation of having that waxy feeling the second hit I definitely definitely went to my tongue I can feel myself you know getting a little bit of the drunk talk but my eyes I mean they've wide open I mean I feel really excited I feel like I really want to go out and you know do something I really feel like you know the relief of like you know stress is going away and I really want to you know describe that as you know just like de-stress you know it isn't like pain you know just like you know you feel your body going numb in certain spots new it feels like you know just like relief you know to me go ahead and go Interpol I also taste like chard kind of like barbecue like you know you have a you know a piece of meat that's kind of like a little bit burnt like the burnt ends I have that char taste in my mouth and I don't think it's necessarily because I'm at the bottom of the the actual bowl because in reality it's still green I think it just it has that kind of like smoky taste you know what I mean it's kind of different definitely definitely taste pine now also a nerd thing that I do taste is lemon but it's not really the sourness of the lemon it's kind of like just that the fragrance of the neem and you know how a lemon it's kind of sweet as smell you know sweet plus a little bit of sour it's kind of that taste I definitely do feel it you know making me wanna you know be anxious you know I feel like I'm ready to do something possibly paint or you know just get on the computer and just you know YouTube it up you know go on a soul search for for nothing you know what I mean it definitely makes me feel like I'm ready to you know I have like plans you know I really don't have anything planned today but it feels like I have something due it's definitely a up feeling upbeat uplifting feeling and definitely one that I recommend for people that are trying to you know find something that'll make them a little bit happy I know you know what the whole medical scene you know they haven't really legalized it for the you know anxiety and depression but I do feel like this would be one that you would want to try you know in the event that you're looking for something that you know possibly can make you a little bit happier and more upbeat definitely definitely has a glow to it even without the light I mean this camera lady doesn't do it justice but if you are ever by the area of medicine man medical market feel free to stop in say hello go ahead and sample these buds if you have any questions or concerns on this [ __ ] here Halabja boy not you boys out cuz his tongue is already all slipped up and slurred up but I feel like I'm ready to go ahead and run a marathon pace", "UDKXFg1ymvg": "[Music] what is going on you [ __ ]

here welcome back just taking a look at our gorilla glue number fours they are in their last week to 10 days i would guess before harvest they look beautiful they smell beautiful those calyxes are just swelling right up rock hard nugs looking good here we are with the mutants our reason for being they look fine other than the fact that most of their leaves have three fingers and the the new growth um is all wonky so um i asked for some ideas and we got some and i'm actually going to implement just about everything that was recommended so one thing was recommended was uh too much light power so the root mass isn't enough to support the growth and it's getting too much light makes great sense like if you look at these plants that i only transplanted them a little over a week ago from their clones only the size of these bad boys look at that stem now i don't know what the root ball looks like but i can that makes real good sense to me that it's not really big enough to support something that's that large makes good sense they're still growing if you can see these lower i was telling you uh you know ideally we want to train and we're going to keep these guys down and let these guys catch up well they're getting there you can see they're heading up there so if we can straighten out the mutancy problem hey little fella you're in the wrong tent pal i'll go in the other tent here buddy come on all right just go over here up on there come on all right so what i'm gonna do i raise the lights as i said we're gonna we're gonna flush the plants as well and i'm actually going to check the runoff which i haven't had a chance to do yet i've only given them one real feeding where i i fed the whole pot and i actually didn't get that much ran off so i didn't bother to check but this time i will because we want to see what's going on here so what i'm going to do is take them to the sink one by one and really give them a good flush um so i'm actually going to steal steal these two things if you let if you saw my last uh grow update i was mentioning the springtails you can see them right there in every runoff now i assume they came in because i actually fed these girls american pride uh fertilizer organic amendments topsoil stuff that i was feeding the girls outdoors but my hydro guy said he uses on his indoor plants great for taste and smell so i decided i kept a little saved a little from outdoors and used it in here but along with that came these little critters apparently they're not much trouble but um i don't like seeing bugs you know i've had the aphids i've got these springtails the ladybugs are nice and fun but i will look forward to having no other critters in my tent hopefully i'll have that happen before summer so i'm just going to pour this out [Music] i just fed them uh watered them i should say because they are being flushed as we speak they just have their second heating so they've been flushing for two to four days that would be convenient if that stayed up there down all right let's see get him tiger all right i'm not sure i need that for all right let's start with this here we go off to the sink there we go now i've never actually done this this way okay uh gopro uh took a hiccup there so we're back all i've done is i uh pretty much fully watered with tap water i'll show you in the next one but i'm actually also going to pour some ph water through so i already i went through with tap water i'll show you in the next one but then i'm just gonna follow it up with some ph water just for fun oh i'm making a mess make sure i get some everywhere unless i've made i did fill these up pretty high yeah for plant these the size these these stems seem really thick and it makes sense you're starting with a clone they're pretty thick to begin with so we're getting a little discoloration there so maybe there is a soil issue here so this is good i'll give him a good flush why is that doing that so i poured tap water through them for a bit like gave them a pretty thorough drenching basically one minute or so and now what's this uh putting through another half dozen liters of ph water and after this i'm actually gonna feed them as well yet another tip that was given in the comments that i may as well try i can't hurt because i'm not certain what's going on so uh anything that made sense i'm gonna give a try here so that's that one ideally i would let it dry but i'd really like to take these videos in one straight shot so that's what i'm trying to do do you ever let this dry a little more tricky move here get everything completely wet here we go the first one one and oh i did this thing there we go and then this guy okay okay okay so just like the last one set this time with the gopro not fizzing out we're gonna do tap water give it a real good rinse with the tap water again a normal or regular flush i haven't normally done this so it's the first time i've actually brought the plant to the sink to give it a flush but to make sure we're giving a really good one i like the idea since it's relatively simple to do for me right now now let's flush this with some tap water real good flush all over smell that nice what is that lemony smell turn that up just a little expedite the process even a little more so let's give them a good rinse here what do you think birds what's a big dog let's see all right so i would guess that i do this for something like a minute and a half or two that's about what i think i'm doing here and that i would guess is enough to give it a pretty good flush out and then as you saw in the last one when i came back let's see i also gave the flush at this ph water just to rebalance the soil here um a gentleman in the comments mentioned using something called rebalance i meant to look it up i assume it's some kind of ph rebalancing thing not really familiar but um i don't have any so i'm just gonna pour some ph water through it after the tap water just to be sure and then i'm also gonna feed it with ph water and nutrients so again i should probably pause in between soakings here would probably work best soak it with the tap water let it uh run out like drain out and then soak it again probably is probably ideal but um i don't want to spend that kind of time so we're going to do it this way and this guy's getting more of the ph that's probably good [Music] all right all right i meant to bring those just let that drain for one second big dog hang out stay there okay all right let's bring her over so we are getting some five fingered leaves in the newest girl and that girl's having some trouble yeah she's funky looking see we can bring her around okay oh here we go [Music] all right let's go okay number two on there now those are soaking wet so we're dripping uh i did really want to check the runoff but [Music] if i do that now it's a great little uh item for a drain to waste or set up i guess you can find that combo really cheap like that was less than 10 bucks i think for those two quick and easy i'm getting some blue tinge i should uh probably give that girl some support for the next week like these do just wrap a string around them kind of hold them up hey big dog all right so to accurately test my runoff i would have to i would want to get some of this out otherwise it's just going to be diluted obviously sit back so you can get a better look at the mutations here they're all funky they're all funky for the most part so that's interesting it's interesting it's an interesting crow to choose to do live updates we'll see if we can bring them around yeah this might take some time well it's my friend what's the matter pal what's the matter big dog okay okay okay okay okay that is just gonna have to do we'll have to deal with a little a little water in our runoff okay let's get rid of this okay here we go my friend ready okay so we're going to feed them and that's going to be real hard to do the big one so we'll go with this guy where's the other one oh my am i making it is he spinning around like that i'll try to slow down where's the voila it's right here my friend why didn't you tell me okay straighten these babies out made a mess to keep a tidy ship straight them up should have done that at the sink because guess what i don't wash my hands last time i promised okay so now we flushed we flushed with tap water and then a little flush through with uh ph water ph to 6.2 and now we're gonna give it a nutrient feed so what this actually is i believe it's right around 7 50 ppm which is about normally my goal 760. perfectly fine but what it is is it's half mag and half base newts that's it base grownuts so that's all we're going with here nothing fancy half newts and plenty of cal mag again another recommendation there was no real qualification for that but you can never really go wrong for cal meg so i have no problem uh giving them an extra dose no like people mention it but didn't really qualify uh why it might be a thing but knowing that these plants love calmag we'll just give them a good dose and just make sure it's not the problem right easy uh this isn't the normal normally the way i would go about problem solving because it's not very effective i i'm effectively doing four things at once so i'm really not going to learn what the problem was really if it resolves itself because you know i flushed the soil gave it some calmag raised lights any one of them or any combination could have been the issue presumably my original assumption that it was somewhat like genetic in a way like i had cloned it this way um doesn't seem to really uh make a lot of sense necessarily but i really don't know what it would be still looking for answers um yeah i even struggled finding keywords to try to search what i'm seeing here then that's part of the problem like uh you know they're not it's they're not twisted tops that you know i tried folded like they're just odd they're just unusual looking right so i couldn't really find a picture exactly like it most of the most of the ones with um sort of twisted tops look more unhealthy than these like if it weren't for those twisted tops i mean they got a little bit of you know otherwise they look pretty healthy for the most part so [Music] that was why i think maybe i was leaning towards something from the cloning operation i somehow cloned some three-fingered mutants but hopefully it's just something in the cocoa or maybe it's gonna cal max gonna save it who knows but we will know maybe in a week or two see how this goes so how many was that three oh yeah i guess we're getting plenty of run out there i wasn't noticing it's quietly filling up there so that's almost half full yeah because this will basically run through so this is ph nutrient water already mentioned i don't exactly like this this runoff if i check the runoff here it's going to be a little wonky too i think just for the just for uh just for the process like ideally everything's dry and you just do a normal feeding and all the nutrients pass through your medium and then you measure the runoff and it's can be a little more accurate and maybe a little more useful some people question how useful measuring runoff is um i think it gives you a bit of an idea at least an indication i can sort of indicate of problems be indicative of problems so we have uh i i mentioned i raised my light which is a mars hydro sp 250 for anyone that doesn't know it's um it's supposed to be a 240 watt light with a little ir a little uv kind of thing um so i did raise it looks like we're at about probably three feet i just want to make sure we're not stressing the plants so that was a very good idea if i wasn't so lazy i'd dim them but we'll just go with raising them for now and uh and i have one of them in operation hopefully and ideally once we get uh some growth here we'll fire up the other one so we'll have the two and hopefully we'll grow a nice canopy of big fat juicy buds beautiful rock hard gorilla glue number four buds like those ladies over there you see those they're getting swole baby they're so frosty look at that i've been i haven't grown anything that's uh so frosty just love looking at them all about the tricombs baby man oh man those plants outside are so big like that is just crazy pants how big they are like just looking at it looking at those plants all the stems and all the buds yeah for sure there's a you know there's at least double that or triple in every one of those plants outside i think assuming they finish to some degree i don't expect well some of the buds are getting pretty big i don't know if we'll get them quite that large but close i think on uh on the best plants on the best buds and the other ones as long as they're big enough to be processed that's uh that's fine with me oh [ __ ] it's so quiet i'm not paying attention so because they're soaking wet this everything i'm pouring through is going right through but it's hopefully uh replacing the uh ph water they already run through and replacing it with this now you know what i believe i believe i have a second one of these things oh it's just 40 no it's normally not this much trouble only a little more slick but so let's check this run off just for fun i don't know what it's going to be like yeah so there you go plenty of water that's fine even if that were accurate i don't know how accurate it is i mean that's just plenty of water in there same thing with the ph i don't think it's going to do as much good to check i think next time be interesting if it's a little high okay that's all right interesting it's accurate or not at all really the next time i feed them is the best time to be checking the runoff right now they're just full of water and whatnot so that's it this is uh basically implementing the tips i received in the comments which was raise the light or dim the light which i've done flush them good idea which i've done and uh give them a shot of kyo mag which i've done and here we are so that should be at four i don't imagine i'll have to do another one of these i just again i'm recording every task so whether it's in three days or two weeks so i won't necessarily need another one until uh i don't know what would be next necessarily i guess we're still just waiting for some kind of change in the in the tops here to see if we get some some proper growth because they're all funky but otherwise it's okay assuming that we can pull it out here so that's that raised the lights flushed them cal magged them and we're good to go for a few days so that's it one last look at the beautiful gorilla glues can't wait three weeks or so before they'll be two weeks secured and ready to taste look we're getting some blue in there already all right that's it for now go pro stop recorded", "gZyBoM9crfc": "what's going on everybody welcome back here we are end of week three now day 21 finally caught up on on weeks here so to speak as you can tell the ladies are doing well they've stretched quite a bit step back here you can really get an idea so this is seven foot ten Sousa you know it's my garage eight and a half foot or so and yeah they've stretched a ton very big plants from the scrub here let's see you know there's a good foot another good foot so they've stretched at least two feet above the canopy here hopefully they don't get any taller they shouldn't have grown this before and usually we stop stretching right right about now about about the end of week three start at week four by the end of week four it should be be completely done stretching we might see a little bit more here there a few an inch or two more possibly than that the ladies are doing fabulous they're eating well drinking well doing weekly reservoir changes running the advanced nutrients pH perfect and they just eat it up as you can tell beautiful-looking ladies I'm really anxious to see how they how they're gonna look in about a month from now but yeah now everything's going good thanks for checking it out you know we'll just keep on keepin on see you guys next time peace", "Mv7vRHv1w-0": "what's up everybody its Canadian into a girl coming at you again we're doing a deep water culture system here this is what I do for vegging my plants getting them ready for my bigger systems here this is how I like to do it it doesn't mean that it's the best way whatever so as you can see I'm filling up in this bucket with water and I've got air going in there I've got two airlines in there cuz I can right now the pump but uh yeah it's gonna have two airlines in there sitting in a bunch of water that's water's coming from my flexpro tank and you know that's 60 gallons thereof just ready for dechlorinated aerated water there so we're gonna fill her up so that the basket is gonna be sitting the bottom of the basket is gonna be sitting in water so we're gonna bring it up to the boat here and then we got our 6x6 rough little cube that's just resting in water I mean you got to do that and flush it and flip it around flustered around a little bit and pH water I mean it's I got really good pH water and I just do this a few times in a row and it works really well so yeah so as you can see we've set it up just with a little bit of water at the bottom of the basket here about an inch sitting down there we got our rock wool blob that's ready to go in there so we're just gonna drop that kind of like that [Music] and don't forget to take off the plastic [Music] so I got my next gorilla glue here going from seed this is about a week old or so so all I'm gonna do pop that right in the center there just like that so that can grow into that block like that and then I'm gonna take my three rings I washed all this hydrogen and everything prior [Applause] just kind of fill it up around the rockwool [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] until we get the desired effect so as you can see I'll just build it up nicely like that [Music] there we go there's a deep water culture set up all ready to go so now that thing's gonna live in there until it's ready to go into that tent there", "m7hWVFeKWo0": "greetings fellow humans suburban herb here and welcome back we're just taking a look at the gorilla glue number fours and they're looking good baby all right they're thickening up stacking up and still looking pretty healthy so yeah other than our little skinny mini here everybody else they're looking thick baby that's not why we're here we're here for these ladies you saw the last video the last video was exactly uh one week ago i believe so seven days they've come quite a ways since on that day we just watered them and we clipped off the really damaged leaves and we've got some more clipping to do today a couple things um so this video will be in two i recorded a watering uh three days ago uh or at least the mixing of the nutrients i'm gonna put that at the start of this video and then uh i'll follow that with the work that i do here um i'll only do it once or when i change my nutrients i understand it's probably boring for most people but i also recognize that there's going to be the few people that will actually like to see someone doing it so i'll do it once and i'll put that at the start of this video and then after that the work that i do on these two right my friend you ready are you gonna help all right let's do it gopro stop recording and i've yet to do this so i will do it right now and today we gotta feed them last time when i fed them uh everything was all ready i already had a batch mixed up so i'll just walk through a batch here once and we'll never have to do it again here we go so this is for my two little clones they're i don't know a couple weeks from rooting or less i'll check that out we'll see what uh see what the number actually is it might be two weeks it might be a little less i don't really remember that one she's stuck all right so uh i probably need about four liters three to four liters it's really hard to make that amount so i'm gonna make eight meters and i'll save some to use later i'm using this system here and we'll go through it again from a local company apparently quite big in the uk they export a lot there so if you're in the uk you might be able to find this stuff seems pretty good but i don't know i don't uh i don't i'll leave it at that so they have this seedling and transplant food let's start so um i'm embarrassed to say that i'm not exactly sure what's in here which is unfortunate but they don't really tell you what the ingredients are and i haven't asked but i would kind of like to know because that's kind of where i would like to go with my nutrients it's kind of knowing exactly what i'm putting in and why so as a companion this says three milliliters per liter uh there's eight in here so that would be 24 but i'm not gonna do 24. i'm going to do half of that so that was 12. i should have just for uh curiosity's sake just taking that check the bpm of my water my tap water just to show you but very often uh it's normally in between 75 and 115 so they're at 174 after having added that let's start stuff 174 so with these clones um i'm going to be going up to anywhere near uh 1700 or 700 ppm no more so these are b vitamins and this particular brand at least these don't seem to add much to ppms so um that's not a concern this is the same deal this is actually four milliliters per liter as a companion i'm going to do the same thing i'm gonna oh i'm basically just using half why um i honestly can't tell you i'm not really sure seems like the right thing to do so that's that actually we will check the ppm just for curiosity's sake when i started out i would do this to try to see what each different bottle added to the bpms to get an idea but once you've gone through it once you don't need to do it again if you know what i mean so we're at 200 basically that added 25 units so very little so we're at 200 so we're looking for about 500 more and in this case um i don't really know what that means so for these i believe they are four milliliters as well um so these guys are nice enough to show you a target ppm and a target ph so the target ppm is 750 target ph is 6.1 target ppm i definitely don't want to exceed that we're because we're talking like very young babies and they still look pretty fragile so i'll go 700 max but anywhere in there between 6 and 700 is what i'm aiming for i got 8 liters these are supposed to be four per so that'll be 32 we're not going to do that because we added those other supplements which took about 200 ppm or a little bit less plus whatever was in the water to begin with so that said 32 we do not want let's see if we could use 20. might be pushing it because maybe not let's see wait for you leave that open just in case i need to add more and 20 more from here this is a two-part system that's why i'm going from the two and a lot of systems do work that way okay [Music] real quick so 600 to 700 i guess uh what am i gonna guess i'll type it in 20 i'm gonna say let's say 7 30. i think i did good give myself the benefit of the joke come on baby 787 778 that's pretty darn close but because i don't really want to be over i don't need to be there's no reason to push my max newt value i'm just gonna throw in some cold water digga digga diggy dig so if i add say 10 percent more water i think that was a little more but it should bring down and does bring down the ppm i'll say 10 less say see if how my theory holds out i don't know if that was 10 or what but so we brought her down about 8 percent so let's pretend i put in eight percent of water what was that 72 good enough let's do it let's try it out i don't mind doing that recommended is 750 ppm we got 722 not to mention part of that is in the tap water i don't know if that makes a difference ppm anyway but here we go so that's it for nutrients but now of course we have to check ph critically important as is i learned a very hard lesson this year it cost me a few weeks of grief but uh calibrate your units baby uh i know i didn't buy uh calibration solution with when i bought the cheaper sets because uh you know there's a reason i was buying the cheaper sets i was trying to save money but uh i don't know i think it's pretty important so if i were to buy a cheaper set i think i would definitely get some calibration solution with it and check it bi-weekly at the at the most at the longest so we got 6.5 in our 8 liters 6.4 even now we need some ph down we're looking for 6.1 we have 8 liters 8 liters so i wouldn't put more than two drops i think i think there's probably more but let's see let's see that's why it's tough with a shorter smaller amount of water less trying to do like three or three or four liters for example drop a ph you can just send it flying so two drops moved at one seemingly ish and i'm just going for around 6.1 so i'm comfortable and happy to add one two three four and anywhere around six or six point one wouldn't make them a happy you know and then we can call it prepared [Music] i got six one perfect i'm a rock star that's it there you go how long does that take 10 minutes kind of i mean it takes a little time it just doesn't take no time okay there we go ph my friend pipettes i think these are called i was trying to remember last time maybe they're good for droppers okay that is ready we're gonna use this to do the pouring here we go [Music] hello ladies the gorilla glues quick peek they are they're finding up baby a little stacking up looking pretty good and frosty and they smell delish so yeah looking good as are these ladies so it's been a week since we've been here we did gave him a little clip and we gave him a little water i've been waiting patiently uh two days ago i came in and i gave them a water and i was hoping on that day to top them because i'd really like to top them sooner than later so as you can see they're pretty tall already they were clones as you may recall so i've been sort of waiting until i could get a good access to this top baby here without doing damage to uh these girls which you're gonna need to take over so it looks i can get in there now and this one here is similar i'm not gonna have a nice tee though they're gonna be staggered a bit i think if that's where i top them and also look at this mess down here uh we're gonna see if there's anything we can do with that we'll definitely get rid of that uh otherwise i'm not sure what else to do there it doesn't seem like they're providing much use this little bit of foliage down here i don't know about clipping them too much right now but i probably should yeah there you go it's always like that like do i don't i and in this case i'll probably uh do a little of in between i'll take a little off and i'll leave some so in other words i won't make a real decision but uh so this is what we're gonna do let's just the other thing that i'm gonna do my friend hey that's enough that's enough buddy i gotta work no i gotta work though what we're gonna do here i'm also gonna top them up a little bit these are very tall so uh i'm gonna stick a little more cocoa on top there just because i happen to have some so why not and it's already uh mixed with perlite and buffered with cal mag so it's all ready to go no reason why i can't top these up a little bit a little more stability let's do that topping my friend you're gonna have to move just for this because it's a little bit tricky you know so here we go let's get rid of this off okay blitz steal the way pal so here we go right in there is where we want it easy peasy one and okay when we get going here now i get that now i'm confused yeah that's him in there let's see oh i kind of hate to clip them see it's just so delicate when you're clipping and trying not to get those little fellers and in this case i'm not sure i can even do that i want to mess with this i thought they were ready let's see like we're gonna do it anyway we're just gonna go in there and clip right there again and i'll live with the consequences because today is the day oh poor little feller can i do it i really don't want to leave it let's see yeah we're going to go for it i'm just gonna go right in there and go for it try to avoid those two little colors on the right okay we shall see how that works i would normally wait till it's a little more clear um what you're clipping in this case i don't want to wait so we'll see hopefully they're fine we are also over here we're gonna take off some of this mess wow wowza funky funky stuff i don't know if this is common with clones because they are my first but um blitz my friend how come you want to help so much today buddy i'd really like to get rid of a lot of that i don't want to let's that's not helping my friend okay out of the way i really don't know what to do about those oh okay that's i don't know why you're so persistent today my friend this one here let's dude why why do you feel the need to help so much too buddy i'd rather you didn't no thanks let me go to the hell pal lay down for a bit okay that's horrific that is horrific okay i don't know what to do with them frankly so i think i'll leave them and see what happens okay all right that's done topped hopefully that was slightly painful now i'm gonna fill them up and give them a little water too much all right let's see what we got here so let's fill her up so this should settle a little bit to give me a little room in the bag for water excess water and what not watering i think should be okay i hope not completely sure but hopefully there are a lot of finger crossing here in my garden all right yeah they're messy looking i'd kind of like to do something with those things but i shan't for now let's leave them messy not super duper healthy looking really like not tragically unhealthy but [Music] could be better but they look all right they look alright a little bit mutant like not photo perfect plants right at the moment okay [Music] good pretty sure i will be cleaning those up but i'm just a little unsure what to do about it right now i'm just gonna give them a little feed [Music] and well we're here so i mixed this three days ago when i came in hoping to top i just ended up feeding so um i'd like to reuse it ppm's of 712 that's perfectly okay with me 21 degrees celsius also a-okay the ph is where it can go a little harae if i think it's the water if you get some evaporation then your ph will change so anywhere around 6 or 6.1 would be just groovy effects shown [Music] very good so it's good to go it's been sitting there for two days it seems fine to me i'm perfectly okay with that now there's only three liters here so they're just getting a liter and a half each last time i gave them two liters which i will do normally but this is just what i have left over so we'll give them a liter and a half each today and probably feed them again day after tomorrow let's see so i have a liter and a half make sure i get the whole area it's one liter for you my friend hey my friend it seems your eyes are troubled all right so there we go almost a full liter left so we'll go happy hope that topping works out not quite as clean as i like but i'm slightly impatient with these see how that works every opportunity is an opportunity to learn every mistake is an opportunity to learn i've learned a lot in my mini grows my few girls i should say this would officially be maybe my fifth or sixth growth you count like the simultaneous grows where i grew some autos at the same time i was growing some photo periods and growing outside at the same time as growing indoors but it's literally been one year since i bought this equipment and started growing so that's my excuse for killing 18 out of 20 potential clones but i think i learned the lessons we'll see you next time i try but i think it should go a lot better so there got to feed we topped them up topped up the cocoa a little bit just to give them a little more stability top them not ideally but it's okay you remember i was talking about how thin the leaves are the newest set or flight slightly thicker kind of fascinating though uh what the reason was and this mess down here i'd like to clean it up but i'm gonna leave it for now and that's about it for these for now what's up next well training is is first off so as soon as we're getting some growth here we're gonna be wanting to pull them down stuff really bothers me i don't know what to do about it get any ideas stay or go should they stay or should they go i don't know either but uh yeah that's it for now training's next on the agenda we're watering every couple days i'm feeding full strength newts and um that's it otherwise just in case anyone cares right now they're sitting under one mars hydro sp 250 at full strength and probably i think that's 36 inches ish it looks like about if i were smart because they're dimmable i would put it at you know 50 percent and lower that'd be probably the smart thing to do for smart people so if any smarts out there you might do something like that save yourself some smart money i'm not that smart so that being said um yeah we'll have another video in about a week can you smell that these girls are a couple months away from that ish there you go that's it for now see you next week gopro stop recording gopro stop recording", "xMG9dp6idww": "[Music] welcome to the world

non-profit that helps medical cannabis patients with medicine costs patients with serious conditions struggle to afford medical cannabis no patient should have to stop using medical cannabis due to cost all patients who need medical cannabis should have affordable access to it today i'm discussing three medical marijuana strains that all have primate-inspired names and are very well known effective medical strains an indica grape ape a 50 50 sativa indica hybrid gorilla glue number four and an indica dominant hybrid gorilla glue number five i'll discuss their typical effects and conditions they commonly treat so let's look at these popular strains all medical marijuana patients should be aware of thc and cbd ratios strain types and the medical uses of all cannabinoids and terpenes and cannabis this will help you choose an effective strain that treats your medical symptoms with or without intoxication and with effects that meet your lifestyle needs you can find in-depth resources and free downloads to aid you in choosing a medical strain using the links in the description this is the most important part of successful medical marijuana treatment the strains i discussed today can give you an idea of the effects similar strains with similar makeups will produce these are the effects that most people feel when using these strains which could vary for any individual based on our unique endocannabinoid systems and medical needs these are also the conditions patients say they effectively treat with these strains and certainly not the only conditions they are able to treat the first strain grape ape is an indica strain like a typical indica strain it is very relaxing sedative and increases appetite it is best used at night and will probably induce sleep grey babe offers the deep body relaxation typical of many pure indica strains grape ape tastes like grape bubble gum or kool-aid contributing to its name it has twenty percent thc and less than one percent cbt with this twenty to one thc to cbd ratio it would produce euphoric high effects in the form of a sedative body high grape ape could benefit any condition that needs full body relaxation and improved mood appetite or sleep patients have reported success in treating pain insomnia decreased appetite stress fibromyalgia arthritis anxiety depression post-traumatic stress disorder and cancer treatment or chemotherapy side effects with grape ape of course these are not the only conditions and symptoms grape ape could treat the next strain is gorilla glue number four which is a 50 50 hybrid strain it is a very potent medical strain that won't require much for medication gorilla glue number four has earned many different awards including first place in the 2014 la medical cannabis cup gorilla glue number four is a 50 50 hybrid that gives more relaxing feelings it was given the name gorilla glue because the scissors became stuck or glued together when trimming the plant gorilla glue number four has been developed into other strains as well including the next strain we will talk about gorilla glue number five it has 28 percent thc and less than one percent cbd with this 28 to 1 thc to cbd ratio it is very potent and will produce euphuria gorilla glue number four is a relaxing strain that is best used at night and may induce or improve sleep 28 is on the high end of thc percentages in flower strains so this strain should be used with caution for new patients or those who need to establish a thc tolerance gorilla glue number four could benefit any condition that needs body relaxation nighttime relief improved moods appetite or sleep patients have had success in treating depression arthritis bipolar disorder stress pain insomnia headaches migraines obsessive-compulsive disorder decreased appetite nausea muscle spasms and sleep disorders with gorilla glue number four but it could treat other conditions as well the last strain gorilla glue number five is an indica dominant hybrid strain similar to gorilla glue number four this may be because they are related gorilla glue number five is related to gorilla glue number one and gorilla glue number four it is a very relaxing indica dominant hybrid with more like a pure indica effect gorilla glue number five is relaxing sedative and associated with couch lock the feeling of not wanting to leave the couch it is another potent strain that offers deep body relaxation improved sleep and increased appetite gorilla glue number five produces very happy euphoric feelings without negative side effects it is another potent strain that won't require much for medication gorilla glue number five has up to 28 thc and less than one percent cbd similar to gorilla glue number four it has a 28 to 1 thc to cbd ratio that will produce euphuria in the form of happy hungry feelings with full body relaxation typical of many indica and indica dominant hybrid strains gorilla glue number five is said to be one of the best strains for pain sleep and muscle relaxation it could benefit any condition that needs nighttime relief muscle relaxation improved appetite sleep or mood patients have found success in treating alzheimer's disease stress relaxation pain insomnia a lack of appetite headaches and migraines with gorilla glue number five but it could certainly treat other conditions as well these three relaxing potent medical strains can give you an idea of the effects similar strains would produce always consider the individuality of a strain in its unique cannabinoid and terpene profile choose a medical strain with cannabinoids and terpenes that will treat your medical symptoms also consider thc and cbd ratios for the level of euphuria that you want and strain

gopro stop recording so i am getting ready to flip and i've just flushed these plants so basically what i did to flush is i ran two uh almost full 20 little buckets through these two plants just run them through empty run through and through and now i'm going to just because i have some and i did it last girl i'm going to add a tiny little bit uh of this um organic amendment it's fox farm american pride all this kind of delicious stuff um and i literally have exactly one cup left so this is just leftovers that i was using outside on the organic grill i have literally exactly one cup so what i think i'll do is i'll use that in two uh two feeds or something i'll do i'm gonna do one now and then i'll do another one uh in a few weeks so i'm just going to i don't you can see it doesn't really matter because i'm going to spread it around but i'm just sprinkling out a little bit that's a little weak but let's go with the tablespoon sprinkling around baby we're supposed to be using half of this how many tablespoons in a cup well okay okay and do the same on this side so i'm like three tablespoons looks like which looks like it's a fair amount it's basically enough to just give a sprinkle over the entire top and third tablespoon over here and that that'll leave us one more dose and we'll give it okay i'm just gonna put that back in there for the next one right blitz it smells like poo doesn't it smells like bat poo okay that's done not quite actually so i'm just going to massage massage it in a little bit into the top inch or so if you can and one thing that a top dressing will do is it'll get the roots to actually come up to grab some of that deliciousness so the guy i get my nutrients from says he uses both his uh liquid synthetic nutrients and he'll use this amendment top dressing i think he said normally just in uh in during the flower period i'm not exactly sure but um i used it last girl for my uh the uh real glue number fours that i just harvested and uh that seemed to be fine so i just thought i'd try it again since i had a little left so before i do this swap this out just in case because so now they've been flushed i just uh did that little top dust mixed it around a little bit now here i have a little bit of water with a little bit of calmag in it just to top this off i've just got what is that uh eight liters or something i'm just gonna give them a couple or a few just to flush that um the amendments down here so we'll just give it the one silver all around because they've just been flushed all around for everybody okay spread the love over here for a bit you always are gonna love this some fertilizer that you haven't had yet and then uh when this when these pots dry out in a couple days i will start the flowering nutrients because starting tonight or tomorrow the next uh light phase uh we're gonna be flipping these to the 12 12 flowering schedule and we're gonna start to create some flowers okay i hadn't really uh intended to record all this i just want to capture the top dressing since as i said i want to record just about everything that i feasibly can during for this entire grow so that's that for that but i'll be back with some more fabulous and wonderful stuff gopro stop recording okay we're back so it's been exactly one week since the previous video and five days since that first part of this video so uh during those couple days you saw what i did i flushed and then i added those amendments so here's where we sit five days after that or one week after the last video so as you might be able to notice we've obviously or certainly done a bit of stretching get down here a little bit we're getting a fair amount of foliage there it looks like uh the tall ones are getting close to 18 inches there of uh foliage so we're getting a pretty good canopy there we're definitely getting some stretch it's been a week i don't want to stretch too too much i just realized that uh we barely got that's not even 12 inches i don't think from our highest guy there so uh we're gonna have to raise the lights i just noticed only about five inches so we should be fine but there's not gonna be a ton of room because um i gotta raise them already now because we're already seeing a little bit of a little bit of leaf curling here tiny little bit i think so probably a little bit hotter than they'd like so i am going to raise them there's no reason i can't do that this very second i want to make sure that they have at least something like at this at this point uh you know you know at least 15 16 inches kind of thing so where are we we're a week into flower [Music] now if you saw the condition of these plants a week ago i was a little worried they weren't looking that great i wasn't exactly sure i had uh mentioned that there were some leaves with some uh rust spotting i can't even find those leaves now because frankly uh they're no longer relevant hello are you backing that dog so they are it's no longer relevant because uh you may not even notice the difference but huge difference and we're owe it all to that uh top dressing that i gave them so for whatever reason they were definitely lacking they were having uh they were deficient in something and uh clearly the the amendment the top dressing took care of it they just perked right up now we're all uh praying and everybody's happy so they were clearly deficient in something unfortunately i'm not really exact sure what it was you know oh don't go in the lights dude get off the light oh uh yeah so they were clearly deficient but they're happy now so um i i wish i could tell you what it was because i i wish i knew myself and i don't really all i know is they were deficient and now they're not they're looking a lot better so um this is the second week what's happening this week um not much it's um we're filling in there i could definitely be doing a little bit of trimming here but i'm just gonna leave it like just slight bit of defoliation we wanna you know there's some guys there that could definitely uh use some opening up here but i think what i'll do is i'll wait another week one more week let them stretch up and then we will uh give them a good defoliation and uh yeah third week we'll also be looking at possibly giving them uh a little bit of bloom boost but uh that's a week in the future and for now let's go down and take a look i could probably do a little more cleaning up underneath here as well i didn't do as well as i should have in the back there it's kind of hard to get at it's part of the reason why i use i grow a 4x4 space in my 6x4 tent because i like the side elbow room here you got the side doors and it's fine but um i don't know i like my i like my space but it's also kind of fun to go wall-to-wall green which is the first time i've done it and uh yeah so far so good so that's it i think i'm going to raise that light giving them at least as i said 15 inches bloom newt's coming up we're gonna defoliate uh probably yeah i'll probably defoliate for the next video and that's it i wanted to show you the clones that we're doing next door here but i just realized yep they're sleeping so uh we'll save that for next time so that's it for now we're in our second week of flower and uh we'll see you next week go pro stop recording", "vzbr1jrBXr8": "greetings fellow humans suburban herb here and welcome back to my little world it is day 16 of flower and here we are so effectively we're in the middle of week three so what have we done since the last update the only real changes you may recall last time i did a lot of pruning slash defoliation mostly pruning and the only other thing that i've changed is uh in my nutrient i have uh added bloom booster so the last two feeds i added actually two different balloon boosters for no particular reason it's just the way it worked out i was going to use can of 1314 which i've used in the past and i did use it for one feed and i was going to use it for another but then decided to go with the bloom booster that comes with the nutrient system that i'm actually using so uh it's actually a powdered so i i just added a smidge of that for the last feed so here we are um you can see they look pretty healthy we're getting some butt action we're in the third week so it's reasonable but of course i have concerns and those concerns are pretty much the depth of the canopy which you can see is there so the depth and the fact that it's not um what would you call it even parallel uh neither of those words work but you know what i mean so what i actually did so i we had two outliers uh last time they were about here and they were well above four inches above the others so i actually pinched them down as a little test uh and this one pitched down quite nicely i actually got the pinch right brought her down to level with all the others and uh she's fine this one here i pinched a little too hard so i sort of broke the stem so she's falling a little bit needs a little help to stay up but she's almost got what she needs but anyway that was just a little test to bring her down but in the meantime those around are sort of sprung up especially those two wieners in the back so i don't know if i should do something about those like i said day 17 of flower i worry it's a little late to be doing any kind of um high stress training uh but i don't know maybe it's the right thing to do because otherwise the canopy would be relatively even at about here like not great we got some deficits here in the corner but that's my doing i'll try to learn from that the way i did the branches but otherwise those two in the back i might have waited to bend these down till the end of stretch which clearly hadn't happened yet because those girls they were down here i don't know if this had some me taking these two down had something to do with those two gaining uh prominence not sure so here we are what i'm going to do so the reason i'm updating is i'm going to defoliate a bit uh i mentioned concerns my concerns is the depth of the canopy and its unevenness and these lights getting down here um because uh you know my only experience is with the tsw tsl sorry these here and they do a really good job and they're more powerful than these sp 250s and i think that they would have an issue with really getting good um good strong power value down you know 12 inches into this canopy so anyway that's my concern what we'll do about i'm not sure i you know constantly learning and uh you know although this was a bit of my objective it might have been a little silly to have left all of these uh branches down here some of them are smaller than they should be i could probably still clip them but i don't want to stress these girls out too too much but one good thing about that like there are a ton of branches and i do worry about getting enough nutrients to all them whether i can get enough through these five gallon pots to all of these tops but one thing that gives me a little hope is if you look these branches are pretty thick like these a lot of them i should say not all of them but a good portion they're pretty good size so they're going to be able to move those nutrients pretty good like if you look they're they're pretty thick now we got some slightly thinner ones these ones out here which probably should have been gone you know like there's certainly too much but uh i don't know we'll see we'll see how it goes it's all uh test you can see we're up within five inches six inches with those back two and that's troublesome i imagine see we're starting to get you probably can't see a little bit of leaf uh tackling so they're just bending up in the center there but otherwise they look super healthy they're all praying you know they're having a little uh bloom boost party maybe but you know i i was and am slightly concerned with the secondary buttage down so that is why i decided to sort of boost the bloom boost as it were so in the past normally i've done it once in the third week sometimes once in the fifth week ish um but this time because i wanted to definitely promote non-growth i want to promote flowering as opposed to promoting any kind of growth any kind of more stretch so therefore the focus on the bloom boosting which will put you know seemingly presumably you know more for phosphorus and potassium which is going to uh focus more on growing your flowers and not your stems and branches so hopefully the stretch is over i think i will do something with those two the canopy is okay it's not super duper level we'll see how that works out it might be a bit of an issue with these lights so i'm going to do a little defoliation not much but you can see we're we're thick back there and even down in here like this guy there's no reason there's um you know there's a lot of leaf if you look we've got plenty of leaf up here on these plants so some of these bigger ones if they're underneath and especially if they're blocking something like that um very often leaves that are pointing in like this one here for example i uncomfortable leaving a lot of the upper leaf but this one here it's pointing in and therefore covering like it's pointing towards the light it's clearly covering some underlings get rid of that guy too because when i i did the last defoliation four days ago it did open up the uh the canopy nice so we could see through it we could get some air there's still issues oh like i i came in here when i opened up the tent this morning anytime you can find like a leaf on top of another and and water in between uh that's an indication if it's happening all over it's an indication to me that there's there's too much leaf overlapping um and there's not enough air movement or there's just too much leaf like uh there's an issue that you wanna address one indication this guy down here he's kind of soggy he's definitely covered by all this like if any light is getting through it's very little plus he's a bigger leaf older and less efficient and like i said there are um there's still plenty of leaf so i don't know i'm a defoliator and become a defoliator until you know unless someone can convince me differently so these guys that i brought down it was an interesting little test but it's not ideal so any place where it looks like it's congested like back in here you got to get rid of a couple of these and even those big guys back there it's got to go so i'm going to keep defoliating and i'll come back and show you the end results and but before i do that let's skip over here oh and let's take a look at the cloning situation we got a ladybug visiting from the tent next door hey little fella here come here i need all you guys in my fight against the aphids find out come on there you go all right there you go all right there are nine clippings in here so let's take a look 85 degrees 75 percent so i just actually watered them a few hours ago so within the same lighting period now so far this is the underperforming end that might be a little soggy so those four so those four are uh so far rootless and these five all have some form of roots oh that one's just starting to get one out the bottom you can see one on top um this one has some rootage there some roots coming up bottom this guy come out the side so once the roots appear how long can one wait before one wants to transplant and here's the first one for roots to appear and she still got the most and you can tell by kind of tell by the way your foliage is changing so there you go five are rooted routine four so far have not they look okay reasonable so back to bed kids there we go back to business back to defoliation all right so that's that that's the update i'll come back and give you a look after a little defoliation we're just going to open up that canopy i wonder what the general consensus would be on on actually bending those there you're at my like my outliers to try to even the canopy as i said i already did it whatever i should do with those girls so part of the reason i did for those two as i kind of had an open space which i didn't really end up feeling but uh that was part of the idea same thing with those i might be able to fold them back but whether i should or not i'm not completely certain pretty sure i could just bend them to lower them and maybe that's what i should be doing we'll see okay uh i'll be back in a couple minutes to show you the damage gopro stop recording so there we go day what'd i say 16 17 uh 16 i think a little defoliation we've been on bloom boosters for two feeds i'm actually going to i'm going to be checking runoff but i may continue with a small continuing dose of bloom boost for about the next week or i may just do one bigger one because i'm really trying to focus on these buds now um yeah i don't know if it's actually the right move i'm not over feeding them i'm not giving them high levels of ppms i'm just giving them more on the bloom side that's all um and mostly because i'm trying to focus on these buds yeah other thing that i wanted to mention last thing was i raised this light a few inches i'm gonna have to do the same there and i'm gonna make the decision about uh those two hopefully the stretch is over and so i may bend those down i'm gonna go look and see what it looks like in the back but otherwise we're in the middle of week three of flower uh and that's about it we're going to um continue to watch these buds get larger so that's it for this time and we'll see in a bit gopro stop recording gopro stop recording go pro stop recording", "5uGdeqCkLO0": "hi let's talk about the gorilla glue number four strain gorilla glue number four was developed by GG strains by mixing three potent parent strains its a mix between Kem sister chocolate diesel and Sauer job at a ratio of 50% indica and 50% sativa it's known for being the winner of multiple awards like cannabis cups and High Times Awards and it's touted as a strain that every veteran must try it contains a THC level of 25 to 30 percent gorilla glue number 4 will make you feel relaxed happy and euphoric some possible negative effects include dry mouth some eye dryness and a small probability of paranoia it's often used to treat stress depression and pain it provides a hazy cerebral high that lasts multiple hours it'll thrive on a sunny and warm climate and it's got a high resistance to diseases it's indoor yields can be up to 18 ounces per square meter with an average flowering time of 8 to 9 weeks its outdoor yield can be up to 21 ounces per plant and it's available for harvest in mid-october this is an easy strain to grow to learn more about gorilla glue number four and other strains go ahead and visit our website today", "4d8eJCBbLCo": "greetings fellow humans suburban herb here and welcome back we're looking at our two gorilla glue clones it's been about a week i think since the last video so we're back for an update uh they've grown quite a bit seems to me they're about this tall around the last video so they've almost doubled in size now there's not a lot for me to do all i've done since the video is basically just watered them fed them i should say so they are getting nutrients and so i think i fed them twice and different than last time as i fed them i watered the entire uh pot so it's been a couple days since then and you can see they're still a little wet it'll be another day or so so taking a little longer in between feedings maybe three days possibly four but um we're going to look at the plants a little closely there's some interesting things going on but i'll just tell you what i changed here i did put the humidifier in um so we're sitting at 60. uh it's only i think our outdoor humidity is about 40 around now we're under so which is perfect for the girls over here who are in their final stages of flowering i believe well what do we have yeah it's almost 50 today but normally it's around 40. so pretty good i i don't feel i have to do anything with the humidity in this tent and i'm about to give them their first dose of ph water as the flush has begun so another week 10 days probably for these girls we'll see but back to these two so i am gonna clip away some of this stuff but we got some interesting things here to look at now i don't know what's going on and i'm wondering if maybe one of you do if you can see this what's going on here with all the new growth all the tops on both plants they're coming out sort of whack one side is coming out wacky and twisted which is interesting and it's on both plants you see how it gets folded over and it's everywhere here and beyond that you can see that some of these these growth the second growth they only have three leaves so i got some pretty good mutants going here uh hopefully they're gonna be okay honestly i have no real idea they look reasonably healthy again we still got some three leafers here so here's where i top them you can see it was staggered but so and i did the same thing here both topped so i don't exactly know what to do about this it's seemingly genetic not caused by nutrients they're not genetic but whatever i've done in the cloning process i've somehow cloned weird little uh three three fingered um leaves and as i said you may remember i was telling you how thin the leaves were and that's kind of it's still true these newest ones are slightly thicker so i don't know what's gonna happen but we're gonna keep on going for now so you can see how tall they are um that's a bit worrisome they grew like four inches or whatever this week five inches i had been giving them lots of room with the light so i was actually giving them 36 inches um which is plenty room because i actually want them to be tall to some degree because my ideas whether it's going to work or not i have no idea is actually to grow them tall as there are only two plants i want these branches to be tall so i can lay them down and get to these corners a bit so i want these guys to be able to spread out i want to be able to scrog this out is the idea it this may not work at all judging from these plants i'm guessing this is not the perfect scrog type strain now these are clearly they were grown slightly odd way too tall obviously and like not ideal but i i don't think this strain it's not a big yielder and what i'm seeing here are really small-ish but rock-hard tight nubs um now so that i'm just not exactly sure how that's going to translate in what i want to do here is just basically take these two plants and try to fill this a bit try to get a canopy going now it may work but the the idea is it so the reason i would grow them a little taller than than ideal is i want to be able to lay down these arms and in each of these spots here where i would have had to clip these off i want these to be laid out so we're we're getting we're making that our canopy that's all going to be our top so the idea is grow them tall so you can lay them down and create more space because i have two plants so you know the idea would be that this guy eventually is reaching here i don't know if that's possible at all but that's what i'm going to try i totally got distracted but i was mentioning the lights they they grow to the lights of course so i had them about 36 inches but since last video i also propped this up and put this little drain to waste idea in here if you've seen my videos you've seen it before i used it in the 6x4 for a couple grows pretty simple anything just to catch catch a drain into one spot it's good for checking your runoff i really like it i like cocoa i like this setup so instead of lowering the lights i actually brought the plants up a little bit now we're sitting at they're probably i dare say they're a little close because it looks like they're at about well maybe 20 inches or maybe maybe a little more but i think i would want at least 24 so i might put them up but at this point i think i'm just going to clear off a little bit of this before i blather on too much longer and we'll just have to see what works out here like clearly there's they've got some funky issues um so i'm going to clear out just some of this obviously this stuff down here is going nowhere just the smallest little stuff down here see ya pull that little mess down there that one little guy yeah and then over here it's an odd spot but i think we're gonna get rid of these little guys okay um it's i don't think it's too tragic to leave too many leaves like i kind of feel like that guy should go he's almost my only real leaf with five fingers uh but same with this guy and it seems like he should go why don't i just do it he seems like he should go maybe he should go and i'm gonna put these guys in that category those two big dudes and that guy okay that's it so now it's wait and see i think i'll get through that guy too which means i should probably get rid of that okay that's now hopefully these girls straighten themselves out um it's pretty odd i hope you can oh you're capturing that you can see what i'm talking about the way they're folded over and again it's on both plants which is oddly interesting and uh so yeah the only thing else is like i said i gotta try to create canopy out of this now the weirdness aside what i would hope to be able to do is get these branches these lower guys i don't know i don't know how it's gonna work out but the idea is i want to get these guys up and make our canopy here so we do want to we are going to be trying to keep these two down so i don't know you can probably train those by hand do that every day and just let these girls catch up if we can same thing and if we need to we'll start doing some kind of training but we're going to try to take advantage of each one of these these nodes on these branches but again we we need to get like a a foot of length here or 18 inches so we can reach the other part of the tent so we've done that clipping they're all watered up they got their weirdness going on hopefully that works itself out or if somebody has some kind of idea if it is something related to nutrition or whatnot or i've just ma done some serious weird cloning stuff here's where they're at and now we're sitting at uh 20 inches maybe i'll just leave it there and see if they do fine see or maybe a little bit higher but i don't want them to stretch too too much right now i'd really like them to figure themselves out here those look like they he's only got three we'll see we'll see so that's that these girls are about to start their flush oh one more thing um in case uh if any of you have left comments i like to look at them all i read them and i replied to all of them that seem to want to reply and i found a bunch in a like a spam folder or something and they weren't really spam someone had added links or replied with like a spam link to real

closer to the hash plant but still different Thompson or chopped colas right here and then just bring them into the dryer and when I have about five of them work around the plant and so future WaMu 10 if you're wondering why this plant is so short it's because I messed up with the neem oil in veg took a while for me to find out that this plant didn't like it every time I would spray that leaves would turn kind of like kind of like right now a little like they would fade and twist I know they just the way that bizarre flip there I'm just flushing it so I guess that's just what they do to get flushed but anyways I lost veg time and that's basically why they're so small this one I mean that's basically why these plants is so short I like the other plants which don't even fazed by the name spring not even at night even at night it didn't help low doses everything just those shots distinct smell smells really cushy it's a little peppery hard to describe but it smells like kind of like

review the best strains around the first review of 2019 we ended off last year really strong but today we have a sativa dominant hybrid good ol gorilla glue so right off the bat gorilla glue is kind of that light green almost grayish tone to it looks really nice there's some orange hairs in there and flavor-wise it's very interesting because you do get that piney note you definitely get that piney note but then at the end it gives you kind of like a sour like cheese almost so a really good balance of flavors there excellent points bet now this train is actually derived from three other strains and those are known as chem sister sour dub in chocolate diesel and all three of these are known to have very strong flavor profiles which give gorilla glue number four its signature taste and effects it does have very nice relaxation effects in medicinally if you nee have any troubles with stress management or depression management this is gonna be a good strain for you to start with yeah and this we'd normally piny piny strains I noticed that they are you know we use them in bowls a lot so this one we put right in the bowl and you know you could taste that kind of concentrated flavor we would also recommend bongs - this is a great weed to pack I would say it's pretty good to roll but we we decided to pack this kind of bud I need to go to you Dave the first score of the year we have a very nice strain here Gorilla Glue what's the Bama rating on that and any final thoughts so gorilla glue number for the flower this is the first time I've actually gotten to smoke the flower for gorilla glue so it this was a good experience and there was a lot of hype in my mind and I have to say it did fulfill all the all the hype that I had been told previously the flavor was spot it does have that gas enos that earthiness that pinus to it and this is the parent strain to a lot of my other favorite hybrids so I really I was really happy to get to smoke this one the first score for 2019 gorilla glue number four is going to be understandably so a 4.5 out of 5 so we ended last year strong and we're going to start this year strong with a nice high score but who knows we've got what's gonna happen next time yeah so very nice 4.5 a very good score well there you go guys if you see gorilla glue definitely the Bammer seal of approval guys thank you very much for watching and for everything weed and weed related keep it here on bamboo TV [Music]", "JSbEZKUsbXs": "[Music] hey folks the turbine rainbow yet now their medical marijuana grow up today we're looking at a brand new strain I'm growing growing this for the first time it's called gorilla blue number four and here she has got two plants to look at we have one right here and one right here and the group of blue number four is up hold and high bred this looks like a very worthy girl as per usual I grew this thing in the 77 litre garbage containers you can see we took some off the bottom here cleaned it up till it branches off then dit down we're in week seven right now so we just started leach it's starting to have a little bit of a color change taking some of the leaf out so that the light can penetrate this girl has won some awards she's won first place at the High Times Cannabis Cup in Michigan also won first place in Los Angeles and in Jamaica the High Times world cannabis cup this looks good unbelievable strain the growth like there's a lot of chunks there's golf balls everywhere you're not getting any really huge chunks but there's just lots of them like look at this one here this thing that thing's gonna heal we just finished that we're moving a lot of leaps in the lake from penetrate and then she's one frosty girl and it's got a powerful narcotic odor to it you know what we got to do now we gotta get that camera close in so you folks at home can see how frosty these girls are so keep watching [Music] [Music] [Applause] this girl lelu looks like a mighty fine plan I can't

"SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "1KmmattNZxg": "greetings fellow humans suburban herb here and welcome back it is the fifth episode i believe of this seed to harvest series or more aptly called clone to harvest i just had to check it's been four weeks about since i transplanted and here they are if you've seen it before you know we're having some funky top issues new growth it was all twisted and funky and it continues to be so uh i i looked at the lights to give them a bit of relief and see if we could uh uh rectify this issue with uh nutrients perhaps uh calmag or um we also flushed them and just made sure that we didn't have any ph problems and it doesn't really seem to have changed anything i don't know exactly how clear you can see on the gopro but every new growth kind of has this little twist to it so that's what we're dealing with and i don't know maybe it can still be resolved i don't exactly know any ideas are welcome i'll try we'll see but i mean the plants still growing everything else is reasonably healthy and the the growth do eventually open up into kind of a more normal looking thing but clearly there's an issue of some sort but uh i think we're gonna soldier on and see what we can do with these because we started so for better or worse this is what i chose to do a live series on so here we are now today it's been like nine days since the last one all i've been doing is feeding them keeping an eye on them a little bit of training only like as i said i was just doing it by hand just keeping these two main shoots just giving them a little uh training by hand but now that a lot of the bottom growth has caught up ish which was kind of my intention what i believe i'm gonna do is uh i'm gonna hang that scrog net from these uh ratchet hangers and we're gonna lower down and just bring everything down to the same kind of level and we'll just flatten it out the other thing that i thought i might do today actually was to top these again so clearly they were topped here and here we are like three or four nodes later which is normally when you might want to consider talking again if you're going to but i'm not sure it's necessary like for one i just came here earlier to take a peek and see justice before i did this video just to see what i would be clipping and honestly it's really not all that clear what and how i would clip to top these frankly like when i look at these it's not all that clear but as i was looking at them earlier i'm wondering if i need to top at all because see what's going on here it's almost like they're self topping in a way like they're they're pulling out all these different new growth from where that top was so from where i topped it on this stem we've got one two three four like five new growth so for now um i don't think i'm going to do anything with regard to topping partly because i wouldn't know what to do with that but also um like it's it's almost like they're self-tapping in a way right seemingly that said uh so what we are gonna do i said i was gonna put the scrog on and uh but i won't make you sit through that i imagine that might be slightly tedious but once i get it on i'll do a little clip and i'll bring you back to take a look the other thing i would do is um we're getting to a point where i would clear out a little bit of what we might not need in here there's a little bit of leaves that are slightly damaged and so that being the case looking a little soggy i'm just going to get rid of a little this like these big guys here i think i'm going to have them that was interesting just the way that clipped seems weird these whole plants they're just odd but we're going to keep going so i kind of want to get rid of these older bigger ones down below from what i understand they're less efficient and if they're mostly hidden then uh they're not they're not uh what are they not doing somebody help me out they're not converting much light like they're not doing much work if there's no light getting through them so from what i understand if light is passing through one leaf like 15 of the light light passes through the one leaf so very little like a small percentage is getting through and if it's not really a new refresher leaf then it's it's less efficient so how much work is it actually doing please don't necessarily look super healthy okay they're all mutants i'm just gonna get rid of a little bit of the understuff now this guy here is never gonna make it up top so i will have to do something about that but i don't think i'll do it right now oh but i'm just gonna get rid of these under guys but that's guys should go oh there's gonna be a reason not to clip it right now not really let me take him off this guy's got an equivalent over there he's a little closer to making it this guy is just not gonna make it i don't think yeah he's got more of a chance i don't like that guy there either okay and that i think i'm gonna remove and he should probably go too i don't know is that ridiculous like okay i'm gonna leave him because i'm undecided i really don't like those little three-fingered leaves okay so a little bit of that i'm going to do more after i get the scrog on and see how it goes what i was going to do is i i fed them yesterday it's probably a little more runoff than i need maybe not yeah that's probably more like 25 so 500. i'm feeding them [Music] what i feed them 750 i believe is what i aim for figure out exactly what i gave them so around there so ph is good they were sorry the ppm at 510 would imply the plants ate some and the rest came through a ph on these i'm feeding at 6.1 and now it's sitting at 6.6 what does that tell me not a time frankly because i've got sort of mixed impressions on what how people interpret runoff i heard that um it's not necessarily all that accurate and you can't really use it to say like i can't look at that and say oh the ph of my medium is too high i gotta do something about it and which may be the case but i've also heard people seemingly indicate that it's it's not that accurate that you can use it in that type of measurement so i'm not really sure i have to get more information on it but i still check it just out of curiosity i certainly i i have acted on the fact when my ppms were high so that's um like that's pretty standard indicator that you know you've got a lot of build up in your in your root system so that's a good indicator the ph i haven't quite figured out yet um if i would need to adjust it if or if i could adjust it based on what i'm seeing in my runoff so what was that 6.5 or something presumably um yeah my nutrients recommend 6.1 for the veg period or veg for their veg news so uh would i consider um doing like a uh a feeding with a ph of say five seven near the near the lower limit to try to bring down the the total ph in the medium or does it not really that matter or does it not really matter that much all right i will clear off more of these i feel a little guilty sometimes clipping leaves i gotta control myself at times so that's basically it i will uh for this i will add the clip as i said i'm gonna fill the scrog nut down here and basically just to train these for me just to sort of keep everybody at the same level i'm not gonna be uh worrying about uh you know putting through things through it's a little earlier than i would normally scrog but i'm trying to accomplish something a little different here grow them tall like i said let's see if i can get these out to the corners of the tent uh if i can fill as much of this tent with these two in their five gallon pots so that's about it for these next step i don't know i'll i'll still be looking at whether i should be topping them but i'll have to consider whether it's necessary and with that we'll take a look at these girls for a moment the real glue's number four i believe we are on the eve of harvest look i'm about to do what's become a tradition and that is sort of just a walk through of the whole grow just a live update i did it for my first grow a year ago as my first video so i will continue to do it and they look beautiful i have to say beautiful colors nice hard nugs and i was just checking the trichomes i've seen a nice amount of amber or you know a small amount because i was a teenager we were all cloudy all week but we're just seeing some amber so it's looking good this okay i'll save this for next video so that's it episode five clone to harvest see you next time gopro stop recording there it is with the hanging scrog um in case anyone's interested i have a video on how to make scrogs like this standing and hanging i'll put a card up there because now i know how to so all i'm doing this is basically for training it's not exactly so much you know as traditional scrog but i just want to train these in them seems like the easiest way so uh you know this is just spreading things around otherwise that's it for now see you next time go pro stop recording gopro stop recording", "PfEhbiE9DUw": "[Music] what's happening guys welcome to another strain abuse Saturday for the CCC 4:20 and my name is Nick so today we're gonna be looking at a really interesting cultivar of cannabis coming out of California that I'm really excited to be smoking on so this is the gorilla cookies it's a cross of gorilla glue and Platinum Girl Scout cookies and this stuff I gotta say is awesome that the smell is crazy just off the bat it just has this huge huge strong doughy cookie overtone I mean if you smells a really good batch of cookies it has that strong dullness that few lead oh that totally just hit your nose but it's in the background more on this stuff but you get hit by a strong lemon earthiness that really hits the nose at first with that cookie dough enos in the background really an interesting strain that you can tell you can really smell both the parents in the strain so I guess I should explain the genetics this cultivar is a cross of Girl Scout coupon Girl Scout cookies specifically which is a strain that you guys all know and love it's a strain that's really popular here in California blowing up all over the west coast and guerrilla glue number four this is a new relatively newer strain bred by Josey Wales and it is an awesome cultivar I gotta say guerrilla blue is definitely in the top list of my favorite strains it also has been you know huge popularity here in the West Coast and all over the US actually it's just a fantastic winter strain I've had some batches of Gorilla Glue that really surprised me on the potency and the flavor of the strain and it really has this strong lemony earthy easily chocolaty funk that is really unique to the to the cultivar and when you put those two cultivars together you get the the cookies so you're really putting to powerhouse trains together to produce this cultivar on this stuff it really shows it's awesome so I'm going to pack a bowl here of the gorilla cookies let's get another sample to smell oh my god I'm breaking it open guys it's strong on that cookie fuel really really strong on the cookies don't get me wrong but really glue also is fueling when you broke it up it does have that diesel in there that gives it that fuel eNOS but the cookies I mean if you smoke cookies and you've broken it down it just got this crazy loud fuel that predominates over a lot of strains and when you break this stuff open it just smells signature to cookies there definitely is an earthy lemon eNOS in the background there though I'm almost a menace as well but it really has that doughy doughy cook eNOS let's take a rip here of the gorilla cookies I'm gonna be using a torch and a wand right now because I'm out of beeline I prefer beeline but a torsional wand is really great flavor produces great flavor as well it really comes down to personal preference on what you like but let's take a rip guys cheers guys [Music] [Applause] [Music] Wow that tastes amazing holy [ __ ] Wow I've been smoking on the stream for a little while guys and that really it just has an excellent flavor especially out of you know a nice clean piece and a glass one oh my gosh the flavor is incredible totally heavy on that cookie dough you smoke cookies you know it just really has a strong strong Dobby flavor fuel ido really like cookie dough and this stuff totally has that it definitely has some of that gorilla glue earthiness though in the background I gotta say that lemony earthiness is there but this cannabis is just amazing looking I gotta say I mean the trichome coverage the nug structure the trim job everything is done really well the you guys can see that looks a lot of the Nuggets are pretty dominant on the cookie side really has a lot of that blue purple cookie coloration throughout definitely cooking nook structures they're thick you know chunky dense nugs but you can see the gorilla glue in there as well a lot of the nugs are actually lighter green and they have sort of that gorilla glue caleb's structure that you that is typical gorilla glue and I'd say the pistol coloration is definitely with the gorilla glue if that if that dark brown orange gorilla glue pistol that you you definitely associate with that strain but this the looks are incredible I mean I'd say it's a pretty even 50-50 split between the looks it definitely actually leans a little more to the cookie side but the gorilla glue is totally present and the looks as well I think when you put really glue and cookies together which are two strains that produce a ton of resin the offspring is just going to be incredibly business and this stuff is not to mention it's also very dense and sticky and gooey and when you broke break it open it is just really really fresh and dense as well let's take another rib here guys and assess the flavor and the hi cheers guys I would hit me hard guys in the head totally just set me back there and that flavor oh my gosh this stuff tastes incredible I'm not kidding this stuff was grown really well and it was flushed really well burned some nice white ashes that's a no it's flushed well and cured and dried well and the flavor totally comes through really strong it has that earthiness of the grill igloo one when I sum up really blue I think of an earthy skunky diesel II sort of flavor chocolatey almost that is that is definitely present in the flavor it sort of hits you you get hit initially by the strong cookie dough enos that coats your palate but at right after you get this nice earthy lemon in unis that just sort of sits on your tongue and you really can taste both parents there but I would have to say the taste is dominated by the cookies but I don't problem with that you guys can see I'm a fan of Girl Scout cookies it's one of my favorite strains and so I'm really enjoying the flavor so let's crack one more rib here so we can feel the full effects of this cultivar and I gotta say guerrilla blue I've smoked many batches of Gorilla Glue and some have just surprised me on how strong they are how tasty they are I mean really blue is just an incredible strain and platinum cookies is probably my fugue I saw probably in my older video that I love platinum cookies it's just an incredible strain as well so the parents on the screen were just it was a no-brainer it was set for greatness and you can see in the offspring that it really comes through [Applause] [Music] [Music] know every time you rip that canvas take a hit off a nice bong like that the flavor you just can't deny it Wow super super nice it's Titan the lungs definitely gets choked up um you could tell it's of high potency stuff and just off those rips guys oh I'm [ __ ] high I mean I'm not even kidding this stuff is is I was surprised on how strong it is is really up there with some of the strongest cannabis I've smoked it just hits you so hard it really is a strong indicator hybrid he hits you really hard to get your eyes red it gets you sort of disoriented gets your body relaxed totally you can feel it warm fuzzy feeling flowing throughout your body and after a while gets you pretty sleepy guys I mean this stuff is some stony stony couch lock indica cannabis but it's very enjoyable as well it's very pain relieving very sort of relaxing calming and we'll get you sort of lost in the days in your own thoughts totally totally stoned but I hope you guys like this video I am totally medicated now definitely loving this gorilla cookies I hope you liked it too it's an incredible cultivar and it's really an incredible props of some premiere cannabis genetics coming from California but I'm gonna take one will rip you guys get nice and baked but I hope you liked this video if you did please give it a thumbs up please leave any comments or questions in the comments section and I'll be back for some more strain of each Saturday's so

want to do a nighttime video of these ladies and get an idea how they're looking under a whiter light as you can tell they're pretty frosty the yields not gonna quite be there like it should have been but uh you see these buds are just they're falling down you know with any this is 600 watt grow and I had some issues they got cold you can see I have was rust I was running an ozonator in my garage it's something you're not supposed to do if you got a grill going apparently I learned that the hard way and it got cold for a couple couple weeks there for for a while other than that I'm probably gonna cut down this next weekend this coming weekend I'm gonna be going out of town so I need to get these ladies down before I head on out not too shabby not too shabby I mean they're super frosty this train always comes out really frosty it's just not as healthy as I as I hope the note structure is that's pretty good but it could be better I've grown this strain a lot better before and in soil so I have a pretty good idea how she does Leigha not too bad not too bad at all I'm excited a lot of this is gonna be made into two dabs some wax yeah we'll just be cutting down I'll do another video with some close-ups of when we're harvesting and whatnot other than that yeah this is a Dean of the road for these ladies you know we'll go ahead and fire it up again just hear it another week or two I'll have clones ready get them started actually today or tomorrow and try again probably run a different strain this gorilla I've run it twice in hydro well I've seen my buddy run it once in his setup and my at once in mine and it does this every time it gets just ridiculously tall real hard to manage you know it seems to be a lot more rewarding in soil or if you've got the height you know that's all we're both restricted on height so that's you know it's maybe an unfair an unfair judgment on the on the strain so just just not working out in this little small tent of mine so I'm gonna probably run like a bait dream or a critical Jack haven't quite decided yet but definitely gonna try something different from the glue well you know we'll see how yields out and everything might be worth trying again who knows but until then we will see you guys in a couple days I guess over the harvest video so yeah peace out", "RhRRP0rAd78": "what up youtube smokeup420 back again here man

high peace", "7HHTQQQZk70": "yo what's up man another review i got the um live resin another live resin pod from stizzy as you can see gorilla glue number four i've been looking at forward to actually trying this just because i i'm a big fan of the strain gorilla glue and yep still brand new i already verified it even though i got this at the stizzy store themselves over here in uh san francisco i'm located in oakland but i travel to san francisco to grab it let me show you guys our box as you see live resin half gram gorilla glue number four verified 73 thc which not bad for a live resin you know they can go anywhere from 60 to 80 so let's go ahead and try this you guys are gonna see it before me oh actually i've seen it right here on my camera too okay so right off the bat i don't like this uh don't like the bubble that i have and i don't like what is this you guys see that little small piece sticking out from my pod over here staring at me people walking by that was weird i just bit off this little tiny rubber piece yeah you can see it right there i don't know what that was never had that before in my pod but i don't like this little bubble right here i'll be honest one thing i don't like that bubble all right this is my mimosa pretty much done i haven't smoked today so it's going to be the first smoke of the day so i can be able to review and see how potent and good this batch of live resin it really is stizzy all right let's see first let me try to take a dry puff let me see what any prominent flavors however they say it it smells chocolaty like i literally get a ton of chocolate it smells chocolatey and i smell a little diesel yo i taste a little chocolatey that's that's such a trip like it's very it's extremely faint but it's faint enough to pick it up without being overpowering all right let's see first of the day oh wow you know these half grams here instantly it's instantly just right on my all in my head already wow wow this is this is this is really good product i'm stoked wow it completely just like already you can already like instantly that's just crazy i can feel the hybrid it's a lot more intense and it's a lot more intense behind the eyes than the sativa was which is kind of mind-blowing now that i think about it because the sativa was heavy in the eyes this one's a lot it's a lot more heavier in the eyes and i feel it in my legs a little bit because i got them i'm i got them moving like crazy like any time i feel a good high a good body high my legs i always have them going like that that's how i can tell but man this shit's good i i'm i'm digging this product a lot like this gorilla glue number four honestly tastes better than what i thought it was going to taste like i've seen like two or three reviews on this before i did one myself and everyone was saying that it tasted like old wax and it didn't taste good and the high barred was barely there man my tolerance is extremely high yesterday i ate 100 milligrams of camino gummies didn't feel a thing that's how my tolerances were 100 milligram edibles are hitting misses for me sometimes i don't feel things sometimes i'm buzzed but this has me high like i can feel it it's an enjoyable high like i'm satisfied i don't need to take another i don't need to take another hit like i'm satisfied and it's a half gram so i definitely want to save this oil as much as i can but the high feels amazing i would uh from a one or five i would probably give it a i'd give it a good three this is a three a four a three is satisfied so i'm satisfied a four is lit like you're you know you're lit and then a five is almost too much like you know it's like you're a vegetable pretty much like you know like a couch lock type of high like edible what have you but yeah man this uh it tastes chocolatey it's it's not it doesn't really taste earthy or piney it has that gorilla glue tones to it exactly exactly what the flower gorilla glue tastes like this is what it tastes like except very faintly you taste the live resin for sure and the high is just man i can't get over the high the high is amazing like it feels really good so this gorilla glue number four i would recommend you guys to go pick it up look at this dork oil i mean that's how it's supposed to be trying to put it in the light it's supposed to look that dark but i like it i like it a lot all right next one up ice cream cake let's see what y'all got what you got on that what do you guys think uh that one's gonna taste like do you think it's gonna taste anything like ice cream i've never had ice cream cake nor the flower so i'm kind of excited for that one as well but so far this gorilla glue is nice like the high is really good i want to take another one so i'm going to that tastes great wow that tastes really good like i love how it leaves uh your palate like feeling like you just took a dab like i literally finally have this pen on me and it was like wasn't in sight and someone came in my car and be able to smell this and be like wow this smells like you just dabbed up in here it smells really good too i love it thing about these for anyone that's uh i gotta say this for anyone that's uh trying to hide smoking like from your parents or whatever or from family i wouldn't recommend these live resins just because you can't really hit these in your room and just be nonchalant and chill like as if nothing's going on because the second someone walks in your room if you take right after you take a hit if someone walks in right after you're definitely gonna smell this it smells like straight weed like which i love and but for those that might have a problem with that uh you gotta you gotta put that into consideration before you can just hit this around your house willy-nilly you know even though there's people at home you like you could do with uh you could do that with almost any other cart just because the fruity tones to it with will hide the marijuana smell or sometimes it won't even smell like wheat it'll just smell like some [ __ ] fruit punch or some [ __ ] you know so that's something to uh definitely keep in mind live resin live resin car carts or pods tend to smell like weed when you blow the smoke out so something you got to look out for for anyone that's uh you know smoking and you know around people that they don't want them to know that they're smoking or whatever but i highly recommend this man stizzy there was a point where stizzy was boofed i didn't mess with stizzy they didn't get me high it was they were whack they were whack but now i can officially say for their live resin pods that they get me high man they get me satisfied too like they don't give me two going like i'm not like over here like stuck or whatever i'm still functional as you know as you can tell i'm still communicating and no there's not a problem there's no problem it's just that the half grams go kind of quick i can i can pretty much already imagine just because like look at that man it's already a bubble in there so you can see that right there so it's gonna go by quick probably like two or three days i'm gonna try to make it last longer but yeah so you guys uh are you guys uh like to um see man this high is amazing [ __ ] i just i just want to focus on i want to end the video and just focus on it hey but you guys have a great day leave a like comment subscribe uh recommend me anything you'd like to see me try out in terms of cartridges anything that's available in my area i would definitely try out um i still got the the west coast cure next and i still got uh another stizzy live resin ice cream cake pod next and yeah uh comment below if you'd like me to talk anything you know talk about talk anything more about this if you want me to drop any facts about stizzy any background information on them how they how they distill their how they make their live res like just anything that you guys would want to know ask ask questions below i you know gladly answer them to the best of my knowledge i won't if i don't know something i won't say i won't tell you if that makes sense if i don't know the answer to something i'm not going to tell you what i'll tell i have no problem explaining giving my opinion and telling you what i think is the answer but i'm not going to tell you something that i'm not going to tell you something when i don't know if the answer i'm telling you is 100 and i'm not going to tell you like as if it's true you get what i'm saying a lot of these people on here when they're talking they'll they're just talking and they're rambling and when they're talking they're speaking as if what they're saying is facts and a lot of them fail to fact-check themselves like if i ever say something that's not true i'm definitely going to be like that might then uh correct me if i'm wrong i'm gonna say something like that or i'm gonna be like you know this may not be true so don't take my word for it you know this you just got to be careful with your words you know you don't want to mislead people but yeah see look this guy this thing got me around me so you guys have a great day uh happy monday this is when i'm uploading this and yeah you guys uh enjoy yourselves man be safe out there peace", "opWnYnr5kDk": "hey YouTube welcome back to the darken plantar growing amazing

hundred parts a day starting snowball out and hopefully we'll get a well this will be a nice little harvest for you guys to see so grow glue number four day 16 all right everybody yourself good night take it easy peace", "Wbp1eUiV1qY": "[Music] hi what's going on folks welcome to the show so today our topic of discussion is gorilla glue gelato from the harvest company harvest of Maryland and they harvest some pretty good stuff if my humble opinion before we get into that I wanted to make a quick statement about my hats so at some point in time one of my viewers have asked me where would I go about acquiring a hat of such fine quality these are actually like Halloween skull hats and I got this from Spencer's and chromium all several years ago now I'm not entirely sure if Spencer still has them or what the deal with Spencer's is I don't really shop there it's not really my own I don't go to malls let's be honest so that being stated that did go to the whole today on my way through Columbia for wherever I was going and the thing that I actually came up with was another hat this is more for my own political statements if I have to give on so I like what I see here this works for me it does have a little bit of bubble but I'll tell ya if I have to tell it how it is this will give me the the increased word of mouth yeah so anyways yeah I picked this up this was like 16 bucks it works really well and like I say check it out we're not here to review hats we're here to review weed so gorilla glue gelato horace company the THC rating as it would already been in the title is 27.5% so it's not bad and according to the readout it was a [ __ ] okay so according to the readout now the gorilla glue crossed with gelato is an amazing hybrid to bring is calming and euphoric relaxation to the mind and body believes you functional and alert for social activities gorilla glue gelato is known to treat depression insomnia and muscle or joint pain and anybody that smoked a few joints to the head knows a thing or two about joint pain hell yeah so let's get into this um as a generalization first crack of the top okay this is a very earth easy grassy kinda if you imagine our skunky funk with the grass essence behind it it is really good imagine like a field of grass that was made out of little skunks and then it just came by a Buddha fresh field of skunk grass this is like right up that alley and like I say for the percentage it's really not that bad all things considered oh yeah so let's get into this for today's device I'm going to be using a little Chilam and I got a hose and I attach one to the other if you don't want a tutorial on this we'll do that but this is really good for sneaking a smoke no matter what the circumstances because if you've got a little hose like this it's I'm gonna hell half the time I don't even know I'm smoking true story bloggers huh [Music] you know that's just really good smoke it's earthy overall it really tastes better than it smells which is hard because it's a stinky smell all things considered though I am rather impressed um yeah the reason for using this device for reference of reason the overseers that control this platform don't want to be in violation of any terms of services I'm here just to provide educational products or educational information about products that I purchased for medical use 100% it's 100% medical yeah it's 100% medical and I should put my damn political hat on for that yes so ever the other thing is they text to chat or speech to text so like if you say anything that's out of line that it's all already read through computer so like they can auto do a lot of stuff so anyways yeah like I say I just try to avoid certain things no hard feelings yeah but my own folks if I had to give this overall it's got the taste it's a really good taste this gorilla glue gelato is skunking it has the THC appeal overall if I had to give it a number I would give it closer to 1/8 I mean Christ wise like I say I got this for a price that you all may not be able to find it for now so much respect on the price but um yeah hates about where I'm gonna leave it I'm happy with the mate yeah other than that I think that's about it folks so hope whatever it is you all are doing or whatever you get into today tomorrow or any time in the future I hope you all do it well and do it yeah with good intent so high fives digital peace out enjoy [Music]", "7IMoEkD9-gw": "I've got one of the most well known strains to smoke on today I'm sure some of you all heard of it I'm reviewing gorilla glue number four coming up [Music] hi I'm strange and this is strands of the bay if you're new here I review strands around the Bay Area I also have a second channel where I pretty much do everything else

guys very much and back to the gorilla glue so a girl of glue number four actually changed its name recently to Gigi for due to copyright and the name of the actual gorilla glue company and this trend is actually a hybrid and it does give you guys a heavy-handed euphoric and relaxed sort of a mindset so keep that in mind this is more towards the indica side as opposed to wards there's a deeper side this is one of those strains that are gonna leave you glued to the couch so keep that in mind when you do try this out and it's three parent strains our cam sister star would dub and shop clip bezel this strain has received first place in the michigan and los angeles 2014 Cannabis Cup as well as first place in the jamaican world club world cup and like I said in the beginning of this video this is one of the most well known strains all over the world I'm sure you guys haven't tried it you probably heard of it and yeah we're gonna try it out a bit so some of the effects you could be feeling on this particular strain are to be relaxed happy euphoric uplifted and hungry some of the medicinal uses are for stress for depression for pain insomnia and lack of appetite some negative effects from the strains are you're gonna have dry mouth dry eyes anxiousness paranoia and a bit of dizziness so make sure not to smoke too much so you don't get any of those bad effects and the flavors that you can expect to be tasting on the strain are to be earthy pungent and piney alright real quick guys before we grind it up if you're wondering where I got this strain I actually got it at Secret Circle so go ahead and check that out if you are ever in the Fremont City / Union sorry if you are ever in the Fremont slash Union City area holy [ __ ] Wow okay so right off the bat this thing is very cushy varied easily very gassy which is my favorite type of aroma that comes from the bud I do like fruity and sweet smelling bud but the gassy OG type diesel e stuff is always my favorite and this has it to a [ __ ] tea this thing is incredibly strong kind of slaps you in the face a little bit but this is wow this might even smell better than the sunset sherbert to be honest but that's just my opinion I love Khurshid easily gassy OG smells and it's right here this is a smell 10 out of 10 straight off the bat you know amazing amazing alright it's about that time if you guys have anything to smoke on I suggest you pull it out now whether it be a bomb pipe blunt joint whatever you got so we can hit this together so I'm gonna just pack this up real quick and let's do it [Music] they want to put too much in there but yeah that's a decent amount and all right so you guys should already have yours out if not too late let's hit this choose y'all alright guys we're just gonna start that timer right now alright guys so right off the bat as you saw I was able to take that whole hit and one want it so pretty smooth via taste the the taste to be honest is not as strong as the smell so the OG flavor not super in your face but it is a little sweet there's a bit of pine and a little bit of lemon in there as well but the gas eNOS is not as strong as it smells still pretty good but I can never have enough so you know that's just my small little complaint there other than that tastes probably 8 out of 10 not bad pretty good so it's about a minute in so far and the effects don't hit you right away it's kind of like in calming sort of effect you know it doesn't hit you right away but it does set itself kind of slowly I can feel it and as you guys can see it's kind of getting harder for me to talk but yeah this is a slow creeper not really one that hits you right away so keep that in mind of it as well all right guys it's about a minute 45 in and the effects again I'd like I said it's slowly coming upon me and something that I do notice is that my stress levels and just the way I feel in general right now is completely relaxed I'm not really thinking about too much I am yeah I'm just chilling right now pretty much stress-free so if you guys are stressed out this is a strain for you kind of calms you down so effects are still kind of setting in so I'm gonna give it a few more minutes and we'll check in in a bit all right guys it's about three minutes and 10 seconds in right now and yeah effects are still kind of slowly setting in the stress levels are still extremely low I'm very very relaxed right now feel no pain although I don't really feel pain in general but my body just feels really really really good very euphoric stress-free not really thinking about too much this is something I probably do in the safety of your home if you're out and about and you need to converse with people and be at the tip top of your game this is not the one for you mainly I'd use this to relax to de-stress and to unwind so maybe perfect for after work something like that that's what I'd use this for but yeah shoutouts to Secret Circle and Freddie thank guys is another string that I didn't have to pay for so last check in I guess so five minutes and 50 seconds great strain overall for the strength and the effect that probably give it a 9 out of 10 very relaxing but not overpowering if you do too much though definitely it's gonna mess you up but right now it's a perfect amount I really like it so 9 out of 10 there's a great strain thank you again Freddie shoutouts as you get circle don't forget kids don't do drugs so give them all to me [Music] no food up in my system when you blew up in the hood it's kind of hard to be uplifting no water from the faucets in the bathroom or the kitchen so we couldn't take no showers and we couldn't watch no dishes almost funny in the class you didn't know my teacher nerves by me [ __ ] with no

not sure if they're still releasing it but they did last year in the year before and she won a festival in 2015 I believe or 2014 in San Francisco and here she is I mean she was just gorgeous a treat to grow very very easy I reacted very well to nutrients I used heavy 16 and this round about the last four weeks I went very heavy on the teeth to try to see if that would bring out some good flavor and good aromas and what I got was just a very super earthy very sour fruit and a bit of coffee just a gorgeous gorgeous smell anytime you get close to her look at those buds just giant giant buds very happy with her um I talked her about eight times and like I said it took her sixty-three days the last 14 days or so about 13 days I started the flush I wanted to make sure I got all the sugars and carbs out of the leaves to make sure that when I did begin the drying process I would get the cleanest and smoothest smoke and it worked out perfect I got a nice ripening on the branches you see the yellowing throughout the whole canopy I think that if I run her again I'm going to maybe start the flush about a day or two before to see if I can get more of that yellowing throughout but all in all I'm very happy with her and I should have a smoke report once all the flowers are dried here in the next I'd say four weeks or five weeks so stay tuned but I just wanted to come with you and show you this if you are really a fan like me you're excited so like I said stay tuned here for the next three or four weeks and I'll have that smoke report on the grill igloo stay high and happy growing

week one here as you can see they have stretched a bunch they've really filled out this scrog nice you got real nice coverage there they're super happy I got the lights pretty close there's they're slammed on these guys they're 1012 inches away they're loving it though I have a feeling my bulbs are getting a little tired most likely so we'll change those up our next grow see how see what the yield is like in this one I know you can see they're starting to do something throw some but throw some hairs down on this one you get starters down here you can see all that they'll start packing on here in the next week or two once they stop this stretch still gonna waste still go quite a bit of room when we step back here so we can get a full view that's a seven-foot tent that's for plants hydro to 600 watts and as you can see I've got about a foot maybe a foot and a half before the top that I can I'm gonna be able to I'll be able to manage this grill no problem as long as they don't get too crazy on me they shouldn't but yeah everything's going good so far so good not a whole lot of new this week will probably throw up a sprog maybe maybe next week or the week after let's do stop stretching other than that and then these ladies are doing good I love this gorilla glue I'm excited for it oh hold on one say I got a bud of this my buddy girl let's see littered with trikes so this is kind of what we're looking forward to is not the biggest but I could find but get you an idea of the resin production that these babies put off it's freakin insane come on lights mess I want the

the end of week a and we're just gonna try and step into the grow tent now as you can see guys this is what it's all about coalesce and draw what all that branch is literally falling all over the place with the way to the board's right that's sake true okay day 56 I think the first one we're gonna have ready for harvest is our plant in the middle it's very hard to separate which from which but I'll do my best right some of the unusual techniques of you know using wooden branch the bangalter private plug branches in has been working pretty damn well so that one there is a gorilla glue all right that was out of the light and that's [ __ ] up wonderfully by being propped up against my Matero blue and I gotta reset that like so bingo there we go I'm gonna try to fill that one that now black to the plant in the middle right so we're bending out these branches of matar\u00f3 blue oak oh and open up these inner bits and we've got some nice colors that are somebody's big boards even lower down the plant as a result itself she sticked oh pretty well big long rolling hose benefited from the lollipop culinarian Go Go is the way those work you want the trouble feet all of us that's how you do it dee-licious they can't really see the colors the hair is too well the car longer that's powerful every day well the resin combs are pretty good you can see it's frosty as hell the hairs are mixture of orange and red all its had pretty much in the hunty % oh my god she's frosted [Music] can't wait to smoke that so our baits just waiting for her to die out when fortune them now for the whole week about ten days in fact four yeah boom here and then yeah I think it's gonna be good yield so we've got like bunch of these really lovely colors got one two three it's not on that's actually on a different but yeah there we go four and five you know alright okay move it along now the back saying not-so-great matar\u00f3 blue sorry will now the patients with this looks frost you know not the most productive just and slow or an indica plant I'm now at a time reading I don't need another week or so so reduce we try to get that down but altogether more frosty affair look at this the Gorilla Glue hahahaha yes colas everywhere now this came in fantastic really really impressed with this sososo frost so stink looked reminds me of like a really really pungent kam dog so our own gorgeous and it's frost and we're really really well alright so this one has you know again sort of branches and colas flopping everywhere its way down all right so that's what I want to see so got on me another week or so we're gonna continue flushing her maybe 60 days 63 days something like that give it the nine weeks get all the flavor out likewise this one again very Gore production no you speak Chong keyboards very very fast and consistent that last one it's a bit of a different phenotype as you can see going on close there these boards are all kind of foxtail right and it's again it seems a little bit slower than the other two so I'm gonna have to probably give that one the full nine weeks as well but yeah it's pretty good producer and it's way down there they're all flopping everywhere so I'd advise you early training and prune and probably ask rock as a matter of fact to be the best way it's do these strains with the exception of the two boom in the middle like don't get me wrong your greatness grubs well it's more low-maintenance any kind of just be alright like what I'm doing will from that out had a few and maybe mean against women everyday boudin yeah there we go guys it's the end of week eight so that's your last look at the kaboom next time you see this", "Ei42DIdMnWI": "[Music] what's up everybody let the check out the flower room yeah we gotta get a better system for or I gotta hook this up to help get the humidity out of here but this is it 70-something this is it's 55 what's just cool as you guys can see I got the HP s light going we were in flower started her Monday so hopefully this turns out amazing hopefully some good girl just watered her today ooh this is the gorilla glue number for some problem try to stretch this out down here more this one too that's what I probably should do hmm there goes my baby I had her on 50% for the the ballast which turn it up to 75% and then I'm gonna wait probably 2 weeks to turn it up to a hundred percent which we will put it at 600 watts so that's the plan this gave her some water some light light newts because first time ever doing Coco Loco yeah say right there got my dehumidifier so this uh that's it for the flower room you guys want to check out the girls in the bedroom and we're back cyclic that was these are my girls some of them looked a little funky and I really liking that so much it looks like this one's flowering like some pre flower on there to me [Music] so yeah I'm have to keep my eyes on this one even or strain that is blueberry number two this one is and it looks like it has looks like it's pre flower to me which I hope not that's gonna piss me off because that's opposed to if that's a pre flower runner that means it's it turned out to be an auto and it's supposed to be you know a photo period so oh you guys remember the two taproot seat ahead it's right here [Music] kind of cool you know she's pushing out pretty good this is actually an auto so I'm gonna I'm gonna top this right here tap this one let these grow out a little bit get more of a yield on them oh yeah that's uh this one's too close to the fan actually I just got the SK in here so [Music] wonder if I should put the 602 up there yeah we got to come in here and top some plants top the couple of them some of them look fun look at this sir this is the Afghan Kush it looks funky as hell maybe it's a needy plant possible I'm just sitting there looking at that [Music] the supposed to be a stem have turned out to be a leaf [Music] see that [Music] it's crazy but this is the update for

two plants I mean these things come he got him straight from clones as well I mean he put these things down I believe July 1st July 1st I believe he said he put these things down and this gorilla glue is just quite the strand I mean my goodness look at look at this thing I mean he's definitely making me want to grow outdoors next year I hate I gotta wait a whole nother year but just check these things out talk about my gosh look at this this is amazing he didn't do nothing neither I mean he just put him in the ground and ordered him this is quite a job I mean these things were only in the ground from July first till now and he definitely picked a good Sun spot cuz my goodness these things are huge all righty just a quick video I wanted to show you guys is to guerrilla gloves all right

looks like so she is looking pretty done [Music] like I said I really wished that I would have done a little bit on this plant but that's okay such as life we learned next one should be better so we're gonna start chopping her emptied out the that's got no water in and it's been flushing for over two weeks we're gonna start chopping it and hanging up to dry [Music] [Music] Hey [Music] i won [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you were sipping on the Tuesday with [Music] [Music] I know you're here with somebody [Music] [Music] let's go - I guess she's me without a hat

it's already been a couple hours since I chopped everything here I have taken break but I haven't looked at the roots yet so we're gonna look at it together here so I'm gonna just pull this out here oh please [Music] my roots there [Music] okay so this may look weird here but I figured I don't have enough drying room this can stay in there keep drying so I just used its own stumps essentially as drying for the access that I couldn't fit up on my dryer so I don't know we'll see if it works anyway I want to keep it in here because this is where the filtration is gonna be for the smell and everything like that so I wanted to keep it in this tent for right now I mean for now this is gonna work so there's the look after harvest got a bunch of but out of that not sure the weight not they're really gonna know the weight on this one sorry everybody you know medicine was more important than final weight so I'm gonna work on the next one a lot harder to try to see if I can get a better final wait for everybody to know what's actually how much is actually pulling out of the system like this so I'll give a rough idea once all this is dry but there'll be some final video or whatever catch up but not official numbers of what this tent could pull not yet anyway not this cycle so that's about it that's gonna get closed up and just keep drying for a while and until it's all ready to be taken down and we're gonna switch this room around so that about wraps it up for this one we're gonna have a lot coming up here we got tents moving into this room the whole thing's moving around a lot of changes coming up so watch for that video that one's gonna be a lot of work in that video of how to make this small space work with so much going on in it so like subscribe everybody

water right here is root X iron I'm going to use that because when I take some of the cuttings off I'm going to try to turn some of them into Cologne and yet I still not rip it to Nellore Fino and this one's a bit early there's some signs but I don't want to mistake it before you guys can take a quick look at the plant a little bit better so I'm gonna go from you can see where you I started having leaves so it's one two and three you think it go but I'm gonna go four and five and that's where I'm gonna cut it on supplies I'm gonna write about up here I'm gonna throw it in the water real quick but at the same time if you want to look I'm gonna try to do it a few different ones out of it so we'll cut it right up here as well and then on this one I'm gonna cut up here cuz the middle is down here I'm actually gonna use that producing hourlies so to bring you back to the gorilla for right now here now when we stopped it and some of the things I'm going to do to it is that I'm going to go grab my wires real quick can you stay right here I'm sorry for leaving you guys so this is the wire I was talking about this train wire for plants because I don't want to train it too too hard right now just on it I'm gonna use the Sammy fright under it you don't want to to to tell you because you do want them to be able to read I got some little pieces here that I'm gonna use instead of taking new pieces every time and the reason why I want to do this is because I want the plans to go to be trained a little bit and as level as possible later on them will try to can maybe make it a little tighter here you can without breaking anything there we go one of the things I am going to do with this is a front to keep it as level as possible it is another experiment again see how well it works for me this one short enough that I'm not gonna have to and that's where we're going to leave it maybe a little bit at the bottom I'm now going to use now I'm going to down one death every knock using this one here we're not gonna use that one either line it as much as possible I will leave this one actually now we'll take it off so I'm just gonna leave one two and then I'll do it again I

that that's good six inches all over the place just buds everywhere so it's looking pretty good so this is our feeding schedule for week three here - b-52 just personal choices I don't run b-52 until week four I just push it back a week that's just my own opinion so I'm not gonna bore you with pouring all of these again but there you go there's what we put in our lovely hydroponic system for this

is coming out this afternoon and i'm going to take you through possibly the most famous strain on the planet the most potent strain on the planet gg4 gorilla glue number four original glue whatever you want to call it uh thc levels can be anywhere from 18 to 32 percent uh this patch is very potent grown very well it is probably closer to the 32 percent what it should look like gg4 should have rounded nugs like this as you can see rounded nugs a forest green color the midi maybe should be a little darker than this uh this if you look at the hairs on them they should have oops that they should have amber hairs the trichomes this should be sweet sticky resin with the trichomes they should be white with a little bit of an amber tint to them the smell of gg4 is the same as the taste uh it's comes from a line of chem uh i think kem's sister is one of the parent plants of it and it has a very sour oh a little chocolatey earthy inhale uh has a very decently gassy exhale but all in all it's very pleasant a little sweet uh you definitely get a lot of sourness it'll make you pucker on your first try uh if it's really good stuff anyway uh so yeah that's the taste and aroma and how it should look the feel the feel of when you smoke gt4 right away you should get an uplifting sensation in your mind it'll hit you right in the face in the head first you'll feel absolutely no worries

best medical strain in the world and i love it i've been smoking it for a long time for my chronic pain and depression uh it's a wonderful strain uh i grew it this year this isn't my batch but i did

and I'm Caitlin and this is I dig it boy oh boy so today we got a blood review for you guys some client overview just a single strain but a super hyped up string because this is go really blue number or if you're also a Californian or just up in the the weed news you would know that gorilla glue number four won first place at the Cannabis Cup so we're really excited to get a hold of this hello yeah so uh you want to showcase it yeah yeah I'll be smoking it out of the diamond glass daily driver here which we got from lemaistre smoke shop and the bud courtesy of House of candidates no within 24 hours all right let's get this phone set up and let's get this bud on the [ __ ] camera god damn dude just that the trichomes alone are absolutely ridiculous Wow holy [ __ ] you see the structure of this sticking together all as one body fuse a bud with dark orange hairs look like they're coming out from the stem - it's got a real like potent piney smell to it - try the trichomes are like I I'm honestly I'm honestly having a hard time believing how visible the trichomes are they look like hair is coming off of the bud on every piece of the wood really really no and they're so yellow because they're so and caked in there with it with THC won't take the focus alright check this out oh boy cut it comes apart like it's a play-doh or like it's like malleable oh man I think they're gonna want you're gonna want to know how this smokes okay let's show well so yeah at the house of cannabis they have a happy hour special we're from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. and also 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. you get $8 top shelf grams $12 Private Reserve grams and I would pay $12 for $12 for this gram of it any day this this stuff is super caked gnarly yellow trichomes on his super filled with THC I'm honestly gonna I'm kind of worried that this is a too sticky to say you know those buds you get that are little too sticky to smoke like they won't burn oh well like wet dry house yeah yeah they're not they're not quite cured this is some fresh bud for sure always picking up fresh bud from house the cannabis but we will see Cheers oh geez chest is still not doing too well but Wow oh my god it tastes very particular like you I would know what strain it was before I got told cut you okay let's say I like that it was a little wet not not uh not a hard time smoking though how do you like that yeah not harsh at all super easy to take super super easy like I mmm I want to want to finish that ball off that's that's good but for sure I'm super stoked oh oh yeah I got more at that man yeah so we have a package coming from Americana refinery which is our San Diego refinery that makes the wax that we love the chief on so uh we went into the house cannabis today to see if our package was there it's not there yet so but what they did have new Private Reserve strains so I had to get one yeah picked up some of this gorilla glue number four but hoping to get that package today don't know

some just some drove that's that's not it's a hard task to accomplish it's it's got its own taste it's gnarly that that Gorilla Glue is that's this amazing that at a high that the high is very good the the THC and those try comes is so so caked in there that it's yellow the trichomes are filled completely laude and the the taste of it is in this to indistinguishable from and it's it's it's it's getting me higher as we're sitting yeah it's very good I'm obviously I haven't stuck on this Gorilla Glue nut before I'm um overall I'd give it a nine and a half I know I know why they get that this one cannabis coat look time at a time look is ten out of ten absolutely varies there is nothing wrong with the way that bud look the way it broke it up was awesome yeah the only thing was that it was almost too fresh yeah it was too sticky like I predicted but you know it's all good this will this will be super any one bud and probably like a week or two you want this yeah there's still definitely some some hints in there this but is extremely extremely good I would recommend it for anybody that's that smokes any sort of Bud it's pretty bad the Empire a trip to clear this bowl and call it an

tonight taking a look at the move gg4 flower this of course is the gorilla glued number for this one this 8 here in particular is coming in at 858 milligrams of THC 0.0 milligrams of CBD this is a hybrid option or option from them my take on it whenever I give it a try it's got some sedating properties to it so I would personally how it affects me it affects me more of a indica leaning hybrid it's definitely one that I would use later in the evening maybe around 8 o'clock 9 o'clock or so before I really go to my real strong indicas for sleep overall it's a really good string no uh really good effects really good taste smell visuals it's all around it's a really good strain good package buds usually look pretty good this is one of their tier 1 offerings here if you let you see that there so we'll get in here see what see what it looks like [Music] [Applause] you okay we got a some decent little buds here I mean there's there's a few little popcorn nugs here and there but that's going to be expected with eight typically overall not bad trim on it looks good get some good crystals some good trichomes on it there smells a little bit of citrus just have a little bit of a citrusy smell to it let's see what kind of weight we have here 3.5 so weights right on where it should be [Music] overall I mean it's a it's a good strain I've seen it in both tier 1 and tier 2 tier 2 typically being your smaller nugs I've actually had the tier 1 and tier 2 both of them work well if you're a hybrid person here you are really good notorious strain not too many of the usual smokers

chopping block we got delta farms gorilla glue delta eight thc cartridges let's talk about it people's and gorilla glue is my favorite strain but this unfortunately does not it's not identical to it man let's just get straight to the point um i was hoping they could replicate it which they kind of did replicate it but it's not it's just not the same genetics the same makeup and of course most important is the delta non-thc content but hey it is what it is it gets you off the ground and i do recommend this [ __ ] because it it does what you know i mean what you expected to do it's just not it's not that real real um what i did though i got the cbd gorilla glue they have that too dr gonzo got that [ __ ] the link is in the description by the way a and when i mixed the two cbd gorilla glue and this delta eight thc gorilla glue that [ __ ] was the truth that [ __ ] was official i must say but the other cartridge is more the cbd is more expensive than this that [ __ ] is crazy you would think that chc would be more money but it's not and it is what it is i don't know how they make their prices up yo it gets you stuck man i must say it it is what it is it could be better but at the same time also it could be worse you know what are you going to do should people go highlight dr gunza get you get you some gorilla glue you won't regret it people be easy be safe peace",

my warmup bong hit on katana which I freshly cleaned and then I'll tell you what the hell this show is about all right but as you can see from the title it is gorilla blue number four on the show today now the whole concept will Leafly versus the trap is imma keep that thing all the way a hundred which show like a lot of people on here have access to a lot of different things like you can go to you know 17 collective to get whatever you need to do like you want to review a specific training you can go to this you know you have fifty different collectors you can go to not everybody instead lucky so I'm gonna start a new series in which I compare you know the information on weekly which if you don't know is an app you know marijuana athlete basically tells you all information need to know about any stranger you're nothing compared to what's actually out here on these streets and to see if we really got the Pekka so with that being said like I said already cooking it let's go ahead and see what Beasley has to say but first I thought it's breaking me down in my dream I had already smoked like the majority of what I picked up last night because it was that good but the smell first of all it's very very pronounced at for example it's not like overpowering like to where it's too much but it's there immediately like it's not you don't have to look for you know like somebody you gotta really get your nose up there it's not like unpleasant smell smells really good the smell is really good and Leafly described as a pungent I didn't want to use that word to make it seem like I'm just kind of going along with the flow but it is actually a very pronounced smell obviously well I'm like I say obviously but like actual smells that you've got for me with very earthy I love earthy smells and buzz you know a lot of cushion have you know that real herbal Cushing like just earthy smell you know it wouldn't know you know what I'm talking about but anyway I love that smell and it's not like super strong in that because it's like pine saw like tiny look like the classic pine scent is is pretty strong pretty prevalent in the gorilla gluten before or you know the cut we had in front of us today so what that makes it I'm gonna go ahead and take another hit cuz this is that delicious right so we were worried so let's go ahead and jump onto the leave the app and see exactly what they have to say all right so the rule is Lu number four the potent hybrid strain that won first place in the 2014 Los Angeles cannabis code this chunky conic crystal-covered strange tongue twister flowers at 56 to 60 days and is said to come from Kim sisters sour tub and chocolate season so those are the three strains cross or supposedly cross to make this in by the way just a side note weakly hasn't been like off on some of their crosses like where's that put a Girl Scout cookies one of the most popular ones they actually have you know cherry pie and well let's not get into that right now let's not bring that into this right now but they did have some genetics on from the original and I mean you know how could you be sure you can't be mad enough for that but anyway let's look at that face it's say the fixer relaxed happy euphoric uplifted and creative now like I said I smoke a lot of this last night and really I came up with a lot of different ideas for different videos that I want to do in the future or you know even this concept leafy versus the trash was made through smoking just a really good like initially I was just gonna do this you know and the strain of you okay it's located how does it say side of this no but you know kind of everybody does did we get okay so here are the flavors so it says earthy pungent and pine like I said and that's that's actually that part is extremely active that photos some of the photos are showing like a lot of one else they have a lot of orange chairs you know some lawn chairs or perfection Yemen I'll up the pictures that I took as well in comparison to the leasing tickets like you can be the tentative thing but overall the comparison guys whether this was the routine number for it not on that I absolutely look at the next thing to be free spot on to what we had to say about it in the pictures not too far either so if you smoke your Laguna before let me know what you think about it yes we'll see you next time on leaking personal travel this time I think the traveler ha welcome Eagles up day and I say it's okay don't know which one I agree with fell from Volusia", "zzHh8QuQc24": "all right welcome back my

transplant I just transplanted them into the flowering tent so I did the super cropping yesterday look at all the blue gelato filled out and that one a little bit of yellowing going on inside here might because of the flowering I know it's because of the nutrients pellet didn't pump my my reservoirs like levels weren't high we'll see what happened in its transitioning right now I've seen this before I have a nutrient that I give it if it starts turning yellow because of a deficiency if it's turning yellow because I fried the plant basically like that your thought as I'm talking video in flies moths I've come up later I let it out of the tent but anyway there's all the sites coming up look at that here illegally just filling out that trellis net the blue gelato filling out the tradition tell us net these were the two other smaller ones this one was all right that one was the smallest one it's in a different pot I got these ones in air pots that ones in the fabric pot all the other three are in air pots and mind you they get the nutrients for the roots from advance new trance right now on this line but yeah I think I got the cheat the water a little the reservoir a little hot so what I did is I cut the reservoir down from what it was what I was working I'm not gonna just blot out the numbers because it like I said it wasn't really high but I mean other people don't run their reservoirs this high this early in transition anyway I did get it over let's say over a thousand it was over a thousand but I don't know what exactly it was I didn't think it was high [Music] then again maybe it's the lighting because I haven't gotten all led in a long time it's now summertime so I don't use my fluorescence highlights or the high pressure high pressure sodium or my ceramic metal highlight or whatever the nicknames are for I used those only in the winter time yeah guys this is a day after the people years in project putting them in a trellis net putting in their

the gorillas blue and blue mist blue gelato 41 clones so I grow them in hydroponic deep water culture on my first run and then those so good with that small buds and a gorilla glue [ __ ] up the root system very airy buds but that could have been not from the hydroponic system that was just this plant loves to eat loves to be water I mean it just every day I could put a gallon in there and every

your life as if you get on like me and let's get it so today we have some gorilla glue from the honey badger you already know what's up shout out to generation green once again hooking it up got two grams for 60 check it out it's not a terrible consistency but I gotta say each pack was a little different you know some of them some of it was a little more grainy than others the texture is fairly dark you know or the color on it's a little dark but um it's cool it's not bothering me not one bit you smell on it's not very loud I'm not really getting oh gee from it it's kind of got a funk smell to it not a bad funky smell to it but it's like kind of like kind of like a dark chocolate smell you know like the cocoa I don't know we will go ahead and take a nice fat dab of this we don't see what's up so you get your little piece together your dad what your boy one time see what's up so let's get into this go ahead and do little to have a Chino couple whatever turn these torches lit these nails hot let's get it you already know dad doesn't matter what time it is doesn't matter what time it is dad dad ready to give right like oh you already look hot I'm told y'all this is hot I woke up like this on some Beyonce [ __ ] you know I always always that way it's never a big deal when I am a you know it's never a big deal I don't really do the rising thing unless it's you know calling for so yeah I rock it out I love being half what about y'all you like davon is it for medical purposes we all have our issues so I'm sure we all deserve a medical card yeah cheers y'all Gorilla Glue the fumble didn't hurt the hit I tell you that much so the really glue trying to taste it while I'm coughing cuz all I'm just getting is just the hit which is nice it's very heavy Gorilla Glue okay the flavor is there you know I've tasted a few you know variations of the gorilla glue number four as far as flour goes so as far as the taste I'm well aware it's supposed to give you somewhat of an effect of like you know this is what I hear and so you know based on that that's what I always look for but it's like I like a elemers glue type of taste if it was really really really fire it make your teeth feel like you know like you couldn't not not that you couldn't separate them but like as if you put a bunch of glue in your mouth and it was all over your teeth you know like a like you'd have that layer of you know all of you know you know I'm saying like for those that would you know when you were kids that you know yeah you know what I'm talking about I don't suggest to me y'all go out and try to compare the two like smoke a little gorilla glue and eat a little Elmer's glue and try to compare that I don't suggest but yeah if that's what if that's what we're going by it has the flavor none of which you experience on the exhale most on the back end like during the car for as you know like right now like the aftertaste as far as the high goes it's settled in on my eyes nice and hot it's very heavy on my eyes as far as a star count on this thing I'm not trying to be biased but you know I've tasted a lot better gorilla glue and so you know I'm gonna go ahead and give it three and a half stars you know not that it's bad or anything just because I feel like you have to set a president you have to set a standard and I mean the color honor is not that great it looks like if I had another microscope it probably has a little contaminant maybe maybe not it just you know just doesn't look that appealing the smells not really even there as far as you know popping it open you know try to rub it do something trying to you know scratch-and-sniff activate or something no smells not it's not loud enough you know so something has to dump down right so yeah you're gonna go ahead and give it a three and a half stars but I wouldn't I wouldn't use that as any reason to not pick it up you know three and a half stars is perfectly fine in my book when you consider its two for sixty so it's a quantity over quality type of thing you know so yeah three and a half stars is legit so a little bit of that guerilla glue from generation green just know you don't get right you don't get right but it's just a few things that you know might not you know be as appealing to you as you know maybe you know you would like so you know I'll pick some of that up you know anyways this has been dabbling with Cali man peace", "bGJgeSYkAdA": "hey guys it's Alex you're watching elevate presents today we're doing a strain review of gorilla glue number 4 OG ra\u00fal rosin brought to you by altitude organic medicine gorilla glue number 4 OG is two types of live plant material made into bubble hash and then pressed together to create raw rosin it is 70 percent THC 0.2 percent CBD and 17 percent Terps so I'm super excited to see how it tastes and smells let's go ahead and take a peek see what it looks like man this looks like peanut butter I love rosin because depending on what type of plan it is it can always have a different consistency this looks phenomenal it looks like peanut butter almost like a butter that you would see when it's consistently getting whipped after it's been blasted in pho lucky for me that this is solvent list so this is gonna taste freakin amazing let's go ahead and move along to the aroma and see what it smells like wow man that Gorilla Glue is standing out quite well and it has an amazing terpene profile and I can definitely tell there's a little bit of cookies mixed in there because hi love cookies definitely Gorilla Glue number four and dosi dough's are some of my favorite strains so I knew that this turf profile is gonna be amazing and it is so I'm super excited to see how it tastes let's go ahead and move along to the taste test just want to give a big shout out to elevate glass gallery calm for always hooking us up for some sick pieces to demonstrate with check out elevate premiere for all their artists and glass also Cheers that tastes exactly like gorilla glue number four holy it has this super pungent gassy taste that comes with that phenotype of number four that is exactly what I expected what I want out of my gorilla glue number four crossbreed plus this raw rosin really has an extreme amount of turf game since it's made with live bubble hash super excited for dab number two because I want to see this cookie strains stand out [Music] whoo that is delicious god I can already feel the onset of the effects happening as we speak the taste is phenomenal I highly recommend you ever have a chance to check out the rosin we're any type of gorilla glue strain the flavor hardly ever changes don't forget in between each one of your dabs whether you're using a banger or an email but you always want to clean the apparatus that you're using having a nice clean environment always ensured that you have the best flavor I'm gonna go ahead and sit on this for 10 minutes and then I'll come back with my review now for the final review of gorilla glue number 4 og by altitude organic medicine man Matt rah-rahs and rocked me for the visual aesthetics I gave it a 7.5 it was beautiful nice little peanut butter consistency had this nice Sheen it was super glossy which I knew means has a lot of terms for the aroma I give a 7 point to it had this nice gassy gorilla glue it was beautiful and tasted just the same way as smell and that's how I expected it to taste from that gorilla glue number four and those dosey doe strains for taste ago 27.7 it had that super gassy pungent piney taste it was delicious I mean every moment of it was beautiful they just dab it out a little bit boy it was amazing for the user experience I give it a 7 point 8 I mean it was super easy to load it didn't sizzle had no residue left over after I vaporized it it was beautiful and he tasted just like I wanted it to every time that I took it down now I'm super baked which gets me to the effects Wow seven point seven I mean I am rocked the effects really helped with my lower back to kind of give it that numbing sensation and took my pain away for the final score of Gigi number four og gear to 7.7 it was a super delicious I really really had this pungent flavor to it it looked like peanut butter and it was super easy to look it was beautiful I would recommend if you get the opportunity to take advantage of it because that is some super turkey stuff if you want to see a strain reviewed again let us know if you have anything that you've never heard of before do you want to see that also I'll always find it and I'll hunt it down and I'll review it that wraps up another straining review I'm Alex and you're watching the elevat-- presents I'll see you next time [Music] [Music]", "SM0hWc-1Iro": "what up YouTube so I finally found the culprit is to how my three girls and these are three true girls got pollinated and it was this male gorilla group right here now I got this seed online and this is telling me to never purchase Eve's online again so the seeds that I got right now my rock wheat into the wheels fall off and this is how I could tell gorilla glue is a male because this might look like one nut like just a fat nut but it's really not a nerd it's just a cluster of seeds there's just a big fat cluster see that cluster as gets it as cluster there's just a whole bunch of cluster of seeds that make it look like a nugget is really not there's a whole bunch of seeds but I'm glad that Gorilla Glue was a male because who like I say who wouldn't want a gorilla glue male to pollinate anything like man that's a blessing right there so we got blueberry OG pollinated crossed with Gorilla Glue Auto and let's get in there real quick now you can tell this is a female because look these are straight colors right here yeah they have they have a few seed in them here in area like there's one right there but those seeds are gonna be sorry about that yeah a funky trippin but that right there is a true female seed because a male pollinated this good healthy female and this is a straight color is not like gorilla glue like this is a color a full color with one seed in it compared to gorilla glue where it's just clusters and clusters the seeds I'm saying just clusters the seeds everywhere all right let me get a little bit more nut shot on the very a little bit more seeds in that color and I'm going to show you all the seeds I collected so far from blueberry and from these other three girls right here because these are the three main ones that that's smokeable right now is white widow number one Girl Scout cookie and blueberry Gorilla Glue I don't know I might use this for edible [ __ ] all right so blueberry let's get to Girl Scout cookie the Girl Scout cookie got that frost and she only gave me a few seeds but every seed that Girl Scout gave me I took because like I say who wouldn't want a Girl Scout cookie Auto cross with the gorilla glue ATO that's just a perfect cross right there an immediate that that top Girl Scout cookie nut we were looking at and flower that's her right there just frost action and finally white widow number one white widow number one oh man I love this plant bro I love this plant across the Gorilla Glue I just love white little structure these are gonna be my two favorite sees to have is the white widow across the way Gorilla Glue and the Girl Scout cookie cross the guerrilla group if I do any trades or anything I can't trade these I'll trade some blueberry OG crossed with Gorilla Glue but these these two plants were just too frosty is to myself oh man so there we have it shot Las Vegas nights harvest I come back a child with a what a way in update I don't want to cheat like some people on YouTube where they be weighing up nugs that's not cured yet I still got water waiting oh yeah these are the seeds right here so first we got a white widow crossed with Gorilla Glue 911 just when I got him a female and I wrote a little note on each one so I know like months down the line is she female pollinated by male female white widow pollinated by male gorilla glue automail next we got blueberry OG cross with Gorilla Glue auto again female pollinated by Gorilla Glue automail 911 next we got the Girl Scout cookie cross the gorilla glue female again pollinated by male gorilla glue 911 and these are the gorilla glue Auto male plant seeds I don't know what I'm gonna do it yet well I'm gonna keep them but I don't trust a male seed because the male see it could be a male so I might use these for a future future crossing so let's get into the see-through quit white widow number one see they're looking nice and dark and healthy can't wait to get to those and thanks we got blueberry LG cross with gorilla glue nice nice I think because the blueberry gave me the most seeds I think this is well over a hundred seeds it might not look like you but when you count seeds they had a real quick next Girl Scout cookie makes a gorilla glue Auto female pollinated by male gorilla glue nine eleven now my Girl Scout cookie didn't give me that many seeds so like I say the seeds that she did give me I'm gonna cherish those these few seeds I might even do one bro lineup just full of Girl Scout cookie make sweet gorilla groups just a whole a whole season of those and finally gorilla glue male plant seeds I mean they look good but I don't trust them and they look different you could tell these are males cuz they got like one stripe on each one and they just built weird compared to these these have a whole bunch of stripes now Girl Scout cookie is just a different type of plant I don't I've seen fire plant seeds before that don't have tiger stripes especially feminized seeds feminized seeds look like these seeds all right here they don't most feminized seeds don't really have tiger stripes they're just plain seeds like this that was Emma night so I was doing my trimming and boy look at these scissors bull he says has got so much good resin I don't from the scrape off [Music] we is cute", "Ykd6K25WWv0": "alright youtubers fellow growers let you look at this gorilla glue I got going here we're just start in week

she's filled out at three by three Trey I have underneath there get you a good Ariel see I still got my SK 600 on a mover see no other way just get a lot of you know really good coverage having it move side to side and you know kind of mimicking maybe you know clouds in the skies the sun's up there worthwhile investment that's for sure get in on this one here is pretty nice-looking fan doesn't blow it out of focus here said I did come out here and I did some selective pollinating see I just have some of the branches marked with string and that would those are the branches that I pollinate and just build up a little bit of seed stock but I didn't want to you know pollinate the whole plant she'd be pretty cool collect some seeds off of this both of the fee knows that I bred the male was a beautiful male just grew really strong I mean obviously this female is just you know definitely worth breeding and keeping around so there you have it till next week guys take care", "3Rw9bEexFRU":

gorilla glue number 4 also known as GG number 4 because the lawyer said I couldn't say that gorilla glue strain phenotype number 4 is a cross between Kim's sister sour dub and chocolate diesel it's coming in right around a twenty two point nine percent THC and at 0.05 CBD I friggin love gorilla glue number four so super ecstatic let's go ahead and get into it and check out the visual aesthetics now that looks fuzzy it looks super furry there's a bunch of trichomes on there this has a very unique color green it's not too orange it's not too green it's just kind of minty let's go ahead and crush this up in the grinder and see what it smells like what we have 1/2 gram ground up let's go ahead and take a whiff and get those sweet ole factors working that's a super earthy pungent smell it's not too gassy but it's right on the limit of being a little loud on that diesel side it smells amazing though the bud is so sticky that it kind of stuck together inside the grinder and I can't shake it up man that smells amazing let's go ahead and get it in the vaporizer and also put it through the burn test we've got that sticky icky icky loaded up in the vapor let's go ahead and fire down [Music] it tastes super pungent and super earthy it was phenomenal I mean it lingers on your tongue almost like like a Chardonnay wood it kind of kind of coats your whole mouth I want to see how this roasts up and let's go ahead and put it through a couple more on vapes [Music] wow it's roasting quite nicely it still has that pungent flavor this sits on my tongue even though it does have that nutty coffee roasted flavor without combusted and I'll make sure you're always stirring your bowls and you're paying attention the hotspots when using the vaporize [Music] now for the final review of gorilla glue number four brought to you by be chronic boutiques her visual aesthetics we gave me seven it looked super frosty he was so squishy it's so sticky vibrant orange hairs crawling all over it it looked amazing for aroma we gave a six point eight it smelled like some super gassy some super sour earthy piney pungent super loud cannabis for taste we gave a six point eight you could definitely taste all those sour notes throughout the first four or five vape its it roasted super nice at the very end also I was thoroughly impressed we user experience I gave a six point nine it performed really well on the burn test it just didn't have as many vape its as other strains for effects I am fainted so it gets a solid seven point one I am feeling like I don't want to do anything I literally wrote down that I'm just blasted they've got extreme cottonmouth and I see why they call gorilla glue you're stuck right to the couch for the overall final score of Gorilla Glue fino number four or aka Gigi number four it gets a solid six point nine it was super tasty super piney it had some super pungent tones to it didn't have as many baby it's as I was liked but it sure got me rocked I am super scaring my friends and that is why I got a solid six point nine well I'm Alex with elevate presents thank you for stopping in again I appreciate all your kindness and your support if you don't

here we got the official results for the dry weights so we got the glue here and it's just SuperDuper sticky super frosty this is all trimmed up this has been tared and these bags are 15 grams each I'm going to drop this in so 268 - you're 15 or actually these are 16 so - 52 and I had to split the glue into two separate bags because there was so much it was just too much for this little scale to take at one time should we tear that out okay 2:54 so 239 so the glues through some basic math real quick guys 491 grams total on the glue nut dad set the user side then we got the BT y ou G super frosty as well zero it out here so 406 basically double-check that earth there we go 4:13 so pretty much 398 now that's just a large nug the what I did like I told you guys I was going to do is I actually harvested and separated the the large snugs now this is not like shake or even trimmed these are actual nugs but these are just going to be for squishing rosin so these actually I would count towards the weight as well and then where's my other bag boom this is the OG and these are straight LARP nugs as well a little bit of sugar trim that I left on them not much so we're going to go ahead and weigh these up too and add these to the total okay 96 resting on anything zeroed so 80 grams so do was a okay and then for the gorilla glue larf this little bag is seven grams I waited before this video I only bought two bags of or two packs of turkey bags which came with two each so I didn't have enough turkey bags go around but uh so 109 so this is 102 so go ahead and add all this up and then I'll go ahead and go through the comments see who the winner is and I'll be back all right the official dry weight is in and we're looking at 1070 grams total the split was four hundred and seventy eight grams for the vty and 593 grams for the gorilla glue so it's a little 1071 which gave me a gram per watt of 1.13 which is a little bit lower than I usually get but it's because the experiment that I did with this grow I didn't trim the bottom nugs up as much because I wanted to see how the sugar distribution in these plants was without being manipulated so now that I know I know that I definitely need to continue manipulating that sugar distribution trimming off a lot of the bottom large stuff because you know I had about 80 grams of lore for the BTY and 102 grams for the gorilla glue so about the 20% almost a little bit more almost 25% the yield was larf so about 20% so I definitely don't want that so next girl I'm going to pay that a little bit better but after going through the YouTube comments our winner is in j-josh 973 I believe so I'm gonna be hooking you up my dude got some Martian candy seeds here's that you can crack hopefully you get a female one got some stickers here some general hydroponics stuff yeah fun bunch of different stuff so look you up with all this and then I've got snoops newts rolling tray for you smooth smooth rock that [ __ ] last couple rows it's pretty awesome and then I also have couple rosin cartridges coming your way one of each strain just to show my appreciation so I'm getting ready to press out some rosin but before I do I want to believe you guys with little little grip of this here BTY oh gee it's pretty bomb my phone doesn't want to focus on it with this light right now but that's alright so Josh go ahead and drop me a comment below with your email address and I will reach out to you so I can get your mailing address so here's that cheers everybody let's see how long I stay on YouTube it's so smooth so clean fire so check this out some of the gorilla glue Keith that just came from the trim bin it's like a hundred and twenty micron I believe and I was really surprised to see that it came out almost full mil at 120 micron it's not something I'm used to with the gorilla glue so [Music] see that I'll get you a better close-up of that here momentarily go ahead and load up with a ball of this so this stuff is fire I'll attempt to get a melt shop for you guys on this stand up here man straight Keith its are always so fire all right so that's it that's the dry way reflecting back on this harvest like I said I would probably train the plants my normal way which is doing a lot more aggressive defoliation throughout their whole grow and making sure that I really get the plants to focus the sugar distribution on the colas that I want them to instead of all of those lower branches really just sapping the energy away so that probably veg a little bit longer and now that I'm doing soil and not hydro things are gonna have to be a lot different I'm not going to be able to do fully as aggressively because they won't recover as fast they won't grow as fast and also getting the watering time down it's gonna be a little bit of a challenge for me so we'll see how that goes but overall everything else look pretty good no major deficiencies or anything so I probably won't change anything as far as the nutrient feeding goes especially now with the soil like I said its water only I've got my recharge my mammoth key see I got this right here recharge and I think I gotta have a piece somewhere over here anyways if you guys don't know what mammoth pee is look it up it's awesome stuff so hopefully between those two I'll be able to help the soil grow yield better a lot of people ask me if I expect it to do better than the hydro I expect it to be better quality with a better terpene profile more full terpene profile but not more quantity I don't expect to yield more this is sub cool super soil recipe for 2017 and it specifically says this recipe is not meant for your high yield it's meant for high quality and now that I just grow for my own personal use and I'm not you know selling the dispensaries at the moment I don't really care about the quantity I just want the really good quality so that's what I'm focusing on right now and yeah that's it so if you guys have any questions comments anything dropping below stay tuned for the next giveaway where I'll be doing is probably a little bit more than this and the next run will have some organic 100% organic solvent list rosin cartridges so go back a couple videos if you want info on purchasing those I've still got quite a few available both strains BT y OG and the gorilla glue and I've decided that I will be doing half gram cartridges those and there'll be 45 shipped so anyways that's it catch you later", "_O9dP2cor1M": "banning then wrong smoking weed weed is from the herb God put this here for me and you take advantage man [Music] medical marijuana peppers is only a molasses Karl if you're not gotta go all right so it's medication time for Gregory it's hey there was uh distant that we got the gorilla glue from the black bottle boy see black shirt black bottle boys Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions down in Portland um they could got it out and crumble they do things to bring new things about cps one it's the gorilla glue it's a brand new streams at CPS and two they have a Thailand crumble they've never really had anything on crumble before um so this is awesome so that being said got my rib pit some [ __ ] confusion there so now all I know is this is the gorilla go I honestly don't know if there's a grill a good one two three four five seventeen 575,000 I have no clue but if it's the gorilla glue just like the regular gorilla glue the first one that means it's the chocolate diesel cause for the sour diesel chocolate diesel Costas our usual it was a gorilla glue number 4 which is the others cut at roville it seems to be floating around Connecticut it's the chocolate diesel cross with the sour dub across the counter sisters again chocolate easel cause the sourdough cross with the camera sister but if it's a new credit gorilla goonz flown on connecticut now thanks to CPS it's in the original one it's the chocolate diesel across the so diesel or if it's another kind of acrylic glue I don't know any was like it isn't I'm just straight line you but we'll see what it smells like stay from it okay so as far as the CD MMP name goes oh yeah it's from below my here the THC numbers I mean how the [ __ ] is the numbers in the TV this high if it's weed Michael you said that you got like 87 percent THC like what like is this it's crumbled Scott Street holy [ __ ] alright anyways there's plenty right all right back towards college thing it's called The Oval X see babe Oh bollocks yeah CTC numbers I was like what the [ __ ] it's a high kick but uh again it's a concentrate yeah it's good clock in a like eight it's got 63 percent THC a an eighteen point seven percent THC nine triangle one so sounds like CB some fire I've never had a crumble from CPS I have no idea what could be in this bottle it's gonna sort then really Center yeah it stinks like [ __ ] [ __ ] stinks I'd smell whatever it is my first opening bottle I kind of like hit me in the face alright so let's check this out together [Music] [Applause] yes or blacks Obelix Hey well I feel like there's a fire pit like the wicked surprise well but that jarrah this [ __ ] that's some [ __ ] those look

about this [Music] [Music] almost all this extra oil in here is HF oil so you have a little CBS [ __ ] so again in grillak little 1 2 or 3 or 17 I'm not sure which one from Connecticut pharmaceutical solutions definitely looks like some fire well let's see what happens great color good texture yeah your sake Wow Wow same pretty smell I got told him a tail yeah so I'm gonna be nice to you I know CPS at one point came out with some concentrates anything I may have tried him once twice I honestly didn't think that much of him this is the exact opposite in the spectrum this is a top self concentrate and she was [ __ ] fired that she tastes great a great exhale freaking a medicated [ __ ] right now yeah he's just that's level I fry with a advance crunch crumbles on pastor miles home 100% setup totally equal as far as quality goes that was great I honestly love the texture I love the taste the aftertaste is fantastic um there's very soft and easy and throat and the chest and yeah good job whoever the [ __ ] you've hired to make these concentrate the best thing you get it's [ __ ] done so make more crumbles now CPS and [ __ ] oh you're [ __ ] crumble for him I would love to try

absolutely love the crumbles love them fantastic great fantastic I'm glad my phone is ain't order smart hi guys mouth cheese", "PFTXi3B7fSM": "yo what's going on everybody chief necro here yeah and I have a new strain review for you today it's called GG for our gorilla glue fort now this is a hybrid it's more of a sativa string and it doesn't have too much CBD in it but it's depending on who you buy it from it has like a really really really good THC content so let's go ahead and get this one started alright so we got this started camera right here so y'all can see me better we've thrown some tunes you gotta have tunes man I see well nice G nice excuse me gems from grammatic if you want to know what video I'm listening to it's jazz hip-hop versus trip-hop dramatic style video the group companion number 4 anyways this gorilla glue it's actually really chill man I really like the taste they wrote this pre-roll pretty well so dashing it's great I like it there's a delicious taste right off the bat I have had I've had a different type of gorilla glue in the past and it had more of a banana flavor this one he doesn't stranger well still pretty good I'm still here I'm not too stoned to speak really good strain it's pretty tasty too I didn't think I was gonna enjoy it this much I bought a second one of these bad boys I know I'm gonna enjoy that one in private but one thing I will say it's already starting to relax me and I just feel great overall this one I'd have to say is one of the better strains I've had so for sure this one nice I think I'm gonna give it a high rating it's really tasty really tasty I've been smoking but for many years so I know I got some good bud when I see it [Music] so I guess a rating I have to give for this strain out of 5 stars I'd have to give it about 4 stars I the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I think I've had better elsewhere maybe it was just the way it was grown but it's still great but I bought this from ultra health it's a dispensary a non-profit dispensary here in Sunland Park New Mexico so if you want to know where I got it I try to do dispensary reviews soon too [Music] I just gotta figure out how I would like it's probably something I should just do in private my spare time I don't know review videos anyways four out of five great strain it's really good if you're a newbie you'd probably like start bowing down to this stuff right here not even lying yeah so there you have it everyone that's gg4 or gorilla glue number four this is cheap and that Grover here staying high with you blazing with you my friend I will see you soon the next rain I will review is when to be red dragon so that sounds pretty neat so I can't wait to try that one out for you and let you know how it is sign off now peace out my friends", "2A3vtD2DvVY": "that fire look at that [ __ ] is that Gigi number four you would know", "tmScm2xmFNc": "hey there welcome back everybody this time we're gonna be doing a review on something you I have never this guy's hash before so I figured I definitely would do a video on it it's called super chronixx 206 as you can see he's got a pretty nice sticker on there for his labels I think he writes on the bottom and a sharpie this is Gorilla Glue number 4 hey I do that sometimes with like my bag size of the hash that's in the half like all right 70 you on the bottom of some of my hash cars but it tends to rub off so I'm not a really big fan of it actually met this guy at the dope cup on sunday who pretty cool guy nice to meet everybody met a lot of people actually met headhunter and just I slacks and a bunch of other people excuse me and that was a really cool event doesn't exactly what I thought it was gonna be I mean I always go to those events kind of looking for cool vendors maybe some glass vendors or some seed vendors or something cool like that there wasn't much of vending going on it was kind of just to hang out most boots are just selling their t-shirt and just giving away dabs from what I can tell did get some sensi sweet edible products to from the dope cup I'm gonna have to buy something it was like literally nothing to buy there thanks for food yeah these are Oreo bars it's only 100 milligrams but i'll tell you usually takes me about 150 to 200 milligrams to get a nice little buzz going on and these these guys really key carboxylate well or or just have a really good system because i really get wasted off of these and they have drinks to like tropical punch and lemonade stuff which I got a couple of drinks also yeah it was good terms definitely not what I expected they had like karaoke there on a big live stage which was interesting some people aren't shy to show everybody how bad they can see yeah I haven't made a video in a little while I meant to make one on 420 but things kind of got away from me so I figured I'd bust one out right now try to make a couple more videos in the next couple of days I have some definitely have smashed review I just took this out of the fridge it's maybe been out less than five minutes and it is just grease enough for sure Oh let's see how she presses out huh you guys want more metal make sure to check out a couple the other videos on the channel always melting up some good hash and talking about if you have any questions feel free to leave them down in the comments or you can check out the informational playlist it definitely has some frequently asked questions and terminology that we use here in the hatch community that's a good place to start if you're new to the channel like I said I know I haven't been doing too many videos I'll try to pick that back up definitely have splashed review don't have much else to talk about though other than what I got going on seems like this parchment it's got a hole in it and yep that's among the hair iron so mmm the smell definitely if you guys have ever tried the gorilla glue as that Gorilla Glue smells real OG lemony a little bit of funk I suppose really like this stuff it's one of my new favorite strains especially for making concentrates out of it grows amazingly but yeah the concentrates seem to come out pretty good this is definitely some juicy stuff always nice to see new hash makers that are coming around and and check out the material I always enjoy good hash no matter it makes it discreetly probably not going to be too long the video yes I don't have much else to talk about I'm going to be making some sift here pretty soon I'm sure I'll slopes along the show I saw brought that last batch of pineapple I mean need to do that too and I have some other stuff to review but I wanted to take another big fat damn pineapple on here as it is definitely one of my favs right actually hold this little piece in half little small now but that's the same size get it plugged the hole alright nice little wake and bake with guys you guys have a good medicated day cheers yeah exactly like it smells real strong terpene profile that lemony-lemon yum yum as you can see it's pretty pretty clean there's a little teeny bit of residue I would probably give that like a five out of six star maybe a five plus a lot of flavor was just on point for sure um I know this guy's on the shelf at Northwest alchemy he's got the gorilla glue and some girl scout cookies i believe so check them out for sure ooh definitely some powerful stuff loving that gorilla glue ah so yeah there were signed in that 1372 the I 1372 a bunch at the dope cup which is always cool kind of worried about medical going down the drain

holidays and all that kind of stuff and had a harvest in between so haven't really got anything started until now decided I'm gonna go old school one plant one light my SK 600 I got a gorilla glue here going or excuse me GG number 4 and a 5 gallon pot yeah she's gonna be veg and maybe for another couple weeks here she's probably about three foot tall let her get a little bit full before a flipper but that's what I got going on right now I'll post another video I got in the 10th I've got a mail gg4 and had some clones I'm going to do a little breeding project in there just to get some Steve seed stock going I like this plant so make sure I keep it around for a while and she's looking pretty good so far I've only topped her once I think that's all I'm gonna do I'm just gonna let her

the gorilla glue number four they've been in here about a week maybe a little bit longer maybe two weeks as you can tell they've taken root already they're starting to really grow no problem I just topped these ladies yesterday and they're doing good they're responding well I've a couple changes this time around we're still rockin the two six hundreds and the four buckets but as you can see we've done away with the overflow protection line and I went ahead and I up graded the bottom here too this is 3/4 inch line going across the bottom so it's gonna drain a little bit faster and that way you don't really have to worry about overflowing in general and I've got the pump coming on I think four minutes after yeah exactly four minutes after the feed pump comes on so they don't really have a time too much time to flood out completely and this is a eliminated a lot of tubing and plumbing etc and just junk in the way I've got the the buckets up on just these are just one by uh I think there's a one by four so it's just you know three-quarter inches off the ground that way just helps to drain a little bit better to the I call it the brain bucket here controller but no everything's taking off the plants are doing great really excited to actually have the gorilla glue in here as you can see we've got a different metal Howlett on the right than we do on the left and then one of the right seems to do a lot better so I'm gonna have to get another bulb here probably soon get that this middle highlight on the left this may be towards the end of its lifetime here no big deal well then that I'm stoked can't wait to get this get these babies flowering it's just this is an impressive strain to grow I cannot wait to see the potential and in hydro so not a whole lot well I guess it's got a quite a bit of stuff new stuff here pretty much changed everything again so like I said it's eliminated the need for I've got only one feed pump and say my setup here how the how simple this really is that feed pump runs out and goes into this line here double tees off right there and waters all for plants these are six inch they're hydro halos over here that it's another pumps a little hard to see some kind of darks in its play it's that is for the water Chile so that just recirculates water through this guy which is the water children here we've got configuration our feed drain timers you're going to independently adjust those and various other we've got the air stone water chiller pump and none other than that it's thing it's a beast it runs really well I had to plug up some of the holes from last time some salt calling there but no no everything seems to be going well with the new modifications and I'm just really looking forward to the next few months here you know this is going to be a exciting and fun girl so I'm hope you guys stick around and stay tuned we'll just keep on keepin on peace", "MLWuFzNtL80": "what's up YouTube it's a before Tony with

definitely a sativa it helps you train your mind to stay disciplined because if you can't stay focused on something then your mind is gonna wander all over the place and start running in spirals and usually at least for me it tends to be thoughts of a more negative nature i don't know why it's just like constant concern about everything and then i gotta continually remind myself that i am going to die and then that's the one thought that makes all the anxiety go away it's a great cure for depression i've read there's a in one of stan graf books he talks about how quickly people can undergo a complete psychological transformation and he uses the example of people who have jumped off the golden gate bridge and survived there's been a very small percentage it's like one or two percent of people that have jumped off the bridge attempting to commit suicide who just slipped into the water and were completely unharmed and those people afterwards described this new appreciation for life which they didn't think was possible all it takes is a few seconds of free fall being 100 committed and convinced of your imminent death some kind of miracle happens you walk away without a scratch

gorilla glue number four [Music] you", "yrNDuE_aI4A": "hey guys he done just got done with another day at work and one of her clients that comes in to extractor Depot a lot got us some of his amazing products some of this gorilla glue number four we are actually dabbed at earlier than it is amazingly strong and he definitely makes some fire and stuff and I'm sure when this company kicks off the war you'll start hearing their name but he's just kind of getting started right now either way it's really really good yeah we got Laura her fan more than anything that kind of really wanted to just see our opinion know what he's been doing yeah a lot of people come in and they ask us for a lot of her opinion on different things and you wanted us to be ours so we're kind of dabbing it at work but we don't have proper really proper rates to taste things there there's a big good one because again you know we actually know the time and this ring he gave us a lot so he gave us both the ground which is Shannon to him yeah which they were heavy grams it looked like Jack how would you describe this one savory but not cookie like I don't know how yeah I'll give a dead but we gotta keep getting better shatters really harder to smell definitely it was so strong oh yeah it is wrong Wow this is up there probably backwater damn some of that gold flavor is really really nice an excellent lingers yeah what would you say the flavor is like that one's really hard to pinpoint yeah exactly I yeah it's a savory but filling dock media from Platinum Widow is exactly what currently it's an extreme platinum widow grows differently but I know a lot of people like button 102 it is just like growth which I mean I was never around the age of but anything well probably I get imagine because you know everybody hyped up white play-doh so much and I did have it before it was a big fan of white with him was always $5 more grams in Hawaii if it's legit it's tough surely good he did a really good job eager at all he's got whoo definitely slowed you down yeah I said 80 lights that just don't fit yeah well that's probably is so much finer material I always see him [ __ ] pumping out further material I'll tag his IG in this video I don't know right off the top of my head but he posts a lot of his stuff on his I gene whoo man it's still like it ringing the bell in my head mad props there probably definitely not really yeah this is really really strong I didn't think a huge tab so man I'm not coughing that part but I can feel it good [ __ ] usually a grunt rim run when you're dabbing nut run hits you way harder than like a tree run wooden trim run might make me kick off more and/or just coughing you know not nothing a grip wouldn't but never and just hits you heard his new nails taking a whole minute today I'm just impatient ASSA Casa rig really functions really nicely especially for price range that the pipe Kingham heavy pressure behind the eyes hard to open them right off the bat yeah it's a real aye-aye-aye [Laughter] [Music] I actually said I would prefer that over I don't know be up there with this this is turkey stuff these trips off the turf sauces I like but they they just can be a little bit burdened folded AB and it's sometimes it's hard to get a big enough gap of it unless you have but the more the more saucy it is the more Archer it is the more turf field it is so that's why I always took the gold nugget good something come in that high cannabinoid full-spectrum extracts are basically the THC a that's still on some of the Terps in it is by far my favorite because you get the strong THC a flavor or hit which is having an int of the terms right just a hand of the Turks and then the Turks are we usually for me in general a lot of people see me coughing its kids a lot of our kids just really Turkey and that's really a lot of stuff making me coffee love it and when I noticed when I dad just like THC a or some of that that I can't avoid extract I don't cough as much though yeah yeah nothing wrong with a lot of Turkish wedding means no nothing nothing wrong if anything if I had a lot of a lot of material and the baby put half of it away into the jar then try to do this crystal sauce out of it yeah oh yeah make you have that happen oh yeah yeah if I have my choice you know my preference yeah it's good now you know we have so many amazing clients and people that we can get all these different types of concentrates and actually kind of bounce around I mean even this slit you just feel it is cool but this distil is definitely the end of the line like we're not somebody my preferred method of dabbing unless unless it was sick or something then we'll eat that well I mean if you guys don't remember back in the day I used to [ __ ] about this too it does my grab my trimmers used to be charged to the shops oh yeah this load was it's like 1550 a gram for all yeah sometimes not even higher if I recall yeah and and I use some [ __ ] I was like you know this is the bottom of the barrel you know you know now that we're an extractor Depot you know we understand the methods to make this and you know you just take the crappiest material running crude get big yields running through your row dough and short paths and you know you got yourself some distillate and it's gonna clean it up for you a lot and it's again like I said bottom of the barrel it's activated at this point so you know you can eat it you can dab it and smoke it nobody nobody is really tell you know unless it's really scentless that the the disc that distillate get makeout maker or guy or whoever did it properly because now that we've kind of actually went through the the whole process a couple times with the extractor depo class where I can see where a lot of people are having you know people's bump it all the way through you know just poring over how it's gonna go really fast but you're gonna have all this kind of [ __ ] going over yeah if you guys are into into it or even do it yourself you guys know we're talking about there's different fractions you get with it and then how people do that whether they clean it after the first fraction we got a vapor take off which is really nice so keep your vacuum and stuff so they also got our new new coil too so you know we got you know a lot of good ways to actually get through that first fraction and if in pending on how you move on from that first fraction then to your second fractions um is gonna be how your your smell and flavor is gonna be in a lot of people cut a lot of corners there yeah so I mean this is like it's really stinky terpene fraction people always tend to keep in their concentrate so yeah some people run it you know there's many different ways to run it you don't want to take fractions so slower do you do it and we'll talk more time you take the more smell you can remove out of it it's actually kind of cool to watch cuz the smell is actually stink colors are actually like blue and yeah red as a wet azulene actually yeah yeah so that's really cool and you can really see how it outwards once you kind of get benek you'll understand how like tech and patience and your machine that is a big big but either way but yeah but like we were saying anyhow it's a very cheap final outcome you can use cheap material get it so you know you're not it's not gonna be very valuable and gentlemen shouldn't be worth a lot so but you can use it for a lot of stuff and it's gonna be something where cheap cheaper material is gonna end up but yeah think of the bracelet starting down on it but you know basically right now it's all ending up in pens people are all taking it wanting to make pendants with it you can flavor it up into pretty much whatever you want so a lot of the people cut me and want to get it just for pens fans are popular derive terpenes and they're not and you know that obviously if you ever sort of seen the clear disc the lit come in to extract people you know let's get you on that right path we got charcoal so we got and if you guys ever you know come on in we can always get that going I know everybody thinks it's such a magical secret but yeah it's really especially if you have a short path just need a couple extra items a little Tech and you're good together yeah it's all I mean it's all the more time you invest in tier winterizing and polishing the more time you put into that you know hopefully you can get it clear near damn water clear on the first pass which is the goal otherwise the whole bottleneck isn't this

lemon with like a little bit of earthiness to it love you me beautiful takes man beautiful smell like I'm smoking it I'm tasting it I'm smelling it like I'm really in deep right now fire [ __ ] right here guys and I'm coughing but don't get that [ __ ] confused because she smooth on the throat but when that smoke hits your lungs and it expands and it gives you that urge to cough man it's kind of hard to fight that [ __ ] but that's how you always know when you got like a really potent pungent stream and like when you take the token you're just like stir let it hit your bloodstream and then it's a straight rollercoaster ride man I got to point out that this is not for your average smoker right here man this [ __ ] right here is heavy like right now I got the full face smell it's really around the eyes and my cheeks right now completely like head in the clouds you understand you feel much of my body at all I just feel like a calm comfortable feeling you don't I'm saying I just feel blasted in the face though so if you plan to set up with like a new smoker you might want to come with something else because this right here is probably gonna like put them out for young you're gonna dump smoking by yourself here I mean because whatever you smoke was probably gonna fall asleep or tap out or whatever you're gonna mean I promise I'm already loaded you know I'm just in the moment just fighting with you guys man and to be honest like I do feel like a little bit of fuzziness in my mind like creative cerebral euphoria that just makes me like kind of appreciate the little [ __ ]

"BcaM7Yj2n_E": "what's going on YouTube first off I like to give a big shout-out to God for letting me embark on this journey here in Denver Colorado for a person like myself it's like a kid in a candy store and let me tell you there's quite a bit of [ __ ] candy stores in fact sometimes you only have to go to a candy store your neighbor could be grown candy and he can be bomb at it too that's what I have for you today this is gorilla glue number four cross with monster cookies now this is the last of it me being the chief or that I am chief or southern land I ended up smoking more than I saved okay so I [ __ ] up but this right here comes from full milk clear dome another homeland was able to bless me with it and I was very very appreciative because this isn't something that you'll find inside of the dispensaries this isn't one of those they say not in your bag basically this right here if I were to give it to you and you were just to go ahead and put it up to your nose you would smell lime lime zest lemon peel would be very citrusy now you could smell a hint of sweet do you might be like what the [ __ ] is that kind of smells like chocolate cookie dough you don't know what is going on that is when the bus comes down once you break this bad boy but for some reason it starts smelling like a cookie factory of this [ __ ] like it just straight cookies like I mean like any type of cookie your grandma's cookie I don't know just a [ __ ] cookie a normal [ __ ] chocolate-chip cookie is what you smell no the chocolate is crazy on this because to me it's a darker chocolate that I'm smelling it's not like a smooth lighter chocolate or a milk chocolate notice a dark ass [ __ ] chocolate I'm smelling this was grown to perfection and even the [ __ ] way that he had he cured it is just perfect I mean everything to it is perfect you get the white ash I mean everything is flawless this right here is something I cannot smoke all day I will be zombify stupefied and my type of work I probably get fired so this is something that smoke after work or if I'm stressed or if I just don't want to [ __ ] think right this is what I smoke and on top of that it's not just to think right because this actually gives me a clear high so I can't say just that way but this would gives me one of those I could see a penny you know and think oh where did that penny come from and then I think of Thomas Jefferson the good Jefferson County and you you get the drift so that's what this [ __ ] does right here this stuff is beautiful still new to the whole you know dispensary scene and what I beginning a lot of is a kind of like the crush all basically can crush it inside your hand time it feels really dry this stuff has a little bit of moisture to it man I really like that I'm from Texas Texas boys you know sticky icky I don't know if you ever heard that phrase but I should you know we like that you know that [ __ ] stick you know I mean like stick let me [ __ ] you know of course all the dispensary that I've had a beautiful manicured everything is you know dumb right I mean the thing about it is for to me it just seems like it's a little bit more dryer than it should be now that might be the proper way for it to be but yeah just I guess out of preference that's just know what I like this right here I'll go ahead and take a little piece forgive my [ __ ] dark ass fingers I was playing with ink when I get high I like to draw on paint if you do too that's [ __ ] awesome show me some [ __ ] I was like seeing people's art because I have an artist and I feel like you know anybody can draw anybody can just [ __ ] get high okay so the taste it's really really spicy like a cinnamon you do kind of taste chocolate it's not necessarily a dark chocolate like you smell but it is a chocolate nonetheless it has a lot of spice to it I could almost taste a little bit of cayenne it's kind of odd but I do taste something very spicy kind of like I bit into a pepper yeah you could really taste the really dominant of the gorilla glue for if you're a gorilla go for straight you know it's like a really feast tastes really strong citrus like a lime zest or lemon peel I always like to give those those type of I guess the script is because as usually would you know just a common thing that people would even be able to pick up on what's crazy about this weed is like you know my first hit I could already feel myself getting elevator you know my second hit started going to my tongue you know that drunk talk the third hit I'm already feeling you know my height is getting a little bit more lower more focused I have really bad eyesight so you know marijuana really does help with that forgive it somebody's getting robbed in the Trap House out the band of some reason I'm just going off in their car but so this stuff right here is definitely a recommendation to anybody that wants to have the high in their eyes visit I'm sorry I'm [ __ ] looking outside seeing who got jacked no you start seeing the pain management side of this I apologize so we backtrack yeah the first couple hits it's going straight to your eyes after you smoke a little bit more I mean you start seeing pain management I really have a bad back and so a [ __ ] up car accident when I was younger and now I've been a little bit more years on mine I'm actually feeling it in and this stuff really does help the pain management I was really blessed to meet this guy and able to uh to get some of this and this stuff right here is definitely one that I would recommend I don't know anything else that I should try definitely hit me up I must at evil man I haven't got all into the concentrate just yet I really wanted to pay my respects to the you know the plan itself first really just trying to get to the roots of it seeing what team the best plant I really want to get a stronger Durham poison my homey amazing actually put me on some drug poison that was fire but so high already I really couldn't decipher from you know all the other we that we had smoothed at night but I definitely want to get some of that and I'll probably get a review out of that as well feel free tune in and hit me up if you have any questions or concerns own this [ __ ]", "xAUYzlvqfes": "greetings fellow humans it's suburban herb here and welcome back to my little world it is day 26 here for these two gorilla glue number four beauties last time we were here last time we were here uh it was a week ago or and the last thing we did was we defoliated and we started so we entered the third week of flower so with that we introduced bloom boosters so the defoliation of the bloom boosters were last week and i just thought i'd point out because i mentioned it i used this once i gave one application that's just canna 13 1314 and then i switched following that i gave one application of this which is a similar thing it's actually just uh powdered but it's part of the system that i'm using for this so we had it here so i thought i'd use it and and it has an interesting component where it has a foliar spray so you apply this four days later you foliar spray with this which is what i'm going to do this evening so that's kind of neat so that's why i was going to try it i actually did it with my gra last uh crop of gorilla glue yeah indoor they did great i don't know anything to do with it but i'm going to do it again just because i have it so that's what we're doing with uh these girls like i said it's about mid uh third week so that's what we're doing we're hitting them with the balloon boosters for the third week and other than that the only thing i'd mention is um i am feeding them basically every day uh pretty much every day i what i what i've kind of been going by feel so i've skipped the odd one but effectively i'm feeding them every day and they're getting three to four liters in these five gallon pots with a uh ppm of around 750 to 800. so not very high on the ppms however i am feeding them every day one because i think i have to and they seem to be absorbing it for the most part i don't know if the pots are getting completely dried out which i would normally do normally with these pots and with just a regular sized plant i would feed them about every 48 hours about every second day but with this because they're slightly larger and i i am slightly concerned that you know i'm not we're going to get uh a lot of popcorn here um i'm going to feed them every day and so the rest of it the other thing we're gonna do tonight four days ago we transplanted four five of our clones and here they sit so tonight so they've been uh as you can see the pots were watered otherwise they're just hanging out um so what i'm going to do tonight i think is clip off their sad appendages here so their first leaves that came from that they brought from the cloning so we're gonna clip those off and the other thing i might do is these final four clones they were the less least rooted seemingly although they look like they have roots because they look fairly healthy but we're going to take a closer look at them and i'm going to break them open and take just take a look at the roots just for my own edification so that's what we're going to do and uh we're gonna do the foliar spray as i said and we're gonna go take a look in there so uh we'll be right back go pro stop recording so i don't know how well you'll be able to see but right here see that prehistoric looking creature there orange and black that is ladybug larvae and look there's another one right there getting to work way to go buddy get those aphids my friend and i actually see another one right there i'm not sure how many are here but i'm glad they're here and working for me because i'm slightly embarrassed to say that i have aphids again now i didn't spray them because i had the ladybugs in here and i guess that's my reasoning but with just uh you know i don't know how many ladybugs were in here it might have been a dozen or something or so but uh they weren't getting the job done those aphids they multiply fast so i'm hoping these larvae who apparently are veracious eaters these guys can eat 50 of these things a day or like they'll they'll stay in this form for uh two weeks or something and they'll eat like three or four hundred aphids so i'm hoping that's gonna be enough because i've left it a little late or definitely too late to want to be spraying these buds but if i have to i'll do it because it's in the end it's for personal i don't think it's gonna do that much damage like i'd you know i'd be we'll see but i'd be more concerned about a bug infestation but i'm hoping that these guys are gonna get the job done but i'm not sure how many there are but i can see three from here so that's like 600 aphids right there so get the work all right boom we're gonna get to work two let's thought he was creeping around somewhere so here they are i actually haven't really even set up this tent but i have the lights on 18 6 they've been watered so they're just fine so what like i said i'm gonna just get rid of these old guys really should have cleaned these but i did not and now i chant all right this guy's gonna lose two okay let's be a little more careful than that okay so these were the leaves that they had as clones that are dying off so we'll help them help them out and it gives it less of a plant that the plant has to worry about feeding growing right now when it has minimal roots all right all right got lots of leaves there seemingly an extra one or two and then this little feller i'll just take off the one for now this guy's going to live elsewhere girl i should say okay that's that okay and then the other thing we're gonna do is look at these i really hate to do this it's how silly i am but i hate to kill these plants but i'm curious what the root's gonna look like now this one never really looked like she took roots much at all she never really seemed to have any growth how much light we get off this thing not much okay so here we go see what you got for roots in here suspecting not much and oh you got a little a little bit eh you were trying you were trying ahead a little bit not much you would have had a tough start now you even now you look perfectly fine but you didn't have much for visible roots there's one popping out there oh yeah there you go so you guys are fine do i want to plant you like you can tell by these that um they're looking healthy ish and like their new growth so they have some rootage there they were just yeah see this guy's popping up the bottom now yeah and you can tell he's looking reasonably healthy there hmm maybe i'll decide what to do with those maybe i will still plant them i don't know let me think about it okay so that's it that was kind of cool though so yeah a little bit of rudige but not much she was definitely having the hardest go of it out of the bunch and but these they're currently pretty healthy and these are all reasonably healthy too they look all right and we'll see these are clones of the clones and if you recall the original clones had some issues which could have been nutrient related or something i'm not exactly sure have no idea really but uh we'll see if these come out the same they this one makes me think that they might but because you can see that one side of this sprout is coming out is developed and the other one isn't and that was kind of what it was looking at we'd have one and one would be folded then eventually it would come out okay so let's uh we can pack this up i'm not worried about these yet i don't even have them under the light right now i guess i can do that but uh i'm not too concerned about it we're gonna just let them hang out here we got a flying critter we'll let them hang out in here there's no hurry she looks nice and healthy although just like last girl i might have to look this up but those leaves are super duper thin again just like last time and i don't know if that's it seems odd to me maybe it's not but you can see just look at them i didn't even touch them but i can see that they're just super thin super duper thin weird last ones were too though all right there you go lined up under the lights and getting 18 hours of light as i said they'll be fine probably feed them tomorrow so that's it for them and then we're going to come over here we're going to feed them and then just before the lights go off we're going to give them that foliar spray and i'll record that and tack it onto this video so gopro stop recording gopro stop recording oh this doesn't hurt the ladybugs why are they okay mr larvae mr ladybug over there i'll try to avoid you a little bit oh [ __ ] sorry ladybug where you went foreign okay follow your sprayed a little bit weird eh okay i'll do it oh there's a little guy right there too and the guy over there okay see how she goes gopro stop recording", "oXOPy2DhlFE": "hello fellow growers you're looking at my gorilla glue gorilla glue grow just begging her out right now see what I did was is took some yo-yos did a little bit of LST a little bit of topping you can see everything's starting to grow I like the way this grows it just looks like a little miniature jungle I can't wait to flip it and see what it comes out like but I think I transplanted this thing about three weeks ago and she's doing really good just about filling up that three by tray down there I said we're just vegging around I think I'm gonna veg if maybe

you'll feel really relaxed so this is some you know you just want to use when you don't got too much going on you know you're just around the house doing whatever or you know right hands or whatever

know assortment of gifts oh that's the best when you do like a bunch of little gifts a little sentimental how you doing you don't understand cards i just never understood the hype like to me a card is nice but it just you know i could i don't need a card i'll tell you what the hype is let's hear it sentimental yes you know anyone could go out and buy something true but it takes effort mental capacity emotions passion you know passion passion exactly that's good dude this guy with the passion oh yeah so that's what it is you know what it is i feel like i'm just very vocal about my emotions to begin with like on a daily basis that like you know how i feel about you i don't got to get you a call what the [ __ ] is that i was imitating you that's what i sound like i love you baby that was an a1 impression how's your espresso that took nine hours for us to make over me and uh young joseph upstairs lou foreign trend cough you mix up trenbolone and albuterol oh trend butyrol is not a thing no it's trenbolone see this is why i don't know [ __ ] about roids that's how you know i'm a true natty and um i didn't wait for the espresso machine to warm up and he pressed the button and it came out [ __ ] see-through it looked like iced tea and we had to you know that immediately reminds me of like when you're about to have ketchup and you don't shake the bottle enough and then you get that that like liquid no water oh and i love ketchup but the tomato water did it's like dog water dude i [ __ ] hate ketchup it's nauseating you're a piece of [ __ ] i love ketchup ketchup i could put ketchup on anything except desserts desserts don't you don't need ketchup on desserts dude i had wings last night from your favorite wings place do i have a favorite wings please it's like the wings placer no buffalo wild wings no the [ __ ] i don't want a dox can you write it on your phone why am i not or just yeah just type it on the top of your oh yeah good place i haven't been there in a while dude how was that i've been there in a while dude still you did i haven't been there in a minute player mad good well we were supposed to go when oh yes i know what you're talking about yo you're a silly guy it's a great [ __ ] spirit silly goose speaking of trend balloon or tren bologna what the [ __ ] it's called dude i've been slacking man i have been slacking on my physique on my healthy grind and it's time to put an end to this slack i'm slacking dude i don't feel good i look puffier by the week and you know people are still leaving comments like yo vinnie we're so proud of you and your weight loss i'm like yo i've been getting a little i've been gaining quite a bit in the last couple of days it feels like a bulking phase and i've i've been i've been eating a lot of mcdonald's i don't know if you've seen this yet this right here is the 25th anniversary pokemon happy meal and i ordered one the other day because it comes with a pack of pokemon cards see i got everything all ready to show you phil this was the pack that it came in i already showed you the cards pack very adorable right very easy to open too like for the little kids mcdonald's yeah mcdonald's crushed it with this one every pack comes with a holographic the most rare holographic in the pack or in the set i believe is a lovely pikachu card i didn't get that one i got a tertwig do you know what you should do for a short i already did it no you didn't literally already made one about this ordered on ubereats it was outside sprinted upstairs pull it up well okay we'll watch it but here's my idea this is probably different just circling [ __ ] mcdonald's getting happy meals until you get the pikachu hunting for the pikachu how many tries does it take to get the pikachu i don't know that's a good question maybe i can do like one happy meal order a week and just make them like every saturday i want you to stay in your car and [ __ ] keep doing laps like give me that [ __ ] pikachu hey it's me i'm back again pikachu and then pikachu it's just listen they're short ready they're short every three seconds just [ __ ] there it is you know what i mean every cut is just another another failed attempt listen we'll see what happens i just you know it's for the kids you know yeah it's funny it's for the [ __ ] kids i want to make sure that all the kids get their cards i wish i would have got the pikachu on the first attempt you know but you know we can't always get what we want in life phil yeah but yeah i've been [ __ ] eating nuggets and [ __ ] but today i'm gonna say right now on the podcast i like to manifest on our show today's the day i turn it all around it's not too late to regroup okay and this is a message to all of you guys is this camera really high today or am i [ __ ] tripping out you're bugging dude is it always at this height yeah bro this is like an aerial bald eagle view right here that's good because the lower you put it the more blob like we yeah i'm gonna say my chin's gonna look [ __ ] sharp crimson chin over here in today's episode valentine's day special sunday sauce but yeah i already remember what the [ __ ] i was just talking about um but it's gonna be sick oh yeah in the new year if you've already been slacking on like a new year's resolution or something it's okay just treat january february as the trial run there you go march is where it really starts dude march is where it kicks in everybody knows that so yeah i will be heading to the 150s pronto uh phil we finally got a sports prediction right on this [ __ ] show the bucks won the super bowl you predicted that yeah and they destroyed the chiefs i know like it wasn't even a [ __ ] competition it was crazy 31 to 9 i believe did you see the celebrations after they won they had a boat party in tampa they're allowed to do that oh bro tom brady was shithoused i would too bro he took the trophy the super bowl trophy he threw it from one yacht to another yacht i would do it it was [ __ ] hilarious put a spiral on that [ __ ] dude it looked like a beautiful pass put his whole back into it it was nice but yeah you know what it was it was a very heartwarming thing to see because it made tom brady actually feel human like he's not just this calculated robotic individual that's just an absolute savage of football he also just gets drunk like the rest of us and wants to have a good time when good things happen in his life and i love to [ __ ] see that did you see meat canyon's video on him i did not bro you know he likes to kiss his kids yes that's the theme that's the premise he does the animations right mean canyon yep can i talk about the thing that you told me is that did that happen yet it happened but it's not out yet okay can we talk about that or no sure phil's gonna be on his podcast right yeah but he hasn't posted on that in a while he watches sunday sauce that's awesome so he's probably like [ __ ] he spoiled it yo listen if you want to come on we just at this point i'm just ready to have like guests on guests i love having guests on i love just us talking as well but to some about like a third person that we're just like you know shooting this [ __ ] about stonks right like the joey d episode i love the amazing the chill vibes of the people that we know in our oh it's day-to-day i feel like we're the only ones that do that it's always like here's influencer x hello influencer how'd you get started here's mom's basement with keemstar and faze banks and we're just like yo this is brett yeah from college what's up chad what's up chad and brett how you guys doing yeah we're doing pretty good let's talk about jeff bezos and stonks i started watching this guy on tick i think his name is literally i gotta find his exact at so you guys can go follow him but his his whole premise is shtick if you will is that he just goes like yo what's up guys every every every it's your boy every every i think his name is called eric eric he just keeps doing it bro he is [ __ ] hilarious i gotta find this guy is this him yeah i found him okay at s-e-k-o-u underscore eric bro i gotta play just like one of his videos sure it's [ __ ] hilarious follow me on instagram bro can you imagine yo what's up it's your boy everybody ever ever ever ever vinnie follow me at the sunday source pop podcast i mean i would go follow right after seeing that dude i don't i love tick-tock i deleted it again again again yo you and your tick-tock strikes i'm getting sick of this [ __ ] because every [ __ ] two seconds pretty face with a small waist with a big bang and then butt cheeks in my face man i'm not complaining yeah i can only imagine that would be a viral video you should just play small ways pretty face with a big bank in front of wildie and just film her reactions [ __ ] just charge you across the room like a rhinoceros or i'd do it and just put my donker on tick-tock oh yeah dude wait weren't you going to do the i'm going to try to become famous on tick-tock with the least amount of effort possible or something i mean like i'm still waiting for that people were excited i was reading the comments besides to my personality man there's uh i'm above tick tock phil and then there's play the game fair enough fair enough you know what i'm saying like yeah i mean i'm a little lost but fair enough dude you gotta play the game to win the game we were just talking about this man quantity versus quality feeding the algorithm throwing [ __ ] at the wall making sure that it sticks or you know or until something sticks like we were talking about on my channel say i were to do shorts you said do a different channel well for clips if you're doing shorts see again it's interesting though for your channel if you like i i don't know if your audience would mesh well currently with like your regular affiliate stuff like if you start uploading short videos i feel like they'd be like what the [ __ ] is this you know what we're here for type of thing you know but if you made a separate channel for clips and shorts i think that has the best potential for it to like you know have a meteoric rise okay so phillion philly on shorts philly on clips well no you could put the shorts and the clips on the same channel probably i think it would be very simple to just have your philly on live twitch your philly on channel then philly on clips or shorts or the [ __ ] you want to call it i wish you know as youtubers whatever you want to call us they would just send out an email every month hey this is what we're doing to the algorithm you're the changes stop doing long [ __ ] focus on short shifts oh thanks you don't save a lot of i don't know a lot of a lot of time energy and vibes yeah exactly yeah dude yeah you're gonna you're gonna figure it out though and when you do when you crack that da vinci's code i'm gonna be there like yeah phil you did it man it's gonna be sick bruh bro it's gonna be absolutely sick i've been watching the bowser fury oh dude dude great [ __ ] game i beat it like three and a half hours i was asking uh people on twitter i was like yo uh do you guys want me to play the whole game tonight and they were all like it was like 90 of people said yes i was like [ __ ] it i actually i briefly searched like the full game play of it and i saw that it was around like four to five hours something like that some of them were like two and a half some of them were a little bit longer so i'm like i don't even know how long it's gonna take me but let's go for it it was like three and a half hours and it was a great experience really fun game so that's part of mario world 3d so 3d world when you open up the software 3d world's on the left and then if you swipe to the right then it's bowser's fury so they're like this i think they're the same game mechanics they're a little they're obviously different games but they're the same like engine or whatever i've never played 3d world like fully so bowser just goes on trend and then bowser goes on trend and he gets like all this ink and he just like [ __ ] inks up the islands and you have to get these cat shines because it's all like cat themed based on the cat power up there's a cat power up in 3d world where like mario turns into a cat interesting and he has like climbing capability and he goes meow meow and he hits people with his paws he's [ __ ] sick and then bowser jr is like you gotta help my dad he's gone crazy but you know my dad's still really tough it's a really cute story i've been playing dead space three never heard of that you and these obscure titles i'm sure that's like the biggest game ever i'm sorry i don't know i'm a nintendo guy it was like the king of horror on xbox i mean it's an old game basically you're a spaceman on a ship and there's like big ass [ __ ] zombies trying to kill you and it's super scary are they alien zombies i don't even know dude dude but i gotta play this i was playing with my friend matt so we were it's literally like you're in the ship and it's like pitch black and then you turn a corner and a [ __ ] big ass zombie oh it's like jump scares and [ __ ] yeah i can't oh yeah people want me to play like horror games i think i'm going to start like playing some five nights at freddy's and you should stuff like that i feel like daylight gives me so much anxiety i just can't even sleep when i watch scary [ __ ] i'll always find myself sometimes on the obscure side of horror youtube or like i'm watching movie clips that just freak me the [ __ ] out i'm just holding my phone but i'm like ready to swipe away at any point because i'm just stressed i watched a creepy ass movie what was that good night mommy that just sounds awful here's the premise good night mommy it's the premise oh god it takes place in austria should i close my eyes for this yeah sure okay go ahead two identical twins have a mother the mother goes to gets plastic surgery and comes home with a completely bandaged mummy face oh my god and the kids are convinced that that's not their mom that came home from the surgery oh i don't like this it's like an imposter i want to open my eyes but there are so many twists and turns bro is there a scene in the movie where they go goodnight mommy and the mom just [ __ ] stabs the kids you see i don't want to spoil anything yeah don't spoil it go watch i'm never going to watch this [ __ ] but definitely go check out good night mommy what's your favorite horror movie of all time psychological horror the witch actual horror martyrs wow i've never heard of it i think i've heard of martyrs maybe i always hear like the hills have eyes remember conjuring yeah isn't the original paranormal activity really scary too paranormal [ __ ] doesn't freak me out is it just because you're like a ghost killer that's like ghosts aren't real like if a ghost pulled up you would just haymaker that [ __ ] yeah like yeah luigi with his [ __ ] background and suck it up to the vacuum that great that game is great too i know luigi's mansion i couldn't beat it past a certain point so i gave up but it was really really [ __ ] good um speaking of space [ __ ] when you brought up that first uh game elon was on your best friend's podcast recently rogan dude dude [ __ ] love joe rogan dude he's gonna come up he's dude he's gonna be a guest next week oh yeah it's gonna be sick uh so they were talking about how um we're essentially going to be able to like just space travel in like three years get the [ __ ] out of here like go up into space and like come back down with elon's new rocket or whatever the [ __ ] and then apparently like in our lifetimes he wants to be able to like fly to [ __ ] mars and colonize that [ __ ] listen i'm sure it'll happen yeah but not in three years i don't think the going to mars in three years but i do think we can go into space in three years no we cannot i'm telling you he's gonna be like all right come on exploded i think they're supposed to though no that's what he said he said when you're testing the limits of how far things can go with space travel you need to push it to the absolute limit so you expect it to blow up it kind of makes sense okay it's like yo we really we're at the bleeding edge of tech we gotta keep pushing just to know what we can't do got you so these [ __ ] rockets dude and again correct me if i'm wrong so i'm not a scientist and i briefly listed this while i was chewing mcdonald's yesterday but the rockets go prepare for landing so they just go up and down yeah dude what what i don't understand is like when it gets into space is there also like a rocket on the top that'll push that [ __ ] back down it has to be right there has to be some sort of mechanic to push it back down yeah because it can't like turn around come down then flip back over and then listen all i'm saying is i'm not volunteering to be one of the [ __ ] test subjects to go to outer space second of all i don't even think i want to go to outer space how do we know that that doesn't just like [ __ ] you up i was thinking about that the other day it's like yo you go into space right like we we know a good amount about space but how do you not know like when our human bodies are in space in the vacuum of space when you get back to earth you're going to have underlying problems you know what i'm saying like how do we know uh we have like cell phones and [ __ ] microphones and computers surrounding us every day we don't even know what this [ __ ] is doing to us you're telling me you want to go up there bro to the vacuum of space bro that's probably healthier because there's nothing up there imagine imagine that's that's the key to like living forever just staying in space bro i'll be an astronaut one day it's gonna be a a hard life but it's gonna be the life that i choose you know i feel like elon just says [ __ ] right and gets so so many people hyped up about it but doesn't deliver for 38 years you know i noticed a lot it's it's just funny you say that we're gonna have the fastest cars in the world point nine zero to sixty i notice a lot when he's on joe rogan joe will just ask questions about like when he thinks things will happen and elon like always has like an estimated date but you're right it's like the roadster was supposed to come out that really fast supercar cyber truck supposed to be out yeah cyber truck didn't come out yet but listen the guy's doing a million dollars [ __ ] cyber quad did you see that thing that they no cyber quad in the cyber truck demo a little boy on the back [ __ ] puts down the bag it's like a four-wheeler the tron quad the tren quad it's for all the people on trend trend but was it trend below trim balloon trend and albuterol i like trend butter all better it does sound like it sounds so much better right yeah well we take albuterol for our uh our asthma which is technically a steroid i haven't taken that i take it like every once in a while when i'm feeling a little shortness of breath yeah i think everything he's planning is gonna eventually happen it's just sometimes i feel like the timetable isn't exactly accurate you know which how could it be this this dude's doing a car company a solar company a [ __ ] outer space adventure company and he says he still gets six hours a night i'm not even getting six hours of sleep a night how the [ __ ] is that possible i don't know dude yeah you know six hours i don't really find myself needing more than six six is like the optimal amount six is optimal that's all i really need and then i just go run eight companies that was a good impression that was all right it was decent i feel like i can do better um i'm streaming i'm pretty sure i'm streaming a game tonight you have to just peek in for a little bit because it's [ __ ] hilarious someone made a mod i really hope that i did this yesterday because if i didn't you guys get the behind the scenes of what i'm planning on doing soon someone made a mod type in mario 64 first person shooter they gave mario a gun and turned mario 64 into like a shooting game essentially where you can like bl yeah that right there bro bro i'm gonna stream this tonight and make a highlight video with brooks i'm so excited bro bro this has viral potential i know someone someone the person that uploaded it um is this the original uploader scroll down a little bit alpha red i don't know if that's the original uploader but the guy that made the game yeah the penguin oh bro first of all look how beautiful it looks it does look really clean yeah mix morris he made it so like the beginning apparently has this really funny skit and like literally shotgun yeah dude you can like change guts dude imagine like i don't want to see a lot of it i just briefly got the understanding of like what this is so i'm going to stream it hopefully tonight and uh i'm excited to see yeah that's hilarious i want to be surprised but are you out of your goddamn mind with this desktop yeah this is what my desktop looks like after i make a video i just made a video you know what mine kind of looks like that too i'm not even going to lie to you all you have to do is just really show all this and then delete you know you could like organize it like instantly by doing a double click right like if you go to cleanup by and then you could sort by type or date modified and put it all in like stacks for you yeah but i mean it's all going in the trash anyway damn she can't delete it all yeah dude dude i love how you just have like icons like in the left corner not even accessible it's because when i'm editing and i download a picture you just grab it off the desktop drop it in exactly yeah dude it's crazy the the new max with that a1 chip i know we like joke around about apple a lot this [ __ ] thing can handle editing better than my imac pro that ship is [ __ ] ridiculous really it's crazy yeah i have to go spend another four grand on a new laptop do you ever i mean if it if this works don't do you ever get like laggy footage at all or like does the program like um you know stutter a little bit when you have a lot of [ __ ] going on in the timeline i mean i spilled tea on my mac so oh nice i need to fix it anyway what happened what's wrong with the keyboard press my spacebar oh dear god phil no there's no click exactly that's got honey it's mad mushy dude that's got honey all underneath dude the [ __ ] popped it open tried to clean it put it back on nothing you have apple care yep you're good all right no apple care is great they'll probably be like all right it's 100 bucks and they just give you a brand new computer i hope fair enough i'm a little awesome fairy tale did you see the woman that got gorilla glue in her hair i was just gonna ask you about that because i saw your tweet that was like so is that how i have to get verified i'll put gorilla glue in my hair she got verified on [ __ ] instagram so what does i don't even know the story at all because i want to ask you was this an accident that she want to put this was on purpose she just put okay this woman ran out of hairspray okay i thought that gorilla glue would be a good substitute for hairspray so she [ __ ] gorilla glued her head and it vacuum sealed her scalp i'm not supposed to laugh right you can laugh now that that's dumb i feel bad for laughing but you've seen the video no dude i know she had to get surgery right yep oh my god oh bless her soul man she thought i was just gonna like keep her hair in place yep bro can you imagine the pain can you imagine the [ __ ] pain it's sad but like also like she's a 40 year old woman man gorilla glue gorilla glue that's not in the hair spray section you're supposed to use that like actual construction they saw that at home depot and ace hardware and it says it [ __ ] says don't put in eyes skin ears but it doesn't say hair and she might be suing gorilla glue i was just that was my next thought like are they gonna have to put now like [ __ ] don't apply to hair don't put on clothing [ __ ] beauty product she's okay though right yeah okay so she's fine so we could [ __ ] bro she got a gofundme she got over 20 grand she got her surgery for free which is nice yeah but now she's got a sack of 20 g's and she's suing gorilla glue i'm just so dumbfounded by the listen putting [ __ ] glue in your hair this is this is coming from a guy that ate a raw shish kebab a whole [ __ ] raw chicken and i didn't know that it wasn't cooked so that's different sometimes humans do dumb [ __ ] you know that's literally like me going to my dad's shed grabbing a saw and just chopping my arm off like what the no don't put the saw in your body and then suing the saw company yeah for not having a warning label yeah don't chop off your own limbs i thought it was pretty self-explanatory this is what pisses me off though society social media rewards [ __ ] stupidity because now she's verified on instagram she's a celebrity she just made a fat stack of money and she got the surgery for free but here's the next question will she be able to keep the longevity doesn't even [ __ ] work now maybe she's a genius maybe this is all her plan maybe to become an influencer she had to sacrifice her hair i wouldn't put it past her dude dude we'll see we'll we'll oh glue my head don't ruin the locks how did it well first of all by the way the surgery aspect of it what exactly did they do they just like acetone to get the glue out of her skin like it wanted to like go into her scalp bro look look at this video so this is her no it's not a choice when i do my hair i like to you know finish it all got to be glued so she shampoos her head watch this wait that's the glue stop it no that's the shampoo oh my god that was the [ __ ] that's how much you put on though no she's she's she's demonstrating right now that nothing she does to her head we'll get it out we'll get that's her hair dude oh it's shinier than a bowling ball my guy she looks like an amiibo in the me where do you go for that imagine walking into the [ __ ] urgent care she's like hey i put gorilla glue on my scalp bro i mean i i guess in theory it makes sense what is this show what are we even talking about bro let's see if she hit a million followers i can't take it man what the [ __ ] is this year this year is already more wacky than last year has 808 000 followers and she has a blue check mark next to her name what's her username i'm underscored d underscore oladi she should change it to like gorilla glue girl or something you know triple g just [ __ ] gorilla gorilla and gorilla glue came out with like a statement they're like yeah this is a tragedy i'm sorry this happened to you but we're not a hair product like i'm i'm i'm at a loss i'm gonna be honest with you bottom line thank god she's okay oh my god i wonder what like the worst case scenario could have been though you know what i mean like could could it could have killed her i don't know dude like if it seeped into her [ __ ] scouts or something all right moving on i've been having really bad neck pain why i i think i figured out what it is so you know i'm 25. in case you guys didn't know i'm 20 i know i look like i'm [ __ ] 48 but i'm 25. i've been editing my shorts in my bed right on my on my laptop and this is this is my positioning while i'm editing so i'm sitting you know in my bed my legs are straight like this and i'm like this hunchback hunchback of notre dame so i think the problem is i've been doing that for like what a month straight now and my neck i notice while i'm streaming i'm like i can't even [ __ ] keep my check posture yeah bed my neck's been cracking and shooting your chat remind you to fix your posture i think i have to get one of those neck pillows where i'm editing in my bed so i can just sit against the headboard and what's gonna happen is your neck is gonna get so used to that pillow your muscles and your neck gonna start atrophying and then you're gonna so you're saying this is just training me to have uh a [ __ ] big ass neck i'm like a cobra i'm saying if you use a pillow all the time for your neck yeah your neck is gonna learn to not no no i get that but if i'm not exaggerating if i'm not it works if i'm not using the pillow it should in theory then get stronger just fix your posture what i could do is go get some gorilla glue and just [ __ ] gorilla glue that [ __ ] straight up yeah so i can't turn it at all but at least it will stay firm right and up and then gorilla glue i have to put out a statement we are not a necklace oh [ __ ] i can't say i still can't even believe that man oh god holy [ __ ] so yeah shorts have been going well i started uh watching juan division yeah i'm sure you've seen uh my instagram stories or tweets about it oh one division's the best show ever bro it's tweet at me if you look like wanda and i'll be honest with you i was a naysayer i was like listen i love marvel i just i was never really into wanda and vision like their characters are cool but i don't really get the hype uh scarlet witch who literally i won't spoil anything on the show i'm just gonna say this she is so much stronger than like anyone thought i guess well everyone knew from the comics that she was strong as [ __ ] but like bro she's op dude she used to be nervous she's nervous it's crazy like in the show she's doing [ __ ] and you're like yo she could have did that in the movies where were you at when thanos was clapping everybody she she apparently was gonna kill not apparently she was about to kill thanos and then thanos was like open fire and then the [ __ ] ship started blasting everybody but that movie sucks so i don't really get well you have no taste you [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] but yeah so i was my my whole thing was like yo i want to find you know someone that can cosplay as scarlet witch before valentine's day so i put out a call to action right i said if you look like this please dm me and you got a dm didn't you uh i've got a couple dms listen if i have a date for valentine's day and we're dressed up as vision and scarlet witch you know it was successful so stay tuned for updates okay okay it's gonna be a great weekend um i have a really good vinny's ipod this week let's hear it so i found this song again on tiktok because i'm just obsessed with tick-tock and it's [ __ ] amazing i love you always you ever heard this i love you always forever near and far yeah and it's great for valentine's day so that's a great one uh soon may the welderman come some sea shanty music for your film is that what you've been texting me soon may the weathermen come and drink a sugar and tea and rum i just want to go on a sailboat and [ __ ] be a pirate yeah this is also why i hate tick-tock they just make the most random [ __ ] popular no sea shanties have been lit dude they've been lit for years i i just want a rapper to come out and make like a sea shanty oh it's gonna happen maybe every every ever we'll start doing some sea shanty [ __ ] uh then i got joker and the thief by wolf mother joe her and the thief and the knight yeah that's like the best song that i think about when i want to like if you're ever like at a casino and he's like let's play some blackjack in the movie and then that song kicks on oh my gods amazing i want to go to a casino i missed casinos have you ever been i'm like vacations yeah i've never been it's fun man i've walked through them you know free alcohol the whole time you're there because they just want you to get [ __ ] are you serious yeah and most of them i don't know if that's still a thing but i'm pretty sure in most casinos they just keep open bar yep dude it makes sense if you think about it because yeah they have to pay for the liquor but like one person can only have the capacity to drink so much and the drunker you get the more you're like you know what i want a [ __ ] hit yeah hit [ __ ] hit sir this is not hit yeah [ __ ] hit and then you know you just give the house all your money yeah smells like dirty [ __ ] and cigarettes and more dirty [ __ ] yeah and cigarettes but i love the vibe though you really do it's just fun you know all the pretty colors pull the [ __ ] he's [ __ ] sick and there's always the old lady that's just [ __ ] sitting there she's putting all her quarters in the machine she wins nine hundred thousand yep it's [ __ ] you see david dobrik's new house dude that shit's crazy hawaiian punch water fountain madness what's your take i feel like you don't i don't know if it's fair to say you don't like david dobrik you're not david exposed recently has he yeah what what do you do h you know ethan from h3h3 he's been doing like a deep dive on david because frenemies he's with trisha paytas are they actually friends like what's the story with that trisha paytas her boyfriend or if not fiance was the older guy what was his name no no wasn't she dating one of the guys yeah in the vlog squad right yeah but now it's ila's brother wait wait wait she's dating ela's brother yeah i'm pretty sure they're engaged holy [ __ ] what so ethan and trisha are literally what the criminals that's crazy holy [ __ ] how the hell did that happen so they they've been spilling the tea damn so like do we know what the t is like what what did he what happened david dobrik's house is just like a big frat house drugs oh jeez racism um i mean there's clips of like him doing like [ __ ] up [ __ ] it's always the people that are just like so happy and so friendly that just i mean but like you can see that from a mile away dude i didn't i had no i just seem like a nice guy i like to laugh a lot you okay is this is this like confirmed [ __ ] or is this just like alligator stuff i mean i watch the clips of the racism i could pull it off yeah i'd rather not yeah [ __ ] that but trisha said that he would be recording like a vlog and then if people didn't laugh enough he'd do a retake all right one more time from the top just act [ __ ] surprised energy yeah we need more god dude meat canyon has a david dobrik one where he like kind of pokes fun at like the giveaways and [ __ ] and he's like every time people think of you they really think of me basically saying that like holy [ __ ] you're famous for being my friend oh jeez it's pretty nuts i mean listen he's got a really cool water fountain that has hawaiian punch in it yeah there you go i want that from my house speaking of my house my appliances came in my uh my washer came in my uh refrigerator which yo you gotta come see the fridge dude sick got this really cool like futuristic fridge is it gonna make noises like when we record the podcast no this one's upstairs we're golden why does this one sound like a [ __ ] toyota camry trying to take off bro this thing sounds like elon musk's new rocket bro the problem is this thing's from like the [ __ ] 80s or some [ __ ] this thing's been down here forever are you gonna get a hawaiian punch waterfall i might have to in the podcast room dude all the appliances came in they got delivered yesterday this is why part of the reason why i feel like absolute death today is because my sleep schedule's so [ __ ] um i had to go to the house and wait for the company to deliver all the [ __ ] right while my uh my dad was at work so i was just like standing there not knowing when the stuff was gonna get delivered like they give you a window like 45 minutes out but you know things aren't really accurate so i'm just kind of like standing there waiting i brought it like a [ __ ] i brought a chair that could sit on well i'm just and i was scripting my video during that but i didn't sleep the night before because i had to be there at like 7 00 a.m because you know me i don't wake up i just stayed up i just stayed up bro and then when i got home i had my video scripted i slept for a little bit i basically took like a day nap right and then woke up film my video went live grind don't stop baby you know when the grind will stop but my ass is dead ever ever ever ever ever ever i'm asleep when i'm dead yo i'm sleeping i'm dead sleep is the cousin of death it really is yeah that's all i have to say on the matter that's it welcome thank you for watching someday i mean i had nightmares last night did you yeah i'll talk about it what the [ __ ] happened to my nightmare i was in an aquarium oh jesus there was thousands of people around me there were crabs phil biggest fear there were no crabs that's all i remember wait that that was the big bad nightmare they weren't just like regular fish though like these were some diesel-ass fish they were on trend yeah swimming around with their i also remember i was i was in spanish class and i was just getting like ridiculed by everyone because like i was trying to speak spanish and it wasn't happening dude i i hated those moments in school when you would have to like present and you had no [ __ ] idea what it was about and you were standing in front of i used to bug out at presentations i feel like no one would think that like me of all people would get nervous like talk in front of people right if i didn't know the situation if i didn't know what i was talking about dude i would get up there i'd be like okay i would i would always start with how about the weather huh just to like ice get everything nice and there was this kid that was not prepared for his presentation because he thought that he was going on a different day and the teacher was like no you're presenting today so he went up and gave a damn good presentation with nothing and the teacher was just like biting her lip like what the [ __ ] i tried to get him but he was too swift dude all off the top of his [ __ ] head yeah that was my thing too like i would be nervous as [ __ ] the entire class after like 30 seconds of being up there i would kill it but my biggest thing and every [ __ ] person that's been through school can relate to this [ __ ] it's when you're doing a presentation in class and you try to figure out in your head okay what's better for me to raise my hand and volunteer next and get it over with or just hope i don't get selected till the next class and then god forbid you get picked last and the [ __ ] bell rings during your [ __ ] presentation and then they're like oh you'll finish tomorrow then you gotta do both days horrible horrible dude what was your go-to were you just like let me get it done asap yeah it was more of like the let me blend into the shadows because if you go first you know then you have no anxiety the rest of the presentations you're not being compared to anyone you're only being compared to like the person after you but at that point the people's attention spans are [ __ ] gone yeah so the best though is like when you go up there and your best friends in the [ __ ] in the class and they're just laughing uh my presentation is on the winery in pennsylvania your best friend's just like and you just do one of those like try not to laugh while you're presenting i saw so many tick tocks and like viral clips you know pissed me off about tic tocs here we go what else phil here we go buckle up folks we're going to space someone will make a joke and there's no way of knowing who the original joke maker that is tricky well that's the whole culture on tick tock it's like you just gotta copy everyone friends and then you copy the trends essentially stress me out you're not happy about this i understand you should write a book called [ __ ] i hate and just write it won't even be like a novel just write down bullet points [ __ ] stealing on tick tock tick tock twitch not verifying me [ __ ] uh gorilla glue girl gets verified before meets all this [ __ ] [ __ ] that sets you off and have it at like size 18 font bullet point bold italicized i'd buy that [ __ ] new york times bestseller that's a good idea you could be the next hey big mike with a best-selling [ __ ] author dude apparently that book's really good i don't read but i do like having books read to me oh yeah we'll talk about that another day phil i'm a silly goose maybe i'll read that book yeah then make a commentary video on it imagine you re i feel like you'd actually read it and you'd be like this was actually very good good on you hey big mike dude remember we used to hang out with mike dude at the strip clubs good times yeah dude really good times no sick i had another thought today like right before we started recording because my [ __ ] mac every time we're about to record the podcast goes would you like to update this garage band like all this [ __ ] it's always always ask me if i want to update or download [ __ ] right and i never [ __ ] do like i'm the type of computer user or phone user if my shit's working i don't upgrade i wait till there's like five upgrades later and i'm like okay now it's time type of thing but they don't [ __ ] stop remind me later yeah remind you later i'll do it when you're sleeping and they don't specify when later is so it'll be in the middle of a stream it'll pop up all my [ __ ] the i'll do it while you're sleeping on the phone it did that to me one day and i woke up but it was like hello and i'm like yo i didn't reset my phone yeah it's weird in theory though it actually makes a lot of sense because obviously you're not using your phone while you're asleep so that would be the most optimal time for an update over the air i remember you have to plug your iphone into itunes remember those days guys i know it's all over the air as an app the music app now you mean or like itunes on my computer it's so boomer dude i haven't used it in a while because i use spotify now exactly that's what i'm saying but itunes used to be the [ __ ] man i didn't like it oh man remember the days of like you'd log on to aim and you'd hear that and the door would open and then all your [ __ ] homies would be on you just play like um log into myspace and facebook yeah dude i remember my myspace i i was able to change the html so it would rain money symbols oh when you get to my page cash baby cash baby if any cash before vinnie cash was invented before that nickname did i ever tell the people how i got that nickname in high school that was actually my nickname in high school like i always joke that yeah these call me red coca-cola cub vide no they didn't it's a joke you know but vinnie cash we were at wendy's one night and my uh i was working at the pizzeria so i always had like i had cash on me because i was like the only one working in the seventh grade or whatever the [ __ ] it was sixth grade and my friend's brother was like yo uh vin i i kind of want these nuggets do you have any spare cash i was like yeah dude i got you i bought him his nuggets he goes and all of a sudden it just kind of stuck kids always got cash out he's always got cash for the nuggets his [ __ ] guy vinnie cash hey fresh gorilla bleeding out of his pockets at the [ __ ] time like my friend's brother was i think he was like a junior or a senior in high school so he was like the [ __ ] right so to get a nickname from an upperclassman like that i was like [ __ ] vinnie cash hitting the whip before the whip was invented remember the song let me hop out the [ __ ] porsche yeah remember that dance the that was the [ __ ] in high school first slim huh what year did that come out [ __ ] porsche i can tell you based on my weight in a video that i danced in it it was it had to have been junior year my junior year so i'm going to say 2013 it came out dude what's that whatever happened to t wayne was like was that right was it 2013 click that five years ago dude so what's five 2016 no [ __ ] shot yeah dude no shot yeah dude i was in college this man was doing tick-tock dances in cops bro i was [ __ ] tearing it up at a delphi dude whatever happened to this man he probably still puts out music got more [ __ ] subs than both of us combined dude oh god another thing in the book i'm mad that t wayne is more successful he's chilling dude oh god he streams apparently does he really i should rate him i don't know what this is dude everyone's i feel like everyone's gonna be a streamer at one point bro odell beckham was streaming he does stream i'm pretty sure like pretty frequently on twitch right i feel like everyone is going to be a streamer one day can you [ __ ] imagine a yo original 151 thanks for the raid from odell beckham jr i got raided by best nest the other night who's that he's like one of the best smash players that's sick is he is he a fan of yours no i think he was just like all right guys good night let's raid this random person on the page that's dope by the way the the strat to go live on your youtube and then uh migrate the geese over to twitch a1 i know dude very very good you had like [ __ ] 400 concurrence in that twitch stream right three 300 that's solid that's that's great [ __ ] for whatever reason whenever i go live on twitch the people on youtube don't want to come over it it's it's this weird thing where like people like the platform that they like and they're very um they're very it's very hard to get people to want to flock over unless they a are a huge fan of you or b they just really like the other platform because if if if that logic wasn't true we would have you know you would have almost 500 000 on instagram 500 000 on twitter 500 000 on twitch like everyone would just go everywhere people don't do that they're like okay i'm sub to him on youtube he's going to twitch have a good day guys you know but a lot of people do like to come over and the more you do it the more people will want to come over so you know what i haven't tapped into let's hear it what's this untapped market i don't get how people get twitter followers twitter how the [ __ ] do you grow on twitter i actually think twitter is easier to grow than instagram because on twitter you can put out a tweet have someone retweet it that has a huge audience and then those people can check you out and be like oh he's a content creator you know you just gotta do like see i just tweet about everything but you know if i come up with an idea that i know will get a lot of retweets like you know maybe that should be your approach just like think about things that people will really resonate with that could be part of your book it's part of just putting out tweets about [ __ ] that you really hate you know and by the way i can't connect to the internet for some reason so i don't know how i'm gonna grab a grandmother of the week i'm gonna try attempt number two bro my internet has have you just been to getting like internet outages where you live no bro randomly at like three in the morning and if you guys know what the [ __ ] this is please let me know my my internet will just go out for like 36 minutes and then turn back on it's the most [ __ ] annoying deal dude it's the most annoying [ __ ] thing ever i have to sit there waiting like okay when the [ __ ] is the [ __ ] gonna turn on i'm in baby i'm in all right in the meantime anything else you want to cover before we wrap it up cause i'm gonna look for a grandmother of the week we got snow again i'm so sick of this [ __ ] i was gonna ask how's your [ __ ] back did you have to shovel like nine houses again the fact that my oh this is cool we got an update i'm going to read this one remember rory rory caracciolo same name as me yeah he actually just forgot to send the description oh so i'm going to read his description home array to read the grandmother of the week uh for rory shout rory he gets redemption you know yeah because we talked about his grandmother now well we didn't talk about it we put her did we put a picture of her on the screen i think we did that's what it was it was just a picture um but yeah dude the snow was just like the last time that snow on to the super bowl was f oh actually it's known again on what tuesday it snowed again during the week but the the time that it snowed on the super bowl was easy because it was just like light light fluff it was like marshmallows you would touch it the opposite of marshmallow was very soft yeah yeah well morphine also saw but they're like really squishy oh that other storm it was that was horrible it [ __ ] snowed dumbbells bro my [ __ ] back and like to get the ice off of the [ __ ] bricks you had to like get one of those shovels with the steel on the other just pick at it yeah it was a [ __ ] nightmare what are you doing tonight uh i'm streaming i am used to i'm used to recording this at like four so i just looked at the time it's only 3 35 it's kind of weird yeah it's already so i have all this free time i'm going to work out i'm telling you i have to get back on track i'm so fat it's disgusting i don't feel good you know what you know how i know go up the stairs and i'm winded no i know and you know i know how like i'm getting out of shape again you just you literally just wake up not feeling good when i was like shredding when you're cutting like you you definitely feel more tired throughout the day because obviously you have like less calories less energy but you wake up feeling like ready to go when you eat like [ __ ] the night before and you're like have a lot of salt content in you and you're just dehydrated i wake up today i'm like yeah i literally texted you i said yo come at two i need an extra hour dude i woke up and felt like i was gonna die like it was bad my eyes were [ __ ] swollen shut yeah i had to put a hot towel on my forehead i know so it's time to time to get back on the horse it's also depressing that i feel like i can't run because there's just snow everywhere and it's freezing and it's dark by five there's this guy i follow on tick tock another tick tock user he runs every day no matter what bro this man was running in like three feet of snow it was the craziest [ __ ] i've ever seen and it's just like so optimistically amazing he's just like get out there get for go for a run and the beauty of it i'm good like i don't have yeah i'm in my bed watching this like i ain't running today i think i'm gonna jerk off again that sounds great i'm gonna slap the [ __ ] out of my dick i just immediately thought of someone using gorilla glue to jerk their dick off thinking it could be like a lubricant and then you should get your hands stuck oh my god that has to have happened to somebody bro buddies using gorilla glue on their meat how do you know we never thought someone would put it in as a hair styling it says don't get in contact with your skin true you're right that saved everybody that was good but what if people can't read you imagine going to the doctor and you're like doc doc i can't get it off my [ __ ] hand i heard this horror story of this like crazy ex-girlfriend like the guy cheated on her or something so maybe she's not that crazy but she crazy glued his dick into his belly buttons i mean if it [ __ ] reached but that was me she put my dick in my belly button the horror was excruciating that's gotta be a rough tuesday it's just a wake up i think i have a bed shoveling my stoop this guy's got his dick in his belly button that's so [ __ ] a hog and a half dude that's a [ __ ] that's a [ __ ] sword from the [ __ ] zelda that's a link's sword bro it's a great game by the way that yeah whenever people use link on smash bros i immediately get a little aggravated it's it's just cringy play style i hate it think boomerang boomerang little tick tock puss boy have you ever used bowser yeah we have to have a bowser bowser fight i'll rock your bowser i'm telling you right now honestly i talk a lot of [ __ ] and i usually lose but my bowser is getting pretty ferocious i like him but he's just not one of my favorite heavies what is your problem with him what's your main complaint um my main complaint he doesn't have enough flair so you just say robotic well that's thing it's just brute strength yeah also it's very taxing on his smash attacks because if you miss you're just open for shots yeah he's easily juggled too bro when you ground pound with him he literally you see him go and get back up like it takes a good two seconds for this man to regroup but if he hits you oh yeah break the shield baby you're going down that's my favorite thing ever like i'll i'll bait people into using the uh the shield because i'll keep doing the the down tilt where he goes in his show down smash yeah he goes in a shell and they keep shielding and then finally i'll like go for the butt bounce attack the ground pound that one and then you break that one's hard to hit another good thing i've been doing i actually might make this into a short cuz i did like six times one stream you go to the edge when people are climbing back on and right when they go to get back on the arena you do the ground pound but you hold up so he grabs the ledge so he essentially spikes people down grabs the ledge and pulls himself up i know what you mean it's crazy it's really hard to time but if you can time it dude it's basically an insta kill do you know what's also underutilized as bowser the fire yes yeah especially for me i only use the fire like once that'll rack them up to like forty percent and they can't really there's only i think the only character that well there's probably a few characters i can get through it i know i think banjo with his bri where he goes like side b into you i think that can go through the fire this is the best [ __ ] fighting game it's dude it will it's been out since what 2018 2019 it's still going strong and all they have to do is update the characters yeah and a new character every three months every six months oh bam we got to do the sunday sauce smash 100 yeah we we pretty much are confirming i think we're going to have a perk for the members that we're going to do um smash bros on the channel and you guys can come play with us and it's going to be fun can we enable memberships now we can once we'll talk about that after the show but we can once that thing that i told you about once that goes through which is in any day now so that's going to be awesome but yeah um there's a really there's a lot to read um do you want to take it one paragraph at a time sure because i i think i could do it no you got it you could yeah i can do this okay so this is from rory carrichola we spoke on rory's nonna a couple episodes ago and he wrote yo my guy i'm sorry i'm a bonehead i had a little story about grams in the family i forgot to attach it to the pics of her and long story short when i came back to the email i attached the pics and the story apparently wasn't saved but what i meant to add was yo

memberships on youtube and subs on twitch it really is like the backbone of the operation you know people that are willing to support us and and watch our show and [ __ ] with us it's just that's that's the real mvps to all you guys out there that are thinking about it so we'll have that set up for sure once we get to the new house maybe even before that and then for another for like a perk for like the consiglieres or something they're invited to like the sunday sauce live show once once a month that's fine only the consiglieres can [ __ ] listen ah and listen if you're in the godfather

kitchen you know what i'm saying but now that we're making money the most profitable podcast [ __ ] yeah dude we gotta step it up a notch with the mafia scene dim lighting oh [ __ ] handles we should hire a girl to play a violin in the back for every episode live dude whoa we're in sync bro no i like that vibe a lot better no yeah it's that's what what [ __ ] set do you see that's just [ __ ]

you later soon may the weathermen come drink that sugar and tea and rum", "y24ZNP9l48g": "what is going on guys it's your boy be raised abs and we are coming at you with another video here today happy monday first things first let's get this pulled in and adjust it a little bit so we are lined up with me all right welcome in if you haven't seen me before i appreciate you stopping by i'm be raised dabs brayden and today we're doing another strain review i was gonna make it a surprise strain review but it's kind of going to be a surprise for me it's not really going to be a surprise for you i'm just going to reach in the bag and grab one of the two strains that i have yet to smoke and whichever one comes out is the one that we're going to be smoking today so there should only be there's only two two strains left we have the the green and the white package and today we're going in on the green yet been open but the strain name that we are smoking today from the green organic dutchman ltd i actually have stocks with them which is kind of cool uh that's a little bit intriguing is um organic gorilla glue number four or gorilla blue number four bio mc so okay we got 41.33 milligrams of thc total thc is 196.90 this flower was packaged on october 13 2020 the one big problem that i find when i go to these dispensaries is i am never getting my product like being that i live in a small town they can only move so much of their product um so connie you're almost better off to go in there and like what is the most purchased product that you guys sell give me one of those because if you do something like that your chances of getting a newer badge date are a lot higher than if you go off of what i do i go off of like high thc content strains that i know that i definitely wanted to try this so this organic gorilla glue number four was something that i really wanted to try and it was packaged back in october so it's that tells me that not a whole lot of people are coming into the dispensary and buying the gorilla glue number four just because it was packaged so long ago that if they were flying flying through these and they were flying off the shelf then this would have been packaged probably last month and not last year but with that being said um i hope that it's good so you guys can tell we haven't gone into it yet at all and uh we're about to so let's get into it boom i do enjoy the smell coming off of this jar i'm not gonna lie that had some good nose as soon as i punctured it that had some good nose so we're gonna open this jar right up the nose is still there and weirdly the buds are still borderline sticky like i am very surprised no boveda pack in here folks we have no hydration pack in this container at all and we have buds that are still borderline wet like i can feel the crystals and the trichomes all over my fingers so that's a good start and yeah so we're going to get into this i am pleasantly surprised the nose is good the texture is a little bit wet for my liking i would prefer it a little bit drier than that but i mean hey i'll take i'll take a wetter butt over it over a two dry bud any day of the week because i can dry my butt i can't it's hard as [ __ ] to rehydrate it well it's not but it is you could sauna room it which is something i do lots but it's just a pain in the ass to have to rehydrate your buds especially getting it out of like a dispensary or something like it's never something that you would wanna or should have to rehydrate it should be coming to you as a top quality top standard for canada every time and i notice a lot of times it's not like that but i've been very very pleasantly surprised with the bud that has come out of our hometown dispensary um they named it ideal buds and the owner of it the owners are quite cannabis friendly they're pretty pretty good cannabis advocates um they're older too like so i think what they did was something very well they did they did what they wanted to do and that was to bring in some of the best cannabis that they could find into our little crap town which surprised the hell out of me because every every bit of bud that i've got out of their dispensary has blown me away as far as dispensary weed goes yeah we're still paying you know pretty high prices for it but they can't charge any less of what they're allowed to charge you so i mean that's bottom they're getting their bottom line they're not making a whole ton off of everybody from their buds they're just selling it for what they're allowed to sell it for with that being said let's get a hoot of this gorilla glue number four organic into us from the green organic dutch company i believe this the green organic dutchman ltd we got the dr dabber switch loaded up here all ready to go on a low temp setting we got it in the high blues the reason why we went with high blues is because we are looking for flavor today this is what we're looking for we will i want to pull the most flavor out of this butt as i can get so we went with the crying sheridan flat cat we [ __ ] it's already smoking um lots of chem oh very chemi on the flavor first hoot i'm noticing already the high's starting to settle very i don't want to call it mild what's the next step up for mild i don't know that's not a mild high but it's not hitting me like a truck either it's one of those in between nice medium highs and that was only off of one hoot one little whomper here so that was good start okay so that's finished one thing that i will mention is that i did enjoy what that's so hot for the blue setting the blue setting is only supposed to go up to like a few hundred degrees hot wow that was hot i was literally melting my turquoise get you guys a little bit better of a look on this bud here one thing you'll notice is the nugs are not ginormous big cola nugs but we are looking at some pretty fair fair quality flour whoops there well now that my face is back in the proper whatever you want to call it and we get a nice little hootsuite of this gorilla glue number four i'd give that a nice six and a half out of ten i'm pretty sure i paid a pretty penny for these for the gorilla glue number four i believe that was one of the highest priced uh products that i bought i think i was coming in at sixty dollars for har and the high was nice smell was good buds were fresh i was beyond surprised with how fresh the buds are the only thing that could have made this better was if the buds were picked fresher so to me when i'm looking at this gorilla glue number four i'm noticing the buds are starting to go brown and i would have really liked to see what this come look what this flower looked like when it come off the plant because i i would guarantee that it had a nice lighter green tone to it and it's just it's starting to look old it's just started it's starting to look old i bet i bet this flower had a real nice look to it when it come off the plant and uh it's starting to lose that as for the nose was still there i was pleasantly surprised with that um as for the smoke got me pretty stoned one pot like one little one of these we are gonna load another one up and uh just try and wamp a nice big cloud off it for you guys and then we're gonna smoke a dab of these uh caviars that we tried the other day because those caviars are tasty i i really enjoyed the caviar i was super surprised i i bought some live resin in one of my previous videos and tried that out for you guys it was just terrible it tasted so bad and then i had i had a cartridge that i had also tried and that tasted just absolutely terrible as well so i was beyond surprised to get some really good oil in my opinion and some fairly good flour as well it's a nice change of pace so go in on this crank that up to a nice mid-tier green yeah we'll go up to that mid-tier green and then we'll boom start getting her round ready to rock boom we're already getting smoked like it's already starting to smoke the bowl maybe i pack these too tight maybe that's what it is for those who know anything about these dr dabbers they absolutely rage oh my god whoo getting good and baked up in here for this video folks hope you guys are smoking along chilling blazing slapping that smile on and having an absolutely killer day we are having a good day and you guys know it'll be an even better day once we get this dab into us gonna scoop it out with this happy time happy happy daddy shovel and then uh after that we're gonna go have some lunch i think get this video edited up you guys see that um nice little globby there you go for a little more nice little daybreaker dave brightoner call it what you will not a huge dab not a small dab kind of again one of those in the middle today we are just full of the in the middle stuff all right folks we're gonna get all torched up we will be right back and uh we'll get into this dab for you guys thank you all for stopping by if you're uh chilling and waiting for me to smoke this dab i appreciate you if you liked the video down below i appreciate you if you're subbed to the channel thank you very much let's keep growing and let's keep this grind on i appreciate each and every one of you all right everybody you know what it is you know what we're doing we got the dab right set up here we got the toronto framework and revolver got a dab of some delicious caviar what a day these are you know just if a guy actually takes the time to sit back and appreciate the little things in life days like these are the best when i can just come hang out do my video thing for you guys chill just get get baked and just have a good day like this some of the best days that i have are spent making these videos i tell you i tell you so it means the world to me that you guys keep coming back keep watching them keep liking them and keep commenting i just love it i love reading them love replying to them i'm i'm always heart in the comments i love it so i thank each and every one of you guys that watches these videos uh and just chills out and gets baked with a guy like me thank you it's awesome and if you enjoy the videos that makes it even better because that means what i'm doing is worth doing so and i couldn't complain for that so thank you guys if it wasn't for you people these videos probably wouldn't uh probably wouldn't still be a thing but they are and we keep growing so cheers little little gun a little little deep throaty action there [Music] oh these [ __ ] duck these dabs taste almost like lavender and i really like lavender i love that smell so these dabs taste really good to me oh morgan just stopped by with a joint but that is the end of my video yeah thank you guys all for watching if you haven't already subscribe for more stay lifted and positive have yourself a great week and peace out", "sbHjiR_ONxM": "what's up guys Michael head grow we were coming back at you with an update on day 50 I believe last update was on day 39 I think and I was talking about and showing how the plants looked like they were kind of getting a little bit of a premature fade a little bit premature yellowing on the animal cookies and the Gorilla Glue now man the animal cookies have gotten to the point to where definitely a little more yellow that I would prefer and they actually seem like they're finishing off a little faster than you would normally expect or I would normally expect and I mentioned on the last video that you know a day 39 there was still time to give them a little bit of a boost and try to correct that to some degree and to be I'll be completely honest I actually cheated a little bit and I used a bottled product the bio Kanna Vega or no not Vega the florist the flower of the bloom of that particular nutrient line and tried to give them a little boost in that manner and that also gave them a little bit of a alfalfa tea to try to help with the lacking nitrogen to some degree and I'm kind of thinking now at this point I'm not 100% certain I have some theories but I believe that there might have actually been a little bit of a pH issue within the soil I've mentioned that despite the fact that I do grow in a beet for organic soil I do still pH my water when I'm watering so it's not an issue there although getting in the actual specifics of what this particular batch of soil has been through would probably take for a wheetly a separate video in its own so I'm not gonna go too far there but I do believe now that it probably is a little bit of a pH thing maybe like a slight pH lock to some degree if you want to call it that and this garden really it's I can definitely tell that it's not too full potential and that's not to say that it's not gonna finish out to end up being a pretty good garden but aside from the premature fading that we're seeing also I've just kind of noticed that there's a little bit of a lack of aroma usually at this point add a 50 by now usually you're getting just the [ __ ] loud in-your-face punch from the gorilla glue number four as well as the animal animal cookies to some degree and although the aroma is definitely there it's still gonna turn out to be pretty damn pretty damn good quality product you can just tell that there's definitely some room for potential and I mean there is still time left so I mean that could change who knows crazy things happen at the end of Gardens within the last couple of weeks so maybe I shouldn't be getting too worried about it I mean and I'm not worried at this point you know it kind of is what it is I don't believe that there's a whole lot thing that could be done now with the garden at date 50 but at any rate it's not gonna end up being my best garden I know that but I've definitely had worst garden so it's not the end of the world but I think that's really about it I didn't want to keep this update too long because what I'm going to do after I get done talking here I'm gonna add in some clips from just kind of going around the garden I know some folks wanted to see some more close-up shots of the plants rather than me just kind of rambling away so I will probably edit in three or four clips of just kind of going around the garden showing colas from both strains and you will see what I mean by the kind of premature yellowing that you are seeing in the garden and you know what kind of I guess we'll just kind of see what happens and write it out to the finish line I don't think yield is going to be necessarily a really big concern the gorilla glue definitely is packing on the weight at this point and the animal cookies really has impressed me with the size of the colas at this point in time so I think we'll be good there and oh and another thing that's kind of a bummer too is sometimes the gorilla glue will finish off with just this crazy fox daily structure with which isn't bad it's not exactly desirable for me and that's kind of a result is the planets still being a little bit taller than I would like them to be and I probably could have done a little bit better of a job arranging the plants throughout the room which there is still some time left for that to try to combat that Fox tailing to some degree so but anyways I think that's about all I have from now add me on Instagram username Mike oh hey grower I'm gonna be throwing up some pictures of some dried shots from the Bodhi tester selection run as well as a couple of other strains there so be sure to check that out and if you have not subscribed make sure you do and I think all my subscribers so we'll see you next time and now we'll go to the clips of the close-up shots so see on the next update peace out [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]", "zya81Yqp2A0": "yeah guys doing this is Neil from perfect Sun LED calm and I have a new update for you guys here so they see two out of flowers that have finished this is the gorilla glue honestly she was probably finished like a round a 78 or so she took about ten extra days than what you normally would and that's because of the trick that I teach which is basically just a watering technique of nutrients you give them 10 days of bloom in the very beginning and then you switch to grow and you do grow all the way up until she's actually flowering like actually has white flowers and they switch back to bloom and that will give you about an extra 10 days on out of flowers so a definite comes in handy now with this strain it doesn't benefit too much from it um but then again she had kind of a rough run this time and you know some mistakes were made and so the plants had suffered a little bit but even despite that the plants still got the sizer should be so that is this isn't a very big plant anyways that is the strain isn't one that gets very big so keep that in mind it's about a 2 to 3 ounce strain if you get 4 ounces off it that's really good so don't expect whole lot from this but there's a lot of benefits to this to the strain so you can see there she's a good size you'll see the size of the buds here right now as you can see she can't get her handle right around that middle bud and these other butts down here aren't too much smaller the banana size so they're so pretty good not bad at all and she's pretty frosty as well so that's a good one a little bit too long that's why some of these these smaller leaves here are because it started to cannibalize itself like plants do when they're finished so we let it go a bit too long just because we don't have the time to take it down so we got it down later than it should have but either way yeah it did exactly what it should do and so in some of the benefits of this plant or that one it doesn't need much light it's not a light hungry plant and therefore it doesn't need as much food although we feed it the same as everyone else has just it's too much trouble to try to feed all your plants different amounts of food so we just give them the same amount of food and it handles it just fine there's a little light stress there on the top of that but if if you're if you're doing only this plant you're doing just a Gorilla Glue by the way this is Auto Gorilla Glue by fast buds if you're doing just a Gorilla Glue run then you can actually lower them on a nutrient really easily because you're gonna be feeding they're all the same strains they're gonna be feeding them all the same and just do like you know point to less than what you normally would and that is easy and you're gonna see you know she's still gonna thrive and love that do make sure to obviously give her enough light though you don't want to use some cheapo light that doesn't have that much light if you're using my lights you know this was great you can actually just raise the light a little bit higher this is a short plant as well it's not gonna get very tall so it's easy to keep the distance away from the light so instead of keeping the light like about 20 inches away from the plants anywhere from you know around 2 feet is usually normal try to go like 2 and 1/2 feet or instead of 24 inches maybe go I don't know 28 inches or something like that you can go a little bit higher which gives you a little more coverage or even you know like I said go to 2 and a half feet above the plants and you can also have the plants go out further so instead of just covering a four by four you can easily put this in a five by five area no problem these plants will thrive in that in my lights anyway then my next yield and and the Goliath v2 will cover five by five and flower anyway even at the 24 inches away which is what I recommend if you want to do a 5 by 5 but yeah so they don't need it much like Miami bill go farther than five maybe five and a half by five and a half feet or something like that so something to consider but you know I would expect an average of about two and a half ounces off this plant if you grow a bunch of them you know you can probably put nine of them pretty easily you know in a five by five area or even in a four by four area under under one light or even under like a thousand yhp s you might even built go away at the 600 600 PS and with the 600 HP s covering a 4x4 you can probably still get a decent yield off these things you ought you should build a pull a pound off of them if you had nine nine plants you should get a pound pretty easily I think that's only less than two ounces per plant which would be no problem maybe maybe train them a little bit just to try to get them even you want these buds to be even with this butt up here and naturally wants to kind of grow like this so if you just do a little bit of training to bend the top plant over and the very beginning of the life just to kind of just give a mild mild low stress training so that the branches are all even all around the same height and then that would be easier then you might even want to cage them use the tomato cages to keep these branches from extending outward or just tie a string around them so it kind of pulls and makes them more narrow if you're gonna have that meaning in such a small space I'm gonna be packed right right densely next to each other if you do nine plans and a 4x4 but doing that you should build it at least a pound like guaranteed a pound even if you make mistakes and stuff you should still get a pound and you can get even more than that if you get an average of three per plant that'd be really good so that is an average of three ounces per plant okay let's go look at the next one now so that was the gorilla glue by fast but it's out of flower the next one we did is the Northern Lights mountain lion sound why I just said that I meant New York City Diesel sorry so the New York City Diesel and she went a little bit too long to again weed it's just a matter of time having the time to take him down so she should have came down you know probably ten days before we finally took her down but you see the New York City so what I like about New York City still is it had the shape of the butt so you can see here about the same size is there the one maybe a little bit smaller that top but but they're all all the other butts are a little bit bigger so they kind of even out more and there's and there's more of them so they can see look I think this one is that one's actually bigger than the top one so really really nice size now this plant actually has potential to be much bigger than this the butt should be a lot fatter than this there are still pretty thick though but it definitely has the potential to be much bigger than this again it was just she had some issues growing this time didn't do certain things and it didn't follow the checklist got a little bit lazy and that's what happens so don't do that make sure that when you guys are following my grow program too if you get my book to actually print out that checklist or you know you can actually pull it out of the book and then or if you have the digital book just you know just print it out if you have the physical book just make a you know scan it make a copy of it and then print those out print the copies out because you don't want to like keep checking over the one page it's only one of them so make sure to print out a fresh copy and you can do that anyway that checklist is super important to check every single day so every day you go in there don't think that oh I know everything everything is make sure to go in there and actually check that think see this want to have some good frost to and the the last one in there that isn't quite done yet and this one the hairs look so much orange ER and redder when it was like ten days ago so that's what happens if you wait too long the the color isn't as nice so but she has a really nice color otherwise I mean she's still nice-looking but if we were taking her down ten days ago the color of the hairs would've been nicer but anyway so that's one thing to think about but yeah so we're look really nice plant and normally that like I said this plant would get thicker buds and this is a pretty you know pretty good yelling plant so this is my I think Sierra New York City Diesel is by advance seeds I believe is that that's what that's who that one's by so it's really nice strain I got it for free it was a freebie seed so figure - will grow see what it's like and yes so we'll say at the smoke like if the smoke is good then I think it's worth growing again as long as she likes the high it gives everything and it helps her medically that is if it helps her nausea her chronic nausea and back pain then I think it's worth trying this one again you know yeah so we'll see it definitely has potential to be a good a good yield or so it's all a matter of the flavor and you know how strong it is and the kind of height is fits if it's a good one then we'll let you guys know and the reviews look all this hair is it has a lot it look at that a lot of hair so that's nice it usually means that you're gonna get a nice high out of it usually I think it's more of a cow a lucky but we'll see all right cool Inc see all these CVS is just letting go too long before you finally get it down get all these like yellow leaves but it's fine because those leaves are gonna snap right out and instead have a nice color to it that is all this green got a lighter green because we let it go a little extra long we can get that same look by just feeding it water like you know still harvesting when it's actually ready but start feeding in water and do that for like a week and then you'll start getting the same thing happening so we still we didn't feed at water for a week anyway alright so that's the update that's the New York City diesel bad man seeds auto flour and the Auto griddle the Auto gorilla glue by fast buds the guerrilla glue we've grown more than once it's definitely a good strain it's not a big yield er but it's an excellent strain really really strong very very crystalline ice bag appeal so good flavor all that it has everything you want in a smoke so super good stuff and I would put it up there with a lot of photo periods it's just excellent stuff we don't know about this one yet never tried it so I'll have to wait until we do review on this one on the New York City so to see how good it is but we'll see and we saw one more left so we have the afro DITA that's all that's left and that will be coming down soon the afro divas is not packing on the on the crystal it's weird and she's you know she's going way way too long I don't know why she's not done yet it's really strange that plan is not supposed to be a plant that takes forever and it's not supposed to be a big plant or anything and she's actually a decent size but that's a strange that she's going so so long I wonder if the stress just really freaked her out and now she's doing the opposite usually it makes them finish faster I wonder if it's done something weird to her and it's like I'm never gonna finish now but we're just have to cut it down and see how she smokes cuz she's just not packing on the frost and based on pictures I've seen of that one growing it's supposed to be frosty so maybe we just gotta wear phyno or something like that maybe the I don't know what's wrong with it but whatever we'll see if it smokes good or not and I'll show you guys an update of that one soon - alright until next time double peace", "rWbsLr4hj7M": "greetings fellow humans it's suburban herb here and welcome back to my little world i wasn't planning on recording today but i started filling with the plants so i figured i'd better uh catch it before i do much more so it's day 38 of flower i believe so what i did was i actually just i started shifting around with the base i actually took out one of the little sort of an inch type riser thinking it would help sort of balance things out here sort of whacked things out and then i messed with the upper uh scrog net here and things kind of all shifted so that being the case i decided since things have kind of all moved some cases are just they're just lying in a completely different way than they were um i think i might just take this opportunity and do the day 42 little defoliation on day whatever it is let's just say 38 so that's what i think i will do since uh basically unintentional but since this has shifted and basically you know all the colas have kind of shifted around kind of thing they're leaning in different ways than they were i may just uh start peeling off some of these leaves so i just thought i'd capture it here before i do that so like i've said a few times i'm just trying to catch every single thing i do so full disclosure this is why i grab the camera are we there we go clipped off of it like about 10 leaves while i was messing around there like okay it appears like i'm going to defoliate so that's that um i'll i'll give you a look after i've i've defoliated and sort of hopefully straighten things out a little bit okay that's it gopro stop recording here we go my friends we have defoliated so it was i would call it moderate some people might think it's crazy town but um uncomfortable with what was removed and what's here so we'll see how it goes we'll see what happens i mean we're testing things we're learning things so this is what i took off not too too much but some there you go we'll be back in a few days when we have something interesting to report gopro stop recording okay since you didn't let's go and take one closer look looking pretty good gopro don't leave me go bro all right all right gopro stop recording gopro stop recording greetings fellow humans suburban herb here and welcome back it's day 41 of flower that's kind of irrelevant because we're not here for these girls right now we're coming over here to look at the new clones not so new anymore and i can no longer neglect them because they're kind of growing like weeds how thick that is holy cow all right so what i was going to do was top them all see here look at that mutation it's called a mutant see last time i was in here i'm not even sure that's a word but mutation is and you can clearly see it there but uh that'll be a nice easy top so i was going to top them all again that would be a nice easy top if you can see right there kazow and this one not quite so easy uh that one's fine too i could get that one too easy all right jesus i got the shakes i'm not exactly sure about that one either i think about it what i might do since we got one outlier here so i think what i'll do just at this moment since these three look at this guy whoo these three are all basically the same i'm gonna clip this guy i gotta get in here and do something about these girls they're kind of getting pretty tall already i've got the light probably at 40 inches or something or 48 inches so i i better bring that in some more and do something about these plants but look at this this is something else that's common with this mutation are these three fingered leaves wild so you got plenty that are five like there's another three that's a three three crazy crazy so i'm gonna clip this here we go let's top this so this one will be very very easy because we got a nice long neck there for her to clip just go right in there and snip there we go so hopefully that'll arrest the development here for this girl a little bit [Music] and i'm not exactly sure that's what i wanted to do the left one there oh yeah so that's my what am i doing i'm looking at this guy we're right here i better uh speed this up before these edibles kick in so and perhaps they already have all right so i actually did do it fine here's here's my two girls so these will take over but that should have rested it should slow it down for a little bit maybe these girls will catch up a little bit these ones here will probably pop up a little bit and then at that point this one here is the troublemaker i can't really clearly get in there and and what i can't do is see the sprout that i'm going to be leaving i can't see it on this one side yet so i'll give that a couple days i mean i kind of can but if i give it a day or two that'll pop up and i can just clip it easy so i'll do those three in a couple days so let's see if that works so we'll see if that sort of stops this growth a little bit uh and get these going and then i got to do something in this i gotta i'll have to put in the second light because there's only one light in here right now and arrange the 10 properly obviously i have yet to do that um and that has to happen because it's time so that's it for uh this but we'll be back in a day or two with some action on these two girls but that's it for now go pro stop recording so day 41 and i have made a discovery and it's not a good one let's go in for a closer look see if the gopro catch it if you look down here i don't know where good spots are maybe right here and see what kind of looks like a whitish gray smudge but that is in fact powdery mildew and you can maybe see it speckled on the leaves around there down there there's some speckling kind of all around and yet there's little to none on any of the top leaves so that's a good sign but that's not a good sign generally overall so we're going to attack it right now in two ways one hello one we are going to clip the leaves that just really don't need to be here so it's a lot of these under leaves here and they really aren't serving much purpose they don't really need to be there so i'll clip some them not a ton but some of them are just obviously that have a bit of mildew on them and can just really go without having any effect whatsoever and then after that anything that i don't really want to clip like if it happens to be on a sugar leaf or something i'm going to take a wipe of uh like 10 hydrogen peroxide with just a cloth and i'm going to wipe the leaves and we're going to see how that works so that's that i'm going to get to work gopro stop recording greetings fellow humans it's suburban herb here welcome back to my little world it's day 44 of flower and look at these beauties they're a little uh saggy but uh they're doing fine so day 44 that means we're two days into week seven so what does that mean uh not much going on really that means so i'm looking at about a 10-day 10-day flush so i'm gonna start that flush in two or three days kind of thing looking to presumably be harvesting in 14 ish days and yeah so we might be around that mark so what i'm gonna do so like we're two days into week seven i'm going to look at some trichomes all right now all right let's look at some trichomes because girls look fairly mature for just having finished their uh sixth week effectively so let's take a look see this is calibrating properly not bad not bad i see some amber there it's a little bit tricky to do while also holding the phone but it is doable so i see a lot of cloudy i'll look uh look at them closer later but just glancing at them as i try to focus on the picture see where can we go here so what i try to do is that while actually you can focus these on the go but i find it pretty difficult to hold it steady as i'm focusing so what i'll do is i'll set the focal point right right at the top like right on that edge uh and then basically just sit that on a sugar leaf effectively and then just kind of slide it in or move it over so basically i don't really maul the bud too much and i get a fairly steady picture because i'm i'm laying the microscope right on laying it against the bud so these look all right crystally full show they're all sagging uh yeah look at that so looks like oh the attention here looks like we're predominantly cloudy what are you doing predominantly cloudy and actually a little bit of amber possibly more than i would expect to see uh just giving the history my history with this plant that's probably enough to get half a dozen they all kind of look the same i think basically to me mostly cloudy a tiny little bit of amber probably a little bit of clear thrown in there so you know just judging from that again i'll take a better look later but looking at that we might be right on time for basically an eight-week harvester right around there i would guess just judging from the looks of those but that's just uh just kind of an eyeball eyeball test we'll just watch the amber trichomes as they appear and uh once they get to a level that will we are comfortable with often shooting for you know that mystical magical 10 kind of thing but that's kind of what i look for and uh yeah we're not there yet but we got a little amber so so far so good day 44 and uh yeah it's just to explain the lopsidedness of everything i actually shifted my little stands down here i think the gopro's doing well in the dark there anyway i moved some things down here uh which actually shifted things all around so it got a little bit messy i'm not too worried about i kind of like it actually i don't mind when these lay over i don't know if it's bad for them i don't know if it confuses them or what but uh it kind of opens up the lower buds pretty well um yeah i'm not worried about it we're doing fine so these girls are good day 44 will start him on water in a few days that's it for the update here let's go next door to the 4x4 blitz may we come in he loves it under the lights mars hydro tsl 2000 singular rocking these four plants i gotta get the second one up soon because it's time to to set these girls up because uh i won't say again that i've been ignoring them but i'm gonna ignore on them uh so the only thing i've done i believe i guess it's earlier in this video but it was a few days ago as i topped this one to let these other ones catch up whether that's working or not still remains to be seen uh and after that the only other thing i'll do there's a there's a few little gizmos down here i could get rid of those little guys don't bother doing that right now this is something i'm giving to someone else and they've yet to pick up and there we go so they look fine again with their funny little mutations but who cares not me currently and once again i'll promise to set this tent up soon properly instead of just having them lined up here under this one light but it does leave plenty room for my dog to bask in the warmth of the leds but they're doing fine they're kind of getting pretty tall i should really start doing something with them my goodness gracious yeah soon soon but i love these three fingered leaves yeah nothing wrong with this guy girl she's perfectly normal three fingers everywhere it's all right because presumably and hopefully they'll bud just like their mothers did like this which um i am not mad at all they look good they look very much like they did my last grow and that really turned out really really well uh smoke ability and yields pretty good too but just in in regards to yield in this respect just the buds were dense and base almost all of them were reusable right down to like you start looking at the buds down here and at least some girls in the past um you know those buds they those buds have all kinds of trichomes but uh there's no density of the buds but these babies i don't know they're just so dense with trichomes and they just get even down here that little beauty i guarantee you is very firm i can't really even squeeze it delicious yeah they smell beautiful so we're within a couple weeks uh to harvest so that's beautifully exciting and while we're here this is my first full grow under these myrus hydro sb250s and i had a tiny bit of concern considering there are only 230 watts apiece more on that later but as compared to my tsl 2000s next door which are 300 watts piece and uh you know i don't know if i don't you know there's not a noticeable difference these look like big fat beautiful buds as well so so they both seem to do the job and do it quite well seemingly look at those look at the frost oh does the gopro pick up the frost look at that guy there i don't know why he just looks so super duper frosty but they're all frosty it's beautiful all right my friends that's it day 44. we'll be back in uh you know a few days and see what's up that's it for now go pro stop recording", "oV9s-4tnlqc": "[Music] [Music]

it's pouring outside you can tell i don't know where you guys are before it gets porn right now so i did a little ride up north and [ __ ] messed up and i [ __ ] crossed state lines which actually kendall cakes it's literally like right over the state line it's [ __ ] right by my house it's not that far it's [ __ ] 45 minutes right up the road no big deal um don't do anything too drastic don't worry i wouldn't contaminate anybody but uh i want to get some flour because running a lot of flour not that i couldn't get in connecticut it's truly not a big deal at all i just wanted to [ __ ] go up to north because i had a down day and i wanted to seize my down day i was like nervous no don't can't pass up any down day so i'm up to theory as you can see i'm gonna grab some of their gorilla glue excited about that because it's just a straight gg4 gorilla glue number four the original grilling glue yay locking the couch sit there and [ __ ] get medicated out in connecticut we've only had the gorilla glue come across the menu a few times and it's kind of a rarity i love gorilla glue it's a [ __ ] fantastic strain and i'm really excited to see how their batch roller glue is so let's check it out i looked and i grabbed a quarter so this bag feels heavy as [ __ ] so the other one on set up there's since the code thing there's a 10 outside you have to order ahead of time has to be all pre-ordered just like in connecticut you go and you check out cash or credit whatever they give you a little you check your id you get a receipt you have to walk to another window on the side it won't really serve you like 80s style [ __ ] you know i'm saying back in the day which is actually pretty cool um so this is all ready to go it feels heavy as [ __ ] so this is definitely not just a quarter it's either in a big container or they [ __ ] up again they can mount so either way that might be cool let's find out granted it's a little more expensive for wheat out there a lot more expensive food out there this quarter ounce cost me a buck 30. here's what it is when i plant it all now right so what you get is actually inside here is this other big ass container which is actually really nice um this is a nice container check it out big theory wellness flower container which is around this thing seven grams which is pretty nice alright so here i'll just do a quick sniff test then we'll check this out but here on the top it says the package date um apparently the package is the night four days currently it's like six this has been packaged sitting there for about five days no big deal that's how they gotta do this [ __ ] nowadays but this is the gorilla glue and i'm really excited about this word check the show nice i'm not disappointed at all when i open this container oh that's gorilla glue all day long [ __ ] oh this one's potent as [ __ ] and this is about 20 20 thc i'm glad i made this run i'm real happy right now oh yeah that's nice this container is full that's a nice container too you can reuse this [ __ ] like i had a little black hair i was gonna put my [ __ ] quarter in and i honestly just don't have to look it so now you can see what i see i opened it up and boom right off the top nice size buds cakey as you can see looks good so now let's dump this out here this [ __ ] stinks stinks like a real potent batch of gorilla glue i like the fact that the buds are bigger they're actually fitting out the top here i feel like they're really the [ __ ] pack this thing fall nice very happy with this so if you guys are wondering like [ __ ] man i wonder if these pre-orders are gonna be how the flower's gonna be from that gregory it gets better don't worry there's more look at that big bowl nice yeah they ain't [ __ ] around they [ __ ] around at all these [ __ ] are big ass buds big nice crusty huge gorilla glow [ __ ] monsters this is [ __ ] nice look at this whole quarter there's a nice quarter big bud big bud big bud big bud

like theory we do small batch canvas and they seem to really take pride in their marijuana oh i'm [ __ ] psyched right now i'm really really happy this [ __ ] looks like fire fire nice and anybody's over 21 you drive right to their ones right now and get the exact same marijuana so it's still a menu look at that [ __ ] wow that's pretty [ __ ] potent looking and not only is this a really potent looking marijuana this is [ __ ] gorilla glue so i'm [ __ ] psyched as [ __ ] all right so i always go with the smaller [ __ ] so i'm gonna take the smaller [ __ ] this and this that's probably more than two balls um try to make that work maybe a little bit extra wow there's notifications this session and uh yeah let's make my rainy day go away for sure you know what i'm saying all right so yeah like what the [ __ ] that's what the [ __ ] i mean i guess you're wondering where to find out it's nice these containers are nice i mean really nice this bud is fresh soft sticky oh yeah it's [ __ ]

can be between i'd say 28 and 32 depending on how good the grower is and i'm about to smoke some of this in front of you and tell you how it makes me feel i've smoked it for years so i know exactly how it makes me feel but i'll let you know and you'll see the effects get my bowl out here just going to use a small pipe uh for one thing about regular number four we're in indica really packs quite a head high uh the body buzz is above any other you're gonna get it's almost like a narcotic stone or a narcotic high that's why it's really good to help me get off opiates it helps me with my chronic pain which helped me get off opiates it helps me with ptsd chronic depression anxiety insomnia uh it helps me with a tremendous amount of things uh helps with my neuropathy helps with my arthritis uh not too much cbd in it you might want to take a cbd supplement like a water soluble cbd like i do go to www.godgreenearthcbd.com order their products they're great they're out of breckenridge michigan you'll love them all right now i'm gonna smoke some gg4 now didn't get a real good toke there i filled the bowl a little too full oh yeah you get yeah makes me cough because it's super super sour excuse me super sour super gassy uh maybe a little citrus note to it uh definitely earthy spicy all those wonderful you can tell it comes from i think it comes from ken's sister and some other funky gassy strains and it's just wonderful almost time to clean my pipe wow uh yeah the head rush is uh the head rash is really good for the creative process it really uh unfocuses your mind to the point where you are open to new ideas uh the bodybuilds like i said it just evaporates the pain it just melts it away slowly as every toke it's absolutely wonderful now i light it every time not everybody does that i'm going through a lot of lighters but hey what can i say i like to feel that burn wow and to go with that i think i'm going to put my friend gave me a little piece of gg4 hash i think i'm gonna put a little tiny rice type piece of that sticky stuff on it and then i will be off into the stratosphere all right here we go putting a little in the pine oh shoot and now we're no now we're headed to happy land got the hash in the pipe just a little he gave me quite a bit gt4 hash is wonderful if you want that extra kick to sprinkle a little on the top of your bowl and smoke it yeah and the hash is that little added extra the gt4 hash just uh puts you in a really good place just wow you can see it'll have you talking kind of funny for a while i'm sorry folks oh wow my friend made some really good hash that's all i gotta say wow try that if you can because that'll that'll make your night well worth well worth it oh wow yeah uh that's making me feel really good i have no pain i

but wow that's just incredible uh and get your party started that's for sure and take away any opiate cravings uh at least lessen them a great deal because it's close to an actual hard narcotic you're going to find in a cannabis strain in gg4 uh people that used to self-medicate with ops this is almost like a self-medication to get you off opiates uh it's wonderful and i'm getting really high and

have i seen this before it's not like this is an obvious attempt at making a quick buck off of tick tock right alright ladies and gentlemen it's me shifo here once again now this video is not going to be just another that gorilla glue girl video because i know you're probably tired of seeing videos about that creature over and over again but apparently her actions have inspired a lot of idiots on tick tock to start putting gorilla glue on their hair for clout and it's bad like this is actually really bad so i'm about to take a shower guys please help me please help me i don't know what to do um this was an accident i didn't mean to put gorilla glue in my hair guys it was an accident i didn't mean to put gorilla glue in my hair shut the [ __ ] up all right like no no anybody was like half a brain cell can easily tell that the only reason that you're doing this is for tech talk cloud also you are so incredibly uncreative that you're literally copying the exact same strategy that someone else used to get famous on tick tock you guys my hair will not comb oh no oh no your hair won't comb when there's gorilla glue on it oh no who could have thought that could possibly happen but anyways what am i supposed to do what do i what i do do i go to the hospital or do i seek medical help nah let me first make a tick talk about it just to show the whole world how incredibly stupid i am first i'm on my way to the hospital right now my scalp is burning i need to go to the hospital so they can remove this gorilla glue i have no idea what to do i try washing it it doesn't come off um yeah i need to go to the hospital i'm on my way to hospital right now um so go to the freaking hospital and stop making tick tocks like how hard is it to put down the phone and actually focus on your health like i have seen cloud chasing all right like it's nothing new to me but you are so damn bad for tick tock cloud that you are literally out here pioneering a whole new level of cloud chasing i'm going to the hospital right now i'm on my way to the emergency room guys i'm freaking out oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god guys i'm really freaking out right now now please feel sorry for me and follow me on tech talk inside the hospital and i'm waiting for one of the nurses to come they don't really know what to do they're they're confused they don't know my scalp is burning so why are people actually watching this [ __ ] like seriously this is so boring and uninteresting on so many levels i don't know how to say it like how the [ __ ] did this get 2.1 million views like why are people like this like why does tik tok seem to reward stupid behavior like this so i just got out the hospital and they did nothing for me look at my hair this is what they told me to do you should apply either olive oil tea tree oil or coconut oil on your hair to attempt to remove the glue honestly at this point like you might as well just shave your whole head off because trust me that's really gonna get you a lot more views than you can expect like you know that's the best way to get even more cloud than what you're already getting right now so update on the gorilla glue it did not come out i use coconut oil for like half an hour and then i um just wash my hair and there's still gorilla glue in my head guess i gotta go bald yes please go bald like you know please please please hey guys so i didn't want to do this video but i'm thinking about starting a gofundme page hey guys i didn't want to actually put gorilla glue on my hair but then i accidentally did it and i also didn't want to start to go for me but then you know i also accidentally did it like you know like guys i really didn't mean to make any of this like this is 100 coincidental and i'm absolutely 100 not try to milk the [ __ ] out of a current trendy situation by completely making a clown of myself on the internet okay guys so i'm gonna try and do my hair i'm using the leave-in conditioner by shea moisture see what i can do put some leave-in conditioner on my hair what the hell is she doing like what does she even try to do here like at this point i don't

enough fun to get surgery and i will be flying out to la what does flying out to la have anything to do with you getting surgery like can you not just get surgery in your hometown or did you really have to flex the fact that you were able to get enough idiots on gofundme to give you a lot of money for you to fly out to la like you literally put gorilla glue on your hair like there's absolutely nothing to flex about here yeah i don't know about you guys but i don't feel like this is the hospital you know like this looks awfully similar to how a normal house would look like this is definitely not the hospital like yeah she lied she didn't go to the hospital she didn't get surgery like that's definitely 100 her mom no that is her mom that's her mom right there doing her hair for her like all of this was actually a lie like all of this was just one massive lie but then again she's a tick talker so her whole life is pretty much a lie hey guys what's up i just wanted to come on here

notifications i'm gonna be really sad and my channel will not grow and i don't know that that seems a little bit depressing but anyways uh yeah this is me shifo and i will see you guys again very soon see [Music]", "dB4FM6TmA9Y": "so i'm definitely not an idiot and i didn't delete the permanent invite for the discord server uh yeah i made a new invite and basically revamped the entire discord so if you want to join that then the link will be in the description and on the screen but anyways yo what's up so today we're going to be talking about that one girl that put gorilla glue in her hair as some kind of hair product yeah i know she has a very high iq you could probably already tell that by the size of her forehead i don't know what type of braid she's got in there but she is packing anyways tessica brown is a girl that decided that she would put gorilla glue in her hair thinking that it would just replace her normal hair product because she didn't have any left which then of course caused her hair to stick and flattened to her head you made a video on it and actually showed what it's like when your hair is completely stuck to your head so yeah i'll let that one play hey y'all for those of y'all that know me know my hair has been like this for about a month now it's not my choice no it's not a choice when i do my hair i like to you know finish it off with a little got to be glue spray you know just to keep it in place well i didn't have any more got to be glue space so i used this gorilla glue spray bad bad bad idea yo look my hair it don't move you hear what i'm telling you it don't move i've washed my hair 15 times and it don't move stiff got to be glue spray don't ever ever use this looks harder than my dick at four o'clock in the morning she got surgery to get her hair removed and i can't lie it's pretty bad so with that being said grab your shampoo and hope that it's not glue i hope you enjoy so straight after she blew up from this apparently beyonce got in contact with her and asked her if she wanted beyonce's hair specialist to help her get the glue out of her hair which i can't lie right it's pretty sick if it wasn't for the fact that it didn't even [ __ ] work and keep in mind she had her hair like that for a full-on month if not two actually before she had a surgeon help actually get the gorilla glue out of her hair and after she got it out her hair was obviously a lot shorter and it's kind of [ __ ] obvious but the brand of gorilla glue themselves weren't exactly very happy with this video because it kind of shone a bad light on them which you know i can completely understand there were a lot of people that were calling tesco an idiot and there were a lot of people calling gorilla glue you know the brand itself an idiot because they didn't make it specific enough that you shouldn't put it in your hair and i'm not gonna lie right if the brand itself is literally made of making one of the strongest super glues on the planet why would you think of putting it in your hair like you've got to be brain dead the gorilla glue twitter account tweeted out we are aware of the situation and we are very sorry to hear about the unfortunate incident that miss brown experienced using our spray adhesive on her hair this is a unique situation because this product is not indicated for use in or on hair as it is considered permanent our spray adhesive states in the warning label do not swallow do not get in eyes skin or clothing it is used to craft home auto or office projects to mount things to surf for i can't [ __ ] read today such as paper cardboard wood laminate and fabric we are glad to see in her recent video that miss brown has received medical treatment from her local medical facility and wish her the best i i swear i'm gonna fail my english gcse at this point i cannot read people like genuinely mad at gorilla glue here and they're saying that apparently a lot of other people have used it in their hair and the testing around is within full right to be able to sue them now i'm not gonna lie right maybe i'm the one that's going insane here and i'm the one that's just choosing the wrong side but i don't think that you should be able to suit a company because you decided to put glue in your hair i mean holy [ __ ] if you're that [ __ ] stupid then maybe you deserve to have the gorilla glue in your hair in the first place if i see a box of nesquik chocolate milk powder i'm not going to put that in my hair just because it's the same color as almond shampoo unless i like wanted chocolatey hair for some reason which i don't i just want to put that out there persona brown started a gofundme which raised over 13 000 you you are taking the piss here don't get me wrong i can understand that she was most definitely in pain and that her getting the gorilla glue out of her hair it's definitely a good thing but you can't really say that it was anyone else's fault apart from herself like one there are a bunch of tweets from other accounts verified accounts might i add nbcl i have no [ __ ] idea what that is i think it's some kind of like news corporation are now trying to involve race with this talking about black beauty standards as if that has [ __ ] to do with it like she put gorilla glue in her hair what what the [ __ ] does race have to do with i don't get it if you run out of hair product you're not gonna put a [ __ ] ham sandwich in your hair are you i mean maybe there are people out there that would but i am definitely not one of them but there you go there's pretty much the jessica brown story now don't get me wrong i'm very happy to hear that she's got the gorilla glue out of her hair and that she's doing a lot better now i think to conclude this video all i really have to say is please please don't put gorilla glue in your hair or anything that isn't hair product it's just not worth it now if you watch this video and thought i was a little bit funny or just [ __ ] i don't know enjoyed it then make sure to go ahead and leave a like and subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications i try to upload videos every single day i'm going to try and upload as

train wreck for one it's really good actually it's pretty stony it's kind of smooth you know not bad yeah I like it really sativa for for me pretty ball very fire good stuff then I also got some glue I really enjoyed the gorilla glue strained this is a indoor it's uh from my buddy who I got those uh really good friend of mine got those babies from you yeah this is really good really fires your typical grill do I think it's just like the GG for super like Louie fuelie heavy Stoney stuff I like it this bomber so this for the daytime mornings for me works out just great and afternoons are midday this does fire oh yeah just figure that you have a check up right peace", "kQD7QylfH9E": "good morning New Testament growers all over the world yes we are back at the crack garden all righty so we are at we are in 4x4 growth sent with the 4G g-force gorilla glue number four by far my favorite to grow under the new testaments growers way to grow and she's at day 20 and flower she is done stretching for the plants on the left side they're about five feet tall that's from the bottom of the stalk up that's not including the pot or the the trays or anything but the ones to the right they are about four and a half feet tall and again they don't get as tall as the side on the left because the fan is kind of putting a work on them so but we do benefit from that as you know we get the free super crops and stuff like that on some of them see that knuckle is farmed from the fan pressing down on them when the branches were soft but uh yeah she is done stretching and she is a gonna just pack on the weight from here on out she still is only going to be given the meals and be nutrient every other day some days we might give her a little more but uh yeah we're only giving her five MLS per gallon also so we're not up into among the amounts we're just gonna keep it very minimal you know keep it down as much as possible we don't like those you know the heavy flushing that needs to be done and stuff like that because as you all know we finish up quick we uh we harvest a lot faster our process is usually snow more to 70 days sixty-five but uh as you all know the animal cookies that we're if you're following us they're gonna go 75 and you know it was because of power outages and stuff like that but the gorilla glues are there done stretching they're just gonna be putting on weight from here on out and uh you know for anybody who's knew these ladies came straight from cups August 5th 2019 and they were cloned straight from cups this plant has only been with me 39 days she was five six inches oh she was a five or six inch cone and a cup when I received her if you're viewing this on the week - you couldn't follow me on youtube also and I have videos where I transplanted her when the first day that I transplanted her from cups it was August 5th 2019 and she was just a small little plant she's 39 days oh she's 20 days and flower we've edged her 19 days we also have that video when we switched her to 1212 cycle that was August 24 2009 teen so the way we grow you do not spend a lot of money you speed up your growth time and you pull off very very great harvesters and I mean as a grower we all would love to be able to keep our myths flowing for us a lot quicker when I first started growing I was so not feeling going for months I was so not filling 14 and 21 days of flushing so you know I had to think outside the box when it came to this and I wasn't afraid to take risks I definitely I'm growing away that a lot of we'll say don't do I'm growing away that a lot of growers are afraid to do but yeah I learned this way and I'm sticking with it as long as I could keep pulling off these results with multiple strands I've ran several strands under these conditions the high heat high humidity that we run under and the plants love it you know I will admit a couple of oh geez I ran didn't care for it kay Shoji was one of them and the catfish was one of them it did not they didn't like it they did finish but they foxtail the whole time I mean I'm sure I can run them again I just won't grow them up to the light but as you see we like to we definitely like to get up close as we can to that like the East plants the ones to the left I should say are probably about 6 7 inches from the light and that light is just gonna make those ladies chunk up pretty good you know I'm gonna be in here doing some work throughout the stages of her putting on her weight because this Gorilla Glue she has like the linky branches we don't super crop we don't we don't do no extra cutting on our plants we just let them go and we switch them you know we don't we don't do no snow stress training no none of that we just tie them up you know and you'll see follow this video you'll see how beautiful she looks you know I'm sure a lot of the followers are waiting to see the eight animal cookies as they're scheduled to to come out on the 25th of September this month and that what I'm gonna actually shoot a pay-for a video when I harvest her so you're gonna get some really nice pictures of the animal cookies some good close-ups and stuff like that so it should be fun to watch it should be you know I'm very excited she's looking so good she's starting a purple as well so the ice is working with her also but I'm yeah this is the the gorilla glue we're at day 20 she is done stretching she will just be putting on her weight from here on out and she's probably only gonna go 45 days and flowers so this harvest is only gonna be about sixty four days total you know if I go fifty you know it depends but she usually starts to yellow her leaves usually starts to yellow she uses she finishes up and again we pull when the the try calls are cloudy we don't some of them will be amber but the majority of them will be cloudy it'll be the highest level of THC she'll be super frosty I've ran her several times I absolutely love the runner so I'd know just about what she's gonna do and how she's gonna look she's gonna be finished I believe I'm gonna do a pay video for her as well when she finished just to show you all how beautiful she is but again if you're trying to speed up your growth time keep good results you know keep down any type of mites or anything and you know follow the channel and you can learn some things here we've been doing this this way a long time so we're pretty confident and your results we're pretty confident on what you're gonna get yield wise and things like that you're not gonna spend a lot of money this setup does not cost a lot it doesn't consist of much I mean it can make a person who's afraid of growing thinking that it's the hardest thing to do I mean it can it can change your whole mind you know and it can it's definitely going to reward you in the end when it comes to the quality of smoke that you're gonna have for the time that you've spent and the money that you spent again subscribe to the

peace", "q8yXmg_G3oo": "[Music] is [Music] she's got a few more days yet to go just tell she's got just a little bit too much moisture so she will be going for a few more days on this dry she's looking beautiful though beautiful jump", "IcjfKFgbGG0": "hello everyone welcome to another video you ain't even gonna believe your eyes i just can't believe this to be honest i do feel a little bad for this woman but then again isn't your brain meant to say hold up wait a minute sorry clearly not though sometimes the thought of things should stay as thoughts and this is an example hey y'all for those of y'all that know me know my hair has been like this for about a month now it's not bad choice no it's not a choice when i do my hair i like to you know finish it off with a little got to be glue spray you know just to keep it in place well i didn't have any more got to be glue space so i use this gorilla glue bad idea i can't believe you've done this gorilla glue you know that stuff is strong in fact it's one of the most strongest super glues on the market damn now that's hardcore i may or may not have stuck my hands together with it in the past i ain't even gonna give an explanation on that though i don't know why you don't just order some normal hair glue need a little patience another day or two out your life he's not going to hurt you is it this is it's better than this solution here let me tell you i'll take that for free however she did this because there's a thing called gorilla snot gel yeah you had me correctly snot what the [ __ ] how do people come up with these names i need to know that sounds like the most unappealing thing i've ever seen but yes this woman had a brainwave thinking these two were similar i feel like taking my head off and kicking it why in the heavens did she not just google it you're tick-tock surely you have access to google you know i thought everyone googles things before doing them or is that just me i think i need to live a little sometimes if you look at the bottle of the gorilla glue it states it bonds wood stone metal ceramic foam glass and more damn that bottle's really selling it to me i don't think dead cells aka hair if you didn't know it's comparable to those things but okay because she did it anyway get ready for the decline yo look my hair it don't move you hear what i'm telling you it don't move yeah no that's because your hair is now one with your head congratulations where is your new hair gonna grow inside your brain probably because you know what you've caused blockage you've bonded your hair to your head it's stuck now it's stuck now the procedure is heavy to get that off you know i'm painful trust me but hey at least the wind ain't gonna be an issue no more so it makes it all worth it right i've washed my hair 15 times and it don't move stiff wear whoa my hair so i'm gonna tell y'all like this if you ever ever run out of got to be glue spray don't ever ever use this well i'm sure we can all learn something from this i mean don't use gorilla glue on your hair i mean i think we all knew that to be honest i feel like this is a joke man i honestly can't wrap my head around it i'm gonna have to take the l and shave that off i don't think there's another way you gotta start again if you can that is i don't know if you can shave glue i don't think so can you shave glue four that's a toughie never done it i mean i've never had the urge to put super glue on my head mate you know what i think should pull it off being bold that shit's hot not gonna lie i would if my head didn't resemble a potato what can you do just might have something to do with the fact i was plunged out the womb plunge dude [ __ ] wag one mother anywho she continues the uh tick tock series showing the population that what she was saying was true what what look look yo look look you wipe it off and nothing happens like this is the life that i'm living at this moment like this is the life that i guess i'm have to live i just want to give her a hug and tell her everything's okay even though it's not it's not is it no i've never seen one shampoo their hair like that and wipe it off with a flannel that's pretty impressive i wish i could do that life would be so easy so you know how shampoo is used to clean your hair well with this chick it's a polish mate the hair ain't hair no more your head has consumed it now shampoo isn't the strongest thing in the world it's not going to remove superglue it's pretty darn it because you know its main purpose is to uh clean hair not for hair mixed with glue that is meant to bloody bond stone with stone i've messed up my hair over the years i know the struggle it's real trust me a most of us have come on you look back and laugh though you do eventually it is what it is take life on the chin could have been worse make this a lesson yeah don't go around dishing uh gorilla glue on your hair it's not a good idea i gotta be the one to tell you that at least it's easy to keep that head hair glue clean though super fair super quick usain bolt of hair this one now forever i think nail varnish remover does help with this you just got to be careful with it being on your head and all you can't exactly scrub no i mean it's most likely going to damage your hair in the process but that's just the price you've got to pay for the moment of stupidity again we've all been there just not with super glue though some of us this was the moment i thought i'ma try this cut a piece of hair didn't realize it was up so much hair not gonna lie that wasn't part of the plan even though i put gloves on here i still managed to get it on my hands after hours trying to unharden this dumb thing that's been in the drawer for ages i had to stab stab stub i got a bit though bit gunjer but it works applied on the hair waited five men i was getting more [ __ ] stuck to everything oh and what do you know destroyed my poor hair what the [ __ ] was i doing here oh well i hope it was worth it i'm just gonna take this at the cardboard box right now i think it's safe to say she's not gonna get her hair back if that destroyed my air in five minutes what's a month saying anyway gorilla glue officially responded to this oh damn now you know it's serious let's have a look at it here's some rubbing alcohol water in a spray bottle a hair dryer and a comb but since you've had it like that for a month your hair could be damaged no [ __ ] it's going to take some time to come off so it's been there for a month oh damn this is serious forgot this chick left it in for a month how did you leave it in for a month what ah this just gets worse don't it why didn't she hack sooner why is the sky blow honestly hope she manages to sort it out look like she's gonna have to shave the old thing if she can shave it oh bless her man this is actually so sad i think it's so safe she won't be messing with the gorilla glow again don't underestimate the power sun you underestimate my power don't try it it'll get you it will anyway guys i keep watching this video please take care i'll see you in the next one you", "xOOLU7IZA4g": "you know how is someone doing today diving down here back with another video in this video you can tell when a different setting we're outside it's because I'm going to be doing a weed strain review and in this strange is gonna be doing the original Gorilla Glue actually we're doing like a really good number for us I'm not the original there it is I also have three point five an eighth of this gorilla glue number four yesterday I went on a little 4/20 shopping spree at the shop we got Kelly carts video or the video after this one this is the c21 cartridge Northern Lights I have two hot films so yeah there's that I don't know which one I'm a review first several one comes up first let's get it man this is the gorilla glue number four I'll show you guys like a little I don't have that much of it guys see it that's the original gorilla glue head let me open up the gorilla glue number or the original guys stop firing man straight fire sticky it is really glue original sounds good man we got our little rig here which I found a bull piece so I just put that on here so I thought I switch it up and do a weed review instead of a cartridge review even other country reviews will still be coming as you can see I got this so it's gonna man this is the gorilla glue number for sure you guys have a good angle on seeing it and Cheers [Music] so blue is the indica dominant hybrid if you guys don't know it's instantaneous train it's always my go-to strain when I go to the shop I always get gorilla glue I don't know why oh wow so after that first hit that tasted pretty good the taste was strong I didn't really hit me that hard maybe I didn't take a fat not fit so here we go that one hit me it's a gorilla Lu this has like a piney taste to it that's all I can really say just a piney we taste there's nothing fruity about it there's no special taste about it you know it's just gorilla glue number four so yeah this is simple simple straight nothing nothing fancy he's gosh hey this is my rig and I just threw on the ball piece Ashley [ __ ] it now I'm getting that feeling of can't opening my eyes would you take a Fathead sometimes your eyes just stay closed and that's what I'm going through right now so yeah this is a review on that that's the glitter glue number four it's out of the ten I'll probably give it compared to grizzly number four you know this kill this ball [ __ ] it let's just kill this more and I came to look compared to the grill number four I mean the original this is dank part man this is very very crystally and very squishy and that snugs holy five it's strong it's very strong as you can tell so happy for 22 guys celibate for 20 which probably most of you it's for 21 right now but like I might as well throw that in there so look for it Kalle current reviews look forward to see 21 cartridge reviews and look forward to the original relic will reveal this one with the gorilla glue number four and I hope you guys enjoyed it if you did leave a like if you're new subscribe I'm out peace", "YiNoSWfisGo": "yeah this is from my recent harvest it's gorilla glue number four great genetics i got the clone from archive in portland oregon they're pretty renowned uh in their clones it's great it's great tasting smells good looks good the buzz is there i currently have forum girl scout cookies going right now from them as well you", "uEIKFMlxKb0": "right [ __ ] what it says on the tin let's actually look at the contents of the tin [Music] probably due to its 50 50. percent sativa and hybrid what am i talking about what am i talking about i can't do reviews i can't do reviews i need i need to have some time to think hello and welcome to look at the wrong way [ __ ] sake start again look that way not there because that's not looking at your eyes and it's disrespectful to my viewers look there right in their eyes start again hello and welcome to another episode of strangers my name is rizzler and this is a wee viewer of raw view weed view raw raise the raw i don't know anyway it's me on my phone taking the easy option not much editing not much production just on the mobile phone and making sure we do some reviews because i've got a bit of a back catalog people are sending me stuff to review and i haven't reviewed it yet but time's ticking and also i'm smoking the strains so we've got hurry up before there's no weed left to review that wouldn't be too good would it no it wouldn't be good at all so what is on today's episode you've probably seen it a few times now but yes cherry gorilla now look at this peeps it's in one of these packets that means the weeds better obviously isn't it that just automatically means weeds better when it's all done nicely there's my posing okay i love posing uh let's get it out let's talk about subscribing because if you haven't subscribed to strain games before then how dare you no it might be your first time there if it is your first time here make sure you hit the sub button hit the like button just assume it's going to be a good video like it already and comment and what else is there share as well yeah make sure you share it sharon's carrying people and i'll be most grateful if you could share this link to other people maybe other stoners out there that haven't seen this before maybe stoners out there that have smoked this string before or maybe people that are not stoners and you're going to send it to them anyway i i don't care either way share that video now enough of this cherry gorilla this is by baraleo i think i've got the pronunciation right parallel and it's got the information on here as well which is always good saves me working out what i'm smoking saves me pressing uh cherry gritter on google what what is this strain i'm going to smell it a few times because it is dank now four things to cover when we do the reviews and we view is where we're looking at the uk strains going around at the moment and this is landed in my hand just like that i wish it was imagine if it just raining bud god please make it rainbow one day come on 2020 has been a bit of a [ __ ] and i think the least you can do is make up by having rain of weed please just eating bud might as well like what am i talking about it's a raw it's a raw audition people which means you're gonna get all this crap i don't cut this stuff out you're getting it all unfortunately i'm sorry about that so yeah four things to cover we're looking at the site we're looking at the smell we're looking at the taste and also we're looking at the effects and someone else my dentists are calling me up oh [ __ ] say what do they want sorry about that but actually was my dentist and uh my teeth are [ __ ] thanks for rona virus i'm blaming you china uh anyway yeah it's now got even less time to do the review because now they're just called up to say we can fit you in before i was had to maybe about a month i have to wait to get my teeth sorted uh but now they've had a cancellation and i get it sorted today which means i've only got a few more minutes to do this review which means stop chatting crap let's get straight down to the point let's cover these four things as i said sight uh i was gonna say sound then never say sound sight smell taste and effect we were scoring these out of 10 so the top score will be 40 and nothing's come close to 40. i think the highest right now strain table right there it's about 35 35 and a half i can't remember but it's there for you where will this hit where will cherry gorilla hit before we even look at the categories we have to do a bit of background knowledge a bit of info for you how did this cherry gorilla come about who was his mummy who was its daddy who invented it who smoked it let's find out it's the history so after a little bit of research in-house genetics apparently famous for their micro breeding and crossing of famous strains and also exclusive strains so this is probably a fine example of crossing the cherry uh black cherry with gorilla glue that's all i could find uh also the percentage is actually not as high as probably one would think about 17 between 16 to 18 thc around about 17 average on this one let's have a little close-up look of the cherry gorilla so i always like it when you've got the information right in front of you and this is a lot of information on there so cherry gorilla 3.5 well it used to be 3.5 until uh yeah i started to smoke it uh contains thc [ __ ] good job if you didn't have thc and i brought my money back not safe for kids or pets duh cherry gorilla is a hybrid kind of a strain well balanced in its effects uh gorilla glue fans get their taste for a generic so mix a genetic mix of gorilla glue 4 and black cherry pie breeders this is in-house genetics and gg4 cross bcp look at that just all properly done for us or even harvest on the 12th of july of 2020. anyone got bags like this they tell you when they're harvest because that's the first time i've ever seen that nice little touch and this is a uh love the uh artwork as well really nice artwork also a 50 50 hybrid that's right straight from the middle no mucking around 50 sativa 50 percent couch bong and grinnell 4 is famous for its couch lock so then got half couch lock here and then half is the non catch lock again tells me what it's good for when it comes to the medicine side of things you've got chronic pain smoke this if you if you're depressed smoke this hey you're feeling nausea i've got something for you take two of these and call me in the morning and loss of appetite you'll never go hungry again well actually no no that's the loss of appetite is the fact that i forget that sorry i've had not much sleep but i have not had much weed as well and i'm gonna be smoking some very very soon i promise y'all promise you've got make this quick video yeah right so quick hurry up hurry up it's now into the categories of the i don't know i'm smelling it i should be looking at it it's the site oh i just dropped it i didn't drop it i just picked it up by really a really really weak part of the bud and then the rest just stayed on the floor so i know a lot of people go he's always dropping the bud officially i didn't drop this bud officially the bud dropped itself before it even took off the ground is that even possible i don't think that counts as dropping no anyway here it is we're looking at the sites out of 10 first of all i think why do i keep smelling it because it smells so lovely i can't wait for category number two but stop spinning it okay looking at this right now no let's be serious we're never serious on string killers are we if you want serious read reviews you're on the wrong [ __ ] channel i'll tell you that now anyway sound effects oh there's no sound effects because i'm going raw i keep forgetting i'm raw [ __ ] i've got no powers look nothing's happening ah hold on [Music] i've got a little bit of power okay so let's look at this site first thing i'm noticing about this is the crystals is very powdered very frosty extremely frosty uh and probably the most frost i've seen on a gorilla glue strain or grilling glue cross very light in color very very light in color yellowy light greens here and the shapes of these buds again not big fat round ones they're all very quite thin yeah so as i said the buds are not that fat and big they're all very similar shapes actually um sight on this one going to score up very quickly because we've got to hurry up i'm going to give this because of the frost it does help it out not your hardest of nugs definitely not that compressed that was a bit tired to be honest but still a lot of give so i'm gonna give this a seven and a half for its site average right now just average but don't worry we're smelling it now we've got seven and a half for the site we're smelling it and i cannot stop smelling it it really does have that green more or less gorilla glue smell coming from here can't really smell black cherry i think i've had the black cherry before so i wouldn't know what to look out for or smell out for but uh it is lovely easily slight bit of citrusy fruitness in there and i always find a bit of fruitness from the gorilla glue so i don't know if there's also some cherry going in there as well but mainly uh diesely the diesel dirt these will dirt with a hint of citrusy berry and i know that's weird because berries aren't citrusy but right now that's exactly what i'm getting berry citrus is that is that even legal it's against the law you can't say that i'm going to smoke this i'm not i'm not going to like give this to some innocent person and they can get coronavirus now if i've got the corona it's only me that's going to be affected and i can't affect myself can i so stop sticking up your nose [Music] it's a really nice smell uh not the nicest is in like i've had because i'm loving this because it's dank but there's other dankier smells out there from other strains but i do like the smell so i'm gonna score this up i'm gonna give it an eight eight seven and a half and eight let's go quick we've gotta hurry up let's go to the taste and i do have to skin this up okay i've got the joint rolled up we're running out of time i've gotta go dennis soon let's have a painkiller also i'm just guaranteed that someone's going to knock on my door or someone's going to ring the phone so i'll hurry up people do apologize although this is a complete new format well it's not a completely new format but it's an old format that i'm bringing back again slightly different because i'm using my phone and trying to do it all in one take yeah right as if that's going to happen i'll do my best the main thing is to get these reviews out there quicker than i am doing right now at the moment third category the taste you actually do you know what you can't really smell the cherry when they're smelling it you can definitely taste the cherry on this i'm a fan of cherry tasting stuff as well i had a black cherry alcopop yesterday so i've still got cherry fresh in the brain yeah definitely cherry also you're getting your diesel dieselness from the gorilla glue still quite sweet as well i always think grilla glue's taste is not as a strong point it's definitely more on the effects uh for gorilla glue four it's very dirty strain taste i think this is a sweeter version this is like grilling four but a sweeter version of it i've heard that some people can taste coffee in this again one of them tastes that you think more of once you know about it so now i know there's there's coffee in there or no i know the people have tasted coffee from the strain i can now taste coffee from it but to be honest with you and i want to be as honest as i possibly can if someone gave me this and told me to write down 10 tastes that i'm getting from this i don't think coffee would be one of them but i can see where they come from it is a bit of a coffee taste to this its main taste though is definitely the gorilla glue diesel with diesel edge and then the sweetness from it as well these are nice i mean i do like the taste of gorilla glue some people don't like it some people don't like a lot of people i know do not like any kind of diesel strains they think they get headaches from them and they don't like the taste of them as well that's not me i actually do like the taste of grilling glue and i think this tastes better than grilling for yeah definitely screw it up i'm gonna give this a high one actually for the taste better than the sight better than the smell the taste of grilling glue to the taste black cherry cross gorilla glue form which is black cherry get that right so i can't do it i've gotta have some takes i've got something it takes gotta do it again where was i let's begin black cherry definitely tasting the griller glue from this however i can't remember what i was gonna say i completely put myself off i'm gonna score this high we had seven and a half for the site we had eight for the smell for the taste of it i'm gonna give it an eight and a half really happy so we're going up half and half and half does that mean when we get down to the effects we're gonna give this a nine find out because we are now covering the effects the effects what is it doing to me right now well i've spoke this a few times uh prior to this review so i know the effects already i'm not going to give the effects after smoking it for a few seconds that would be stupid but i know the effects are definitely uh a mixture of the two the black cherry and the gorilla glue the gorilla glue 4 is usually just pure up couch luggage not going to be moving it's gonna among you out and you're getting that massive body gloopy feeling dripping down from your head all the way down to your toes uh i know from smoking this i've smoothly during the daytime as well in fact i've actually waken baits with this and i've carried on as normal um probably due to this specific probably due to its 50 probably due to its 50 50 percent sativa and hybrid what am i talking about what am i talking about i can't do reviews i can't do reviews i need i need to have some time to think pick up anyone that does do these reviews and does it first take because that is a lot of hard work and experience i think you have to be experienced on talking so much without these things happening i just can't do it i really can't do it but yes the effects 50 50. would it be giving me 50 50 on the effects i think so because yes couch lockage definitely i could feel that nice warm gloopy gloppy stone body stoneless feeling from head to toe but i have been very creative on this i have been doing lots of editing i've been doing lots of work lots of housework on the house i'm a housewife believe it or not yes so this does not stop me during my um daily chores uh if i was smoking critical four yeah i wouldn't be doing [ __ ] or i'll be literally on the sofa and pissing my pants and [ __ ] myself i wouldn't be that bad but yeah you know what i mean this it feels like i'll be having enough energy to get off the couch and go to the toilet so this would stop me from pooing myself so if you're pouring yourself on gorilla glue four just get black cherry a mixture in it and get the gorilla cherry you'd be fine to go to the toilet you'll have enough energy to wipe your own bum so the effects [Laughter] on the effects on this is gonna score again another another higher one and you know what i'm not doing this to keep the nice pattern going like that but i am going to give this a nine for the effects we've gone seven and a half we've gone eight we've got eight and a half we've gone nine i've never had that happen before on a weed view and i promise you it's not on purpose it's the way i feel this is very good uh my eyes look at my eyes my eyes are getting heavy already i can feel that already and that's a good sign to say that this is working only 17 roughly thc oh and someone's at my door hold on and hopefully no more interruptions let's finish this off yes so even though it is um more of a body stone this i still am getting quite uplifting effects i wish my eyes were uplifting they're not they're down lifting um here they are getting really heavy my eyes but yeah very uplifting still i'm still talking quite quickly and my speech would be affected with the gorilla glue on it just on its own but the black cherry is definitely keeping me going i'm guessing black cherry must be a sativa or a hybrid gorilla glue's a hybrid this is 50 50. i can't remember the last time i had a streak down the middle sativa indica hybrid how about yourself let us know in the comments section i also find from gorilla glue it's not really a happy strain to smoke you're not really like oh really happy and cheerful it's more i'm like down now well i still feel quite happy and um yeah just get about my daily strain which is good best of both worlds so i'm really liking this for the effects as i said i'm giving it a nine it's gone up try and let this up in fact let's not do that i've got a little bit of power i've got a little bit of power and here is the score for cherry gorilla also known as cherry gorilla glue um but yeah cherry cherry gorilla or cg if we quit cg probably not but yeah cherry gorilla loving this really liking it there's the score sorry it's going all over the place but i am trying a new format to get these views out there the wii views are one of my favorites to record but they also one of the hardest to edit as well so this one hopefully not too much editing should be out very soon hopefully get it out with the next day or two it is wednesday today it's a weed's day so it wouldn't be nice because they always film my reviews on a wednesday but they never come out on a wednesday unless it's like two or three years after that wednesday then they usually come out but yeah hopefully i can get this out today so wednesday the 20 is it the 30th i don't know what's the [ __ ] date wednesday the 30th september is it out did it go out today let me know in the comment section below actually you don't need to let me know in the comment section below because i'm the person that uploads it so i will know as well if i make me on deadline or not anyway i'm walking way too much this is cherry gorilla cross with black cherry and gorilla glue 4 great great hybrid smoked it before let us know in the comments section did you enjoy this video or would you prefer the other weed views that take quite some time to make if you did like it let us know in the comment section below my name is rizzler this is strangers i'll see you later bye you", "FjXiGq9JV8A": "[Music] easy now guys today we're taking a quick look

coming from the USA or Switzerland like I say obviously they offer different products such as tinters vaping juices in different flavors variants and capsules edibles looking at the edible sections and mixed gummy rings I would absolutely love to try some of those at some point and maybe some of the luxury CBD infused chocolate bars be interesting to see how they actually work by ingesting them how long it takes etiquette in and not also the actual effects CBD bath products available as well as Hand and Body Lotion pain relief cream obviously if you're into your fitness and maybe go to the gym and you get like injuries on your back etc something like a pain relief cream might be that might be the way forward and actually help you as opposed to taking sort of like your prescription pills

YouTube it's your boy bacon baby today I just wanted to bring you guys a very quick update I've been m.i.a for about a week now just kind of laying low because the whole YouTube thing that's going on right now a lot of big weed tubers getting banned videos getting blocked I've already had several videos removed so keep it short and sweet took some clones these were the clones that were just got done rooting so got these four right here or Gorilla Glue those are the BTY og they're just in some Empire Builder probably a little hot for them but they'll grow into it they'll be okay I popped some seeds here I popped for Blue Lightning which is a cost between Blue Dream and Northern Lights number five to be specific so got one of those popped two of those popped and this is also some Empire Builder which is probably gonna be too hot for fresh seedlings but and we'll see it's not as hot as roots organic so should be okay so two of the blue lightning it popped so far and broke ground and then this is an ak-47 that I got from my buddy in Spain so I popped three of these which is all I have so two of those were just barely starting to crack the seed open when I put them in here so we'll see how they do I had a sex all these out gorilla glue mom is doing good really good but she's probably gonna get retired because I don't like the fact that it's in there and the grow damn it's doing extremely well I mean it's extremely Hardy and everything yeah I think it's just time to pull it out I pulled out the BTY oh gee mom already and let this die off because I needed to use that dirt for all those clothes but uh yeah that's it for the quick little bedroom update and let me take you guys down to the flowers and show you what's going on down there all right so here you are down at the 10th and I just want to show you guys when my fan is on this tent gets sucked in so much that's a 5 by 9 pushes in so like a 4 by 8 and the entire canopy is damn near surrounded like Point Blank by the reflectiveness of the tent cuz it sucks in so much it's great so these are in the start of week 5 technically but uh they've been in 1212 for 7 days they've been getting transition newts and today they're gonna get their first dose full on flour nutrients BTY og over here is doing amazing everything is stacking wonderfully having those veg bulbs in still for the first two weeks makes a tremendous difference and the Gorilla Glue is also doing amazing these were stripped a lot in week 3 right before I flipped them and they just bushed out so it's time to go back in and remove some of the stuff from the bottom that's just definitely never gonna catch up and then I'll go back up to the top remove some of these fan leaves that are blocking the rest of the canopy from getting really good light and that's it and you can see the light rail is really doing a fantastic job pushing this light all the way over to the very edge of the canopy and making sure that I stretch out the canopy full length all the way to the side so that's just it's really working out well really enjoying it these Fantin lives are getting huge and I can't wait to go through here and do some defoliation and open up this canopy and just let that light penetrate all the way down through to the bottom still got some light penetration down here most of that's reflecting off the wall you can see on this gorilla glue side it's just dense there's nothing getting through there so we'll clean that up give it some fresh flour newts right now and give it a quick spray with some bloom chaos we'll be good to go quickly I just wanted to touch on if you guys don't see any videos from me for a while about rosin and whatnot it's because YouTube's really cracking down on these weed tubers and banning accounts I have so much content out there on my channel from growing to extraction and processing that I'm a little concerned that my accounts going to get banned because I've had several people reporting me recently that just I I guess they're haters or whatever they're not smoking enough weed but man hopefully I can keep this content coming to you guys if not on YouTube hit up my Instagram at solvent list underscore bacon vape and yeah stay tuned because this is about to get crazy in here [Applause] that said it's time to go mix up some of these fresh nuts which I won't be doing anymore because this super soil is on deck getting cooked on up and I am excited for it alright y'all that's it for me bacon vape out", "zDR8SFjOrBI": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] yo yo yo what is up YouTube it's your boy bacon babe we are in the bedroom everything just got cleaned up nice and good beams of all the messy dirt I had on the ground most importantly I finally transplanted all of my plants from one gallon styrofoam cups up to three gallon containers we have the three Blue Lightning over here they will make an outstanding bounce back I'm absolutely positive I'm excited to see what they look like as they grow up pretty sure they're gonna be some really beefy monsters plants because they were pre deficient right from the bat within a week of being in those cups so they're hungry and the person that gave me the strain told me they could handle whatever I throw at them so all of these containers got about 2/3 of the way full of super soil and so there should be plenty to get things through until flour now if springs veg all the way through harvest supposedly for this super soil so we'll see how it goes we got three Gorilla Glue also in here in the tub they're not doing too bad they don't need too much nutrients they can handle a lot but they also don't need a lot which is great so I expect them to fully recover bounce back and start thriving as well and then outside here a little bit further from the leg we got the BT y ou G now these guys were really deficient lacking in basically everything but I also expect them to fully bounce back now that that's a super soil going and basically what I did is I chose I had for Gorilla Glue to choose from before the BT yov when I chose just to keep three of each one for space and two just because I really don't need that many so I chose the three three best at each one based on the structure their stem size and they're developed now so I don't expecting these guys to all bounce back fairly quickly and it's gonna be a jumbling here probably be very soon so be nice to get these out of here and get them flowering as soon as I pull the other ones out and yeah gotta get some more yellow sticky traps in here because I've got little [ __ ] like that popping up here and there so we're gonna get rid of those [ __ ] so we got a little sticky traps and we'll be good to go it's been a long day of transplanting cleaning so Cheers it's time to go relax you guys have a good night baking paper", "L--jVf0ntJE": "hello everyone welcome to another video we've got some news on gorilla glue girl a bit of an update yeah the chick that decided to cover her head in superglue what an absolute gob job this whole thing is she has managed to raise 21k from this that's big boy money that however though gorilla glue has uh released a statement saying the following we are aware of the situation and we are very sorry to hear about the unfortunate incident the ms frank experience using our spray additive on her hair this is a unique situation you don't say because this product is not indicated for use in or on a hair as if it is considered permanent osprey additive states that in the warning label do not swallow do not get in eyes on skin or on clothing ah can't believe she missed that one it is used for craft home auto or office projects to mount things to surfaces such as paper cardboard wood laminate and fabric ah so ravishing fair play to them although i don't know uh i don't know why this was needed though i'll be honest but you know fair play to them i mean it doesn't take much does it to know that you shouldn't be putting that on your head all right it's worrying how people can't read labels on products it's quite insane it's hilarious that they've had to put this statement out to be honest what world do we live in now superglue in your hair all right to be honest it's not a surprise since it was floating around that gorilla glue girl was actually going to sue gorilla glue company i mean it's just a bit of common sense love that ain't gonna fly i don't think you can actually sue anyone for your own stupidity i think that's on you there before you know it you'll be like no the glue i just fell out my hands i didn't put it on my hair i didn't but it turns out it wasn't true anyway someone has been lying staring their four as an air she came out and denied the claims that she was filing a lawsuit against gorilla glow company oh there's so so many words for this one i don't know where this is all coming from there you go maybe that brain ain't filled with air after all i don't know actually i'll spit far fetch that that would be the dumbest move if she did do that i would have actually laughed into next year so after all the burning there is some good news that is we are glad to see that in her recent video that miss brown has received medical treatment from her local medical facility and we wish her the best yeah so this this girl did actually get treatment this guy did the treatment to get the glue out of her hair for free for free a 12k treatment you know here's the video i love to see it she can finally ruin our fingers so her hair that's beautiful i can only imagine the struggle she went through the pain the suffering you can't be doing stuff like that to your end it just needs a bit of a sour taste though not gonna lie i'm always here with a sour taste a woman did something stupid on her own accord because you know she couldn't read and started trending and got free treatment and 21k in the bank g is this real life i don't know just the moral standpoint here um hopefully she gives that 21k to people that actually need treatment i don't know how these chickens bunked off this that would be our deal if you can help others through this situation i respect that and i rate it oh yeah because she's that famous now she's got a manager can you imagine in what world what world you get a manager for literally putting super glue in your hair these days no well this is actually bizarre but her management her management company is now going around striking youtube videos because of that big boy 21k ain't enough ham nah they need more incomes now listen here uh no listen here cause this this logic is as daft as a drag queef well you should be thanking the people that made videos or else it won't be as popular just part down a little bit yeah what are you doing i hate these management companies with the ties up their ass looking like human kebabs treat youtubers like modding grassmate disgusting think what you're doing yeah think what you're doing before you do it yeah geez hopefully they stop with that i mean they're probably just trying to milk this situation as much as possible before the old population moves on with their lives let's be honest here because she's not gonna do it again now is she well you'd like to think at least could go either way to be honest but yeah glad this woman got it out and all great quite surprised she didn't lose around the process though seeing as gorilla glue literally destroyed mine in five minutes but okay fair play one actual joke this says she could now feel the wind through her hair i don't i bet her head was all stiffy in here wow it sounded better if i edited till i said it to be honest cool i still don't know i should it to be honest how do you put soup glue in your hair i will never know oh what a joke this whole thing is anyway guys i keep watching this video i hope you take care super close you", "Q8xa3f7P4HM": "banning then wrong smoking weed weed is

kind just snuck up out of nowhere did we have to do we did that [ __ ] crazy crazy trichomes oh we got she don't stop don't stop it all oh my god I get even that as energy oh man so we got to find a peace here I think I'm seeing something up here in this top corner here that looks like something might work right yeah it looks like it might be the one yeah there we go that look that actually is the smallest but definitely not the least my name is Lee look at that [ __ ] oh my god yes that's only medication peace for right now and I'm really excited about that right work okay so yeah that's definitely probably why you really might want to consider just you know pause in this video it's positive plus going to healing corner calm the healing corner calm up in the top red screen you're gonna see a little bun this is Canton feel requests that you want to press that button you want to go down to the section this is flowers you want to scroll down until you see the advanced CRO labs hybrid all are then a little button or anything says Add to Cart click that Add to Cart button and then fill out your information take a nice ride down to the hearing or from there hey what's up chief and then grab your bag acrylic look going home unpause this video and you're medicated with me anyway I don't know if you pause alas that long but see no that little buddy to go we'll see how it breaks up [ __ ] stinks I'm trying to get two balls out of it do maybe two smaller bowls we'll find out might be two walls I'm gonna have to like break off a tiny tiny little corner son else maybe not now when you break this [ __ ] up you didn't like this incredibly like sweet marijuana smell I don't know why smells almost sugary right now in front of me it could be that ridiculous amount of number of trichomes that are just sitting all over it yes that's one bowl baby Jules I feel a little bit closer here my beat Mitch break off tiny tiny tiny bit more anything sweet just because and in your lap basically just enough to fill up that second ball all right guys mm-hmm the Gorilla Glue well the GG FK oh and uh I got a couple other patients asked recently what this is that I'm doing this isn't a dab tool this is a hat one you know familiar with this is a hot wand it's kind of like homemade hot ones we're all can have one but duct tape on those graciously gifting that one of our fellow patients then I kind of broke half duct tape down a little corn cat Boulder what a hot one does is you basically heat up your wand and then your cell vaporizing your flower this is using a flower that concentrates soon get any butane even any of the extra like just Ksenia just removing like ham quick or anything I'm gonna tell you the flavors better the effect is way more potent like believe me and your marijuana actually gets stretched out along because it's so potent that it actually use less no one I swear to God should change my life just try how much you think anybody else out there uses a hot wand or just try this the same kind of shown in VA and let me know I mean what you think what the hell glue number four and so let's just it's actually really really really smooth I could hold that she writing cleared the whole ball up all right that glue effect it's totally Ojo as I exhale it was wheeling I exhale but then I felt like sounds weird like I felt like I got in cloaked by like something you're probably kind just wrapped over me kind of like almost like a safety blanket it's weird all right weird comparison maybe I was like maybe locked all the anxiety or an omni in the world but it felt like I think we need Katie put a blanket over you to protect yourself from the AIDS scared that you would weird like that felt like a weird like it sounds stupid like the [ __ ] you talking about Charlie I think a safety bike you want over he was weird that's nice like okay again hey can't rock me from stands out a little baby really spazzed out feeling pretty normal right now no the next one I'll probably feel pretty medicated instar usually takes me to balls I don't usually go over to bowls Rhea tops you never catch me smoking four or five balls back-to-back because it's just too much medication to be honest at that point it doesn't even do anything more than that the second ball ditch me aside just stop doing it okay hey two balls and I'm good I'm medicated leave my Medicaid and I'm also getting done with you get down in life I guess and that's lacking I'm this last ball I'm gonna [ __ ] out of Dodge a highly medicated [Music] supertype shells medication right there alright guys I'm up GCT movies I'll be back on Sunday with Darrin poison be good I've seen Valerie know the same weekend yeah it got medicated", "qvbbS49VaNE": "all right so i did a little pre-leafing d-leafing um and honestly i picked this up from watching urban remo i don't know if y'all ever checked out urban remo but dude is dope basically you take all the fan leaves off you come out here and trim your plants a week before you pick them so that way once you do harvest them it's a lot less trim work you got to deal with and if you've harvested multiple plants and trimmed you know after hour two or three it's really not fun anymore but uh yeah look they look pretty they look they look nice now got all the fan leaves off sorry i can't stay still i'm getting [ __ ] attacked

it's hot right now dropping it like it's hot so let's go ahead and crack this beautiful nug open and see what it looks like as you can see right here you could just see the curation on this I mean if you could see it's still you know it's still got that squish to it but you hear that crack and that pop from it being cured so well if it's cure just right from what I believe and from my experience it should still be fluffy it should have very little moisture in it but it should not be dry not it should not be bone-dry this right here you could see the trichomes on this are ridiculous the terpene profile is like wow I've been smoking on it and one thing I could tell you is the flavors there definitely there it is mouth-watering look at that man that is crazy go man let's crack it open Yale Wow holy smokes do you see that that right there is beauty pure beauty let's see crack the crown off the tip let's see how it goes you that is awesome and insane great medicine sorry about the

"check it out what if I told you a guerrilla [ __ ] up I I walked into my dispensary today and they said Chris no ketchup we're so excited that you're here because we have a cherry gorilla back in stock I said me lucky omigod dang well the last time I came through looking for it they didn't have it now I got it it's a good thing it's a good day even folks who don't smoke weed know about gorilla glue they know about the string they know about the strains popularity and they might have heard about when the gorilla glue like glue and tape company like no [ __ ] reached out and was like yeah you guys can't call that gorilla glue anymore so GG for gorilla glue no matter what you call it I have that crossed with cherry pie to make cherry gorilla of course you already know who it's by it's by Verano I promise in the future I'll choose different cultivators to do strain reviews on I know I've done a lot of rano but I couldn't pass this up guys cherry pie was in the forbidden fruit that's right the genetics of forbidden fruit contain cherry pie you guys have gotten to see what it does to buds making them dark deep and a real stinkiness and a nice stinky sweetness to him the resonation of gorilla glue crossed with that this is a first sniff I'm pretty stoked about so let's hit it I don't know why I do that it's always backwards it always has the foil on it but breaking seals break and seals that first sniff on cherry gorilla it's beautiful man that looks good y'all see what I'm talking about oh my god beautiful little geodes oh oh wow haha Wow man oh this was so worth waiting for Wow oh my goodness it is so clear to see the gorilla glue properties of this look how tri combed out this is I can already oh my god I can already feel my fingers dude oh how lucky are we honestly how lucky are we guys just oh [ __ ] not the first sniff I thought but um totally worth it [ __ ] round oh my god this is beautiful I just realized I don't think I said anything about what it smelled like in that first sniff kind of a completely [ __ ] defeating the purpose of it excuse me maybe it's death the funkiness of the Cherry Pie was there but was not the main dominating smell a very piney um visceral I'll use that word it was a visceral pine enos um for sure the main terpene component to this cherry gorilla bud where is [Music] well I found it almost called a gorilla pie that sounds like the [ __ ] nastiest food on this planet mmm grill up high what am i smoke cherry gorilla god damn I'm not even high it just an idiot you saw the light transition there you know I'm high like I'm hard hard okay okay I don't have a lot of remarks about the flavor on it's not what's punching me in the face right now every time I smell Gorilla Glue or a cross of it I'd say the potencies the the topic on my mind as it is right now [ __ ] rat oh I bought took a dab of this I think I'd have to what do we like I think I took took that hit like three minutes ago Oh God again hi hi tonight god isn't that [ __ ] crazy dude [Music] what the [ __ ] well I wanted to come in and let you know the effects of just simply the first day of me smoking it I was tired of [ __ ] the second I took another poll of this I'm just right back in it that the [ __ ] the Gorilla Glue aspect I know I keep repeating myself on this but it's truly this is the the fuel of this strain is the Gorilla Glue yes the oh yes the Cherry Pie brings a nice balance of sweetness to this cherry gorilla but the real star of the show is the Gorilla Glue I just wanted to let you guys know this stuff is right there with the G perps you know the g6 jet fuel in regards to that just [ __ ] kill him dead energy man oh my god yeah mine look at them fritters I look so angelic look around alright let's hit this [ __ ] holy hit yeah this is the holy hit right here a fresh shape of cherry gorilla what's it tell me some of the reported effects are well one of them is positive mood I'm so [ __ ] hungry I haven't eaten all day just got home from a long day of work to see a whole bunch of trash in my bed didn't close the trash my dog got into it and spewed it all around my bed I'm telling you this to say I'm not in a good mood right now by no means however I do have this fresh a of cherry gorilla that I got so we can get a final toke and thought on this it's a fantastic hybrid let's just get that out of the way for its effects it's perfect I'm right there in the middle right there in the middle between stimulation and sedation oh that's way [ __ ] stinkier than the first batch okay okay already that mood is starting to get a little bit better holy [ __ ] this is a really nice eh okay if I drop one of you [ __ ] I'm ending it all the vibrancy of this strain gets me every time however my god my god does that cherry pie really push through I want to live in a van down by the river Oh oh my god yeah yeah I'm not not really having a bad bad of a day anymore whoa now for the elephant in the room this shit's too [ __ ] dry man what the [ __ ] seriously it has gotten ridiculous I used to be able to look at goldleaf slash Murano as my hey yeah I'm paying $60 a [ __ ] eighth but the smoke is good the quality of the cure was done right for every good fresh nug I've gotten from Verano I get like eight more that our mummy edition bone-dry y'all I put my flame to this and I can just see how dry this bud is it doesn't burn correctly it kind of all becomes a little incinerator um but what am I really saying here I'm not saying any new information for the Illinois medical cannabis scene that's for sure we are used to overpriced over dried over cured bud um if I had any goal for legalization it would be to start introducing growers and strains that are given that extra little time detail and effort to ensure they come out to be better smokes listen y'all I'm not gonna say it's not good bud look at the key flying off of this clearly I mean goddamn just even look at them grinder teeth in the grinder teeth just from that but [ __ ] around y'all this is drier than [ __ ] man it's one of those things that with time I know we'll get better because all the cultivators are afraid of getting mold I understand that I don't like that though I would hope with the price that Illinois medical patients pay for these buds I would hope the cultivators could go the extra step to ensure the product arrives as it should but we'll just have to see I'm Chris no ketchup thank you for turning into this review of cherry gorilla by Verano it was even though the bud was dry it was still fun to smoke to make this video appreciate all the support and I'll talk to you guys soon", "NXfygOSCSDs": "you too oh why what's happening everybody coming back at you with another grow I know I've been afk for a little while but uh I got everything sorted out and got the next little grow up and running here today is actually day one now flowering on the right here we've got a silver la it's a really nice hybrid one of my favorites really good for concentrates and on the left over here we're rocking the gorilla glue number four this is also another string that's been treated me really well soil or hydro have been no issues with that and I guess I'm not running neither this time I'm running boy sunshine number four so basically a Coco a Coco grow it then we got there to 600 watts same old 600 watts as always yeah just really looking forward to seeing what these two plants can do in Cocoa I just had to stop running the hydros have too many problems with with gnats and things like that especially right now in the middle of summer I walk out my back door here and there's just freaking bugs everywhere I can't keep him out of my garage here where I've got my groom set out so sticking with soil a little easier to manage in terms of pests seems like once pests get in your hydro system you're pretty screwed but in soil you can sort of do you know do some things to keep them at bay and things like that you know you get your beneficials run some ladybugs things like that so I'll be doing a bunch of that yeah Evan this is just day one one let you guys know I'm still here so let me put some content out for you I'm trying out this new video mode here if I may do the next video in 4k or you know once the once the plants start developing buds etc but yeah we're just Brendon uh and advance peach perfect there Scentsy the cocoa grow formula so I got the a and the B I've been running these guys they've been vetted in here for about a month or two so you can see this uh I did a lollipop just yesterday cleaned out the bottom side I got him veg din to the scrog pretty good you know there should be a decent see a green once things get takeoff and flowering yeah I'm really looking forward to this cocoa I ran it with the buddy and his and I turned out really well so I'm really anxious to see what how this can do here despite not running hydro the other ladies are they're doing good and looking good so Gigi they seem to be taking the notes really well don't seem to have any issues and this gorilla is a heavy feeder so I really got to watch the newts on on her the silver is doing great too though you know I'll check back with you guys in a in a week or so and we'll see will what's happening Mario peace", "2g9WWLy93Cg": "yo what up YouTube it's your boy bacon babe everybody's been asking for an update on the outdoor grill igloo mom so here it is growing it's doing really nicely it's about to get some boiler spray right now it's got a mix of some bloom chaos which contains hummock acid silica and a bunch of other ingredients and I put some recharge in here a couple drops of oregano essential oil peppermint essential oil and SM 90 and I'm just going to go through here and spray this down because we have got some nut spider mites yet but uh there's insects on here and I don't want to move here so I don't have any of my yellow sticky traps up and there's all types of little flying insects in here mad annoying so we're just gonna go ahead and give this plant a good spray down but yeah this thing has just been growing on its own I haven't really done anything to it haven't topped it it's not sure if I'm going to and getting watered but once every four to five days it's not in direct sunlight so it doesn't get a lot of intense lighting which is great because it's given me some slow growth because I haven't had time to get out here and put up the the black tarp over this every night at 6:00 or 6:30 you know I use a Sun Rise Sun set app on my phone that tells me what time the Sun is coming up and down every day and I just don't have time to get out here really and do it so I may just let this thing do it do its own thing just let it continue to veg and then flower on its own but that won't be until the end of June or so that it starts to do that so we'll see how it goes if it looks like it's gonna have slow enough growth to where I could let it just veg on its own and I don't mind doing that because I can even pull this greenhouse top off or extend it it doesn't really matter to me but anyways we're gonna go through here spray this down and hopefully this will take care of any issues before they get going because I'm not a big fan of pests being an indoor grower and yeah it's something new to get used to I got to make sure that anytime I work on this I go and wash my hands and change my clothes before I go and work on the other garden just because I don't want to transfer any pests over anything like that so that's that I'm gonna finish finish spraying this up and then that'll be it and I'll update you guys in another week or two on this", "5YOI4r5u8so": "[Music] wonderful stuff man this is from the guerrilla grew strains I love guerrilla gue number four and from what I found out gorilla glue number five is a cross between gorilla glue number one and good a rule number four so good strains man and this is a goods train from what I found out well I couldn't find any information but this definitely feels like it's in the kendama train I couldn't find any exact THC information and in fact I went to the website and they said very high THC but I couldn't find any actual numbers but um this is a very relaxed and happy kind of a smoke its euphoric and giggly well under the right conditions man if if your solo strolling with this stuff it's gonna be very cauchy's commit locked up or he that's how I fell it's like this could be a kind of sedating kind of a strain I asked him is pretty hard the first time I got this and some music it was chilling I was like man I was on a whole nother level but I also medicated with this throughout the day and I found every time I medicate with this I wound up going asleep man I just got super super comfortable and you're just super chill man there's a little bit of confidence while we're taking a quick toke talk a little more about this treatment cuz it's really really wonderful it's nice it's got a wonderful high but it also settles into this nice stone um well I think I think compare this to us think of a more indica version of gorilla goo number four it's got pretty much the same taste and smell it's got that gassy earthy tiny pungency you know it's nothing man it's got great bag appeal real nice bud sticky they smell wonderful man it's a really good stray I had to grind some up man just to get the full effect super chill man from what I found out this is good for stuff like nausea and headaches great for a body ache specially for that go Beach all a come home you get all aching or your muscles this is good for that hair stuff wonderful like after workout smoke this is a perfect strange for like at the end of the day when y'all exhaust in you need to take a break after you working in the yard you know you're hot and sore the other guy waking baked with this pie was back in bed freakin snooze in like 45 minutes after was doing my giveaway I was like I came outside like did away came back with this gorilla number five man she's as soon as I'm done I went back and got to sleep this think it's pretty quick that's why you feel the effects pretty pretty fast especially all up in the head wonderful it's got a wonderful high solid pain relief very relaxing if I had to pick a favorite time to medicate with this it would have to be like definitely my time but it's really good if you have good people around you if you're still solo stoning this man it's gonna be he's super strong and super-quick you know but if you've got fun people around like especially in your families yeah like the holidays they were cracking jokes reminiscing laughing having fun this is a wonderful strain for that kind of stuff wonderful social smoke especially for the end of the day like you know after dinner go outside burn a couple bowls of this come back here for dessert freaking decide I have fun and after I were to go then you go sleep perfect timing cuz every time I medicated with this I always wind up like wanting to go asleep it just makes me super comfortable it's good for the body man especially we got like some tensions good for that releases the tension not just physically emotionally to men if you've got some issues you just can't let go try medicate with this maybe Medicaid then meditate you'll find yourself is kind of it's it's just like it's really good so I can say very good for distressing wonderful distressing man and it's couples happy euphoric vibe so probably good for your depression I swear I'll get you out any kind of low mood it's a wonderful strain if you like a good number for you gotta try this doc man number four I can blast that all day long morning noon night I love that stuff this one mmm probably more for the evening so this is like your evening gorilla glue you know gorilla number four five you at daytime this might be a night time Oh wonderful spent I would totally ground this again I would love to see the shatter of the stuff man gorilla number four I mean number five she's I still got a bunch of this stuff left man because I don't smoke this during the day man I'm I smoked this at night and sometimes I'm really good by the evening time and stuff so this stuff is sometimes very strong it's long lasting anyhow I didn't want this video got too long it's a wonderful frame man Gordon number five if we're gonna get a chance to check it out I didn't experience any munchies with this which is kind of strange because most I can't be eating because you know I get like oh I get munchies hardcore no munchies with distil but I didn't experience the dry mouth and the dry eyes cottonmouth there have some drinks handy with this and some pills bracha this thing is pretty comfy anyhow wonderful strain was totally ground mcgarricle number five", "Ui7rI9e8Gvo": "oh yeah teresa right yet i just wanted to forget the the operation was successful and everything went smoothly okay right so right now finally i take a look at yourself tonight thank you doctor i was a loner why look like a man ah yeah well well take a look on the bright side just be anywhere by the road now without make this mistake again freak reviews yeah if who is get against them after we mix up the before learning cancer him", "KdhbDI5zZ68": "tj back again what's going on guys i want to talk to you guys about the gorilla glue girl again i just wanted to give you guys a little inside baseball i've gotten a lot of hate um most of those comments were removed by google but i can still see the comments before google removes them a lot of people especially from the african-american community was hating on me because of my view that the gorilla glue girl may be a fraud um unfortunately it feels i i feel like the african american community has been so marginalized for so long that we feel like we got to stick up for each other no matter what even if we're wrong so we look at cases like jacob blake i always bring him up because i feel like it's a great example of sticking up for somebody who you would not want to date your daughter your sister your friend so if your daughter comes home and says this is my boyfriend this is jacob blake and you know who jacob blake is you know his resume so let's say they meet him a year from now you would be like nah get this guy out my house man no disrespect to him but i don't want you to see him why because you know him to be a woman beater you know him to be somebody who has a drinking problem somebody who's accused of sexual assault and all these things that led up to him resisting arrest and getting shot whether you want to agree with that or not it's a fact whether you think that the police shooting him was racially motivated or not that's your opinion you could believe that there's nothing wrong with believing whatever you feel in fact our beliefs are informed by our experience so if you've had nothing but bad experiences with police officers if you've had racially charged encounters with police officers then it's only natural that you're going to believe or stare more towards the fact that if there's a negative interaction between a police officer and african-american that is racially charged you have a right to believe that but it's still a fact and it's still documented that jacob blake is all of those things that i described but yet people still feel like they need to support him no matter what without acknowledging his past and acknowledging the things that he did leading up to that and then i said a key word i said past so people say well that was that person's past well no in cases like jacob blake their past literally dictated their present and their future at the time because their past is the reason why the cops was there in the first place so we look at this gorilla glue lady and we see that it's clear that is a high probability that this woman who's a teacher this woman who is very talented with arts and crafts and has worked with different types of glue for years this is all from her personal instagram and tick tock pages that you get this information somebody who's 40 years old who's not a little kid who's not a child somebody who works with children and when you work with children as a teacher part of a teaching tool is doing arts and crafts so i keep emphasizing arts and crafts she does arts and crafts to sell to make extra money she does uses glues for her hair on a regular because that's her style and you'll see pictures on the internet of her having that same hairstyle for years prior to this moment that is her go-to style and she says she uses a specific type of hair glue to achieve that style so she's a person who knows her way around getting her hair done and around hair and black hair which has its own unique texture and then she's a teacher so she's intelligent and she has common sense and then this person comes to you and tells you that they put super glue construction adhesive in their hair and expected to just wash it out at the end of the day then we look at other facts the lady had the glue in her hair for a month who waits an entire month 30 days possibly 31 days depending on what month it is to say all right enough is enough like i'm gonna now go in to the doctor i i don't get it it doesn't make sense and then when she makes the video she makes us this video her hair looks immaculate it looks perfectly glued down to her head perfectly gel down i should say rather even i'm buying into the glue it there's no chafing there's no peeling there's no cracking there's nothing it's just perfectly matted down with a high gloss slash sheen do you guys really think super glue would dry like that on air of course not while the glue is curing which only takes a couple of seconds mind you the hair would be flexing the skin would be flexing and it would cause cracks and fissures in the glue it does that with your hands when you put super glue on your hands by accident what do you think it would do with your hair be 10 times worse with your hair you know it doesn't make any sense and then super glue takes literally seconds to start to harden wouldn't the brush get stuck in her hair or start to glue itself wouldn't her hand start sticking in her hair like that would be the most messy proposition what about the rest of her head what about the back of her neck what about the sides of her cheeks would would glue then spill on that part of her face and then cause you know glue to be visible it doesn't make any sense people it's too stupid to be true so why do we believe it and then as african americans so many of us believe that we have to stand up for this woman and take her version without scrutinizing it that's why we keep getting screwed over into society because politicians tell us stuff yeah i know what's best for you and what do we do oh okay well you said you know what's best for me so okay i'm not gonna ask questions i'm not gonna scrutinize what is being told to me it's unacceptable guys we should not live our life believing whatever we're told or supporting people just because they look like us that's not how it works trust is earned trust and verify don't let people mislead you because there'll be people who look like you who mislead you the most because they have that inherent trust because they can relate to you this woman is most likely a fraud and when it comes out in a few weeks and a few months and possibly a few days i want you all to know that people like strategic eyes told you so and let's give credit to other folks too like lovely tea because whatever hate i'm getting is a fraction of the hate she's probably getting strategic out like

day 73 we're gonna harvest on the gorilla glue we got some color to come out of here with the cold temps at the end I pushed her pretty far into amber because they did stall out on me in the middle on week five and six so I let him go a little bit longer just to get some bulk the fate came out beautifully I imagine they're gonna be nice and smooth I got a little tiny bit of fox tailing with nah I don't know if it's Fox ten you might just be bud structure because gorilla Luke does kind of look like that it kind of has the fingers on the buds but yeah I'll do some harvesting and take some pictures", "WB7bGaZjdbI": "hey everybody dr. sketch here we're in the veg room today the big bedroom and I just wanted to show you these beans that I bought the other day but we're gonna start right here tonight cigar is the ten evil years if I can focus on it ten evil years these are rolled exclusively for San Jose cigars in San Jose California YUM that is an amazing cigar it's a barber Paul Toro if you like cigars at all you should order some of these call up San Jose cigars in San Jose and tell them you want their ten evil years they don't always have them because they sell out pretty quick but when they do get a couple of 10 times they're yummy all right anyways I bought some seeds the other day about five Gorilla Glue and I bought five goldleaf from Robert Kirkman's I love growing marijuana and as you can see if I can get it to focus all five of these gold leaf C's popped open these are the guerrilla glues and I got looks like four of them yeah that one is if I can focus on it there kind of see that one's popped open looks like we got four of them cracked and one still in the process and they're gonna go in these beer cups over here I've already got them labeled probably get them off freaking backwards but I just wanted to show you this that uh this the beans are good beans and they cracked right open they have a hundred percent germination guarantee and a hundred percent delivery guarantee so if that last bean doesn't crack open I will be able to get another one but it looks like it is cracking open at the end I can I can kind of see it maybe I think it'll pop open but anyways I just wanted to show you they're getting ready to go in these beer cups and they will pop out in a few days anyways thanks for watching sketch TV", "vgfXcAKyzjI": "what of you two left the odd coming back with another video right here just showing off two of my most structured plants the so called Girl Scout cookies right here and later on the gorilla glue number four if you're wondering why it looks like this why the plants so short why it's not growing straight up it's because I love stress trained it during veg there's the cleanup right there gotta shave the legs shout out to my boy Danny in Vegas the food is always showing love much love to you dog anyways this is that GSC LST low stress train lots of colas a lot of fatness this is an outdoor grow for all of you that are tuning in for the first time this is that outdoor grower quality out here in Los Angeles California Kersh capital of the world but anyways the structure right there is because of a child\u00eds net that I have and all the nodes while it was vegging it was tucking under the trellis basically there was a note in each little square you can see it in my older videos and they maintain this structure right here she's about probably a month away from being done I'm gonna start flushing these two specifically the gorilla glue number four probably in the first week of October third through the seventh I don't know we'll see what she tells us see right there look at how fat these colas are I'm amazed by this outdoor stuff I mean don't get me wrong there's a lot of more work and you have less control but look at how fat and long those colors get like the one to the left right there that [ __ ] is a monster it's almost as big as my fist and she goes all the way down to all the way down so you don't even have all her red hair yet both of them really don't they're barely starting to read and we'll see how it goes hopefully she gets a little bit fatter both of them but they're really really sticky they smell up outside and I'm just waiting for that harvest I want to show you guys the driveway because I'm curious too I know what I could pull in that tent in the background but outdoors a whole nother game but anyways hope you'll have a good day and much love to all my growers and smokers peace and God bless", "SU1hYt4PzV8": "[Music] everybody of watching so

coach is in the building aka the ross [ __ ] in the game somewhere proclaim you can call me the goat if you want to go chase uh chuck chase chuck is the x factor and then he's the the co-founder just how notice everyone's looking but we also have a another person here in the room today chasing what we got yeah we have we have a a great guy in the industry um he runs an amazing uh booty grow in town jonathan the glue guy on instagram gm of bond road cannabis hey everybody what's up john that's so much how enjoying the nice toasty day at the end of the day i've been in my car all day and leather seats so yeah feeling like i could definitely use a shower so have you been at the have you been at the girl today or uh yeah today today was one of those uh you know a lot of shaking hands and kissing babies kind of days um you know running around getting getting some future orders ready i was out of the growth this afternoon for a little bit um i don't spend i don't spend as much time as i wish i could at the grow because i'm busy doing you know all the management stuff for the company but uh yeah i enjoy going out there so that that um let's talk about the the grow a little bit right so it's uh it's a boutique grow you have some exciting strains in there i want to dive into all that but just give us an overview of of what's going on over there how it's kind of different than some of the other places here in town so the big thing i as i was referring to earlier i started in the marijuana industry i worked for caesar's entertainment before i was a pit boss at harris and when they filed for their bankruptcy back in 2015 they laid off a bunch of middle management and i was laid off with a severance package and my wife and i talked about it and financially were okay so i wanted to take a year off and figure out what i wanted to do with the rest of my life and then shortly after that i became a medical marijuana patient and card holder and then i went into a dispensary and spoke with the bud tender there royally hated the way that i was treated i walked out got in the car looked at my wife i said i know what i want to do so i got into the business um and as i watched it grow from medical and just a few grows and a couple dispensaries and expand to what it is now i realized there were a few key things that some people were missing so that's kind of what i went after so we'll i'm sure we'll get into the history part of what i do but essentially what makes us different is that we have a brand so we are the grower for gg strains in the state of nevada the exclusive grower of course everybody and their mom has a gg4 gorilla glue 4 and chances are there's probably people out there that grow a better one than i do um there's no shame in saying that four was widely you know released or what have not years ago after they won their first cannabis cup so we don't really grow gg4 we grow one which is sister glue that's a phenotype of gg4 we have gg5 which is one and four across get one plus four okay so you're really high um so we have yeah gg5 new glue which when we get that uh we're we're still working it because every genetic is different and has different needs so you know it's a lot trickier to to grow good cannabis or i'm sorry can i say wheat on the shelves yeah whatever you want i hate seeing marijuana dope [ __ ] yeah you can say whatever you want so yeah um uh gg5 or new glue and i'll tell you the story about that later is by far and above the best strain i've ever had it was so powerful and i have seen people who do nothing but dab rock and sweat from smoking the strain out of a bong so we haven't unfortunately gotten there yet but i think we're just about to turn the corner we also grow glucy which is across the uk cheese in gg4 we grow i do glue which is a cross of wedding cake and gg4 also we have purple glue right now in the market we have a little too much purple glue we got a little lopsided um purple glues across of las vegas purple kush and gg4 and we are working on uh the newest creation for gg strains as well as the last creation from josie whales that's glumens so it's gg4 across with animal mints um has a minty flavor on the exhale it's really good uh there are only five people on the planet that have tried it i'm one of those i loved it so we're working on getting her health up and getting her big and strong to get into a garden you can't just come up with a new strain and throw it in a you know large scale grow it won't survive it takes time you have to build up health so yeah those are what we grow and of course we still grow our bond road kush which is you know a wonderful strain it's actually bubba fett renamed but it is amazing it's a beast people love it i can't grow enough of it and then we also grow white 99 we call it bonded 99. we haven't grown it in a while but we're putting her back in the garden and giving her another run but the biggest difference what separates us is that we actually have a brand it's not just bond road it is the gorilla glue suite of strains the g strains so you know um trying to make a name for yourself in a market like vegas is hard enough uh so instead of trying to be the brand uh being anheuser-busch is okay with me too yeah and having you know a budweiser a you know well-known name yeah definitely and so i mean you kind of touched on it but you know you became a medical patient you said in 2014 2015 2015. um so when did you get into the camp center did you just dive in with bond road or did you start with somebody else no so um i started and i was hired in october of 2015 for a company called m hardine and they did consulting design cultivation hr all you know kind of a full service company so that if you had a lot of money and wanted to get into the to the wheat game but you had no idea what you're doing you would call a company like mr dean mrd so myself and a guy named garrett who works for me now we started actually he started first i started the day after but we started at the flora vega facility up on craig road and i worked there until i blew my knee out in july but i had been hired for my now position in june so you know you get hired for the big job and then three weeks later you blow out your knee and require two surgeries to get it fixed so we um we went ahead got it fixed and it took a long time to rehab and then emhardine had left las vegas and then the guys i was you know that i do work for decided to wait for a while before they started so i found myself right around christmas time in 2015 um it's just bored out of my mind and i actually took a job with mmj america as a bud tender and eventually a manager because i wanted to understand what that side of the business was like i wanted to talk to all the medical patients and stoners or both in some people like myself but i wanted to get as much market research as i could um you know so that when i got to this job i was better off for it so yeah so um you know taking over bond road right as general manager what's that i mean what's that day-to-day look like right like what what gives if so you can give someone an a perspective of what a general manager of a critique of cultivation is what would that be so all right um to give an idea when i first started so they called me in july who said we started last january it hasn't gone very well we need you to come on in be you know be our boots on the ground you know take over and get it to work right so when i came in i had a lot of unflushed product a lot of failed product over a couple hundred pounds and you know i worked as a grunt and a grow and a bud tender and a shift manager in a dispensary so really i was going in with a lot of lifelong management experience but really no training for what i was stepping into of course so my first probably nine months was spent just trying to figure out how to breathe up at four in bed at midnight and just stressing out trying to figure things out learn things on the fly constantly you know get acclimated with employees going through changes so after that it got to be okay so sorry apparently i'm on a casino table and then i think that when you when you tap the table it makes a lot of back noise on the mics so for everybody listening to my terms solo i apologize um so what's my day-to-day life like uh it's basically you know navigating the the everyday challenges that there are in cultivation no two days are alike every day has a new challenge you know there's so much to learn the laws and the rules and regulations are constantly changing you have to keep up with that um you know you you have all of your employees you know they're my main focus truth be told every day i i look at my job as is you know making sure that the 13 people that work for me have everything they need to do their job the best that they can and to make sure that their paychecks clear every other week and that they don't have to to worry about it um you know i always tell people that i think that the best leaders are nothing more than the best servants when when you're truly a good leader you're always honest you treat your employees with respect not with disdain you never use words like babysit or have to deal with um you know i i'm very appreciative of the 13 people that that work for me and the passion and dedication that they bring uh you know we don't have attendance problems we don't have people that bicker with each other uh these are all people who you know want to come in and do better every day and and they want to be one of the best at what we do so my job is just basically you know help help steering the the ship in that direction and and making sure that all those people have everything they need and then there's the other side of it too you know you have to be you know some you know i do have help with human resources but i do have to be hr sales marketing advertising accounts payable accounts receivable you know literally everything so you know there's different things and it's constant it's all the time you never stop there's no break throughout your day um so it's just you know it's basically remembering to breathe to keep things on pace and on track and to prevent anything from really you know falling apart yeah first yeah for catching up that's crazy man uh are you do you do all the sales too yeah yeah just quick question man that's crazy man um you know the last year us working you know with you know closely with the cultivations and seeing how that operation works and it's i mean there's just so many variables that go into it right and um i mean let's talk about just the flower storage right now in the market yeah i mean that alone has been crazy yeah i mean how is that it's wrong i don't everybody wants to buy weed but i just don't understand how there's a flower shortage right i mean i feel like obviously covet hit i couldn't sell it graham during cobra because all the stores shut down they weren't doing you know walk-ins it was delivery only for a while yeah so they went from you know like their business levels dropped between 60 and 70 percent yeah i mean i couldn't i couldn't give away my problem and then and then it was like end of april beginning of may where all of a sudden like the market kind of came back online and then it like the demand for cannabis just kind of blew past where it was initially and i don't know why that happened and i think maybe there's a possibility that you know uh when coveted hit a lot of cultivations like all right we're going to cut half our staff or 75 percent of our staff i know lots of cultivations that did this and um we lose any of them i mean i don't i don't i don't know honestly and i'm i think we'll probably find out here in the next six to twelve months because there's some people who's [ __ ] up their harvest schedule so bad that you know they're never gonna be able to come back and i think that's what's happening right is that people just didn't consistently keep going our cultivation that we're working with obviously did um and even with that i mean we're just every week selling out and it's just i mean it's hard even hard to keep up and i mean i talk with the buyers she's like well if you know anybody else besides you that has to be this let me know um so it's interesting you know i'm you know it might just be the way that it's the state's set up too you know what i mean because the market's always going to go through you know the ebbs and flows i just feel like you like let's just talk about like eight nine months ago abundance of flour in the market like more than enough flour like too much flour in the market now there's not so i don't know maybe maybe we want heavy on concrete maybe went heavy on edibles i'm not really sure what happened but i think a lot um i think well i think flower cells probably went up because i think during code but a lot of the the fancier products the concentrates and the the more for the product really buying those people buying up all the flour man and that's usually the cheapest thing that you can buy out of this country right it's a pre-roll you walk in spend you have 10 bucks in your hand you can usually get that approval you can get rpl for seven dollars at some place it's the cheapest you know the lowest gram in the store excellent plug yeah i want to talk about like you know you as a person like being able to just kind of manage all that stuff and it just man like you know we we tour cultivations you know every day that's what we do all we do is we go and talk to different cultivations you know we're buyers in the market and we're getting to know people and and you know there's there's a lot of crazy people out there there's a lot a lot of people not doing the best kind of business you know there's a lot of people that are really doing a phenomenal job right and you see license owners and holders you know really getting break breaking their backs what someone's like some would say but but i mean you you you seem to care about it so much you know and and it's really you have a cool story how you you know you started with your interaction with a bud tender right and then you know you you something happened inside of you so i want to talk about that what is that passion where does it come from why does it keep you so emotionally vested with with your work over there well i think you know part of it you know you know just starting out the conversation you know as we go through life at some point you learn that there's the person that you are and eventually it meets the person that you're supposed to be you know those of us that are successful generally will tell you something akin to i'm only successful because i [ __ ] up a whole bunch in my life so for me it was you know marijuana was that the one thing in my life that that helped it helped me become a better person it helped me realize that you know there are things about myself that i need to make better that i need to change it gave me a sense of empathy um you know i was not an empathetic person i you know i i grew up without parents really i you know it was just yeah you know life you know single dad who is always on the road traveling doing sales so you know i grew up a little isolated as a kid so you know which means i [ __ ] up a lot as a young adult and a teenager um and even as an older adult i mean you know as we go through we were constantly learning and you know as i call it gaining wisdom so for me you know i felt that i needed to give give back to marijuana also you know from working in the casino business uh for the 10 11 years that i did i never once came home feeling better about what i had done that day because i didn't do anything you don't create anything you know you don't you don't make people happy your first name is mother every day when you go home because they've lost their money yeah you've watched people lose you know until fortunes that go from being very comfortable for the rest of their lives to asking if you know you're hiring it's just a real negative atmosphere and it does not bring out the best in people marijuana however every day when i go to work i know that whatever me and my team do during that day will make at least one person's life better somewhere every day yeah um what other job in the world i mean maybe the medical profession or mental health you know but what else can average schmucks like us do that can really make a difference and really make people's lives better in one way shape or form no so you know that's where i really get my passion knowing that what i do every day makes makes a difference um you know and i'm a stoner too and i've smoked a lot of shitty weed in my life so you know i i am a las vegas you know las vegas are they're a very harsh group of people they're very judgmental we're spoiled we have the best of a lot of [ __ ] here and um you know i i want to look at these people and say you know what i'm giving you an honest product at a fair price and they say yeah you do um you know i want to have really great weed for las vegas that doesn't break the bank damn that dude their new line called the fresco line they have uh their fresh frozen live terps yeah uh that they put in their co2 machine it's pretty interesting i mean this the oil quality color is really really interesting i wish we could do fresh frozen but you guys have seen our facility we have room to farm yeah and so i was gonna you know i wanted to kind of touch on that i mean you know this cannabis industry i say this all the time there's you know rats snakes and vultures just literally everywhere right i mean it can be really a toxic place to be how do you stay so positive with this someone's like with so much toxicity around me i mean i mean you know i mean there's buyers who are just complete [ __ ] right and so it's tough for those deal those people but somehow you manage to stay positive and then also not man stay positive you also manage to sell them weed how does that work um well you know a big thing is is is you know i'm again i'm a small boutique grow for the most part we grow a really great product you know nobody bats without you know 100 percent or a thousand i guess what would be the better way to say it so you know we've grown some not so i mean we used to grow [ __ ] we man two years ago ah it was so awful and like who do you smoke like anybody about mine um no it wasn't that bad but um you know how do you stay positive what's the alternative i mean you know the one thing that's that's true about life when you get up every day and any situation that you face you have the innate ability to choose your attitude you really can't you could be having a [ __ ] day everything in your life could be going wrong i don't want to hit the table again everything could be going wrong but you can still choose to have a good attitude eventually when you when you do that enough it becomes a a good habit i mean i've always been you know somewhat of a jovial guy and if you talk to the people that work for me they will tell you that i'm not always upbeat and happy and bouncing around because you know again i told you all the jobs i do there's a lot of a lot of weight that that i carry on my shoulders and it's a lot of pressure it's tiring i haven't taken more than two days off and in a couple of years um you know but i stay positive because you know i've seen all the negative people the vultures and the snakes and their businesses for the most part suck that's true people don't like them they're failing they're running in the red they treat their employees like [ __ ] i mean look you're working with marijuana and i believe that there's a certain karmic influence when you you know when you're lucky enough to be given uh such a an awesome responsibility as in you know what we do every day it's not just a bunch of people growing weed it's we're cultivating yeah we're growing weed but you know this weed is going to go into a lot of people's bodies you know could go into our friends family you know we we don't want him getting sick uh you know we don't want him to to you know to to be consuming shitty marijuana because god knows there's plenty of it um you know and like i said we haven't always been great either uh but we're always you know like the kaizen model always you know always improving always getting better um but the staying positive part i mean i've i've seen all the negative people i've seen my whole life the negative people and they lead that way it just doesn't do any good so when you work with something like marijuana you know you have to treat your employees like you do your weed you have to nourish them you have to help them grow um you know you have to treat them the same way and if you don't treat your employees right and this goes out to every one of you with a [ __ ] license if you if you're not treating your employees right figure it out because until you do you are never never going to be truly successful you're if you're you're not going to have customers that love your brand you're not going to have because your employees are never going to be really happy i'm not saying everybody has to make 280 000 a year you know selling aids but take care of them pay them a living wage i mean if you don't you're just never going to be successful you've you've got to take care of people otherwise we won't take care of you yeah i believe that so sure i mean there's just principle just there's bigger laws that exist and govern over over us as people that that's bigger than the marijuana advertising guidelines and all that stuff and i think treating people with respect and uh you know as as you wish to be treated yourself you know is one of those big factors and i would definitely tend to agree with you and and that you brought up the the kaizen the the kaizon you know you know about that i i know i don't i was going to lie and say that i did but they want to come out of the loop i i think it's just [Laughter] i don't really know everything about it but it's a basic principle of like you said you know progress right a commitment to getting better right yeah to improve it constant improvement and you know i i love that how um you know vulnerable you're being and and you know honest and open that you're you're talking about this and i i think that just these types of conversations and the situations you're talking about with the passion of going to to work and it being a bit you know something bigger this is what really separates the cannabis industry from like the alcohol industry or any of the other industries because um you know the plant truly is special right and it's really impacting people in in an incredible way and to be able to be a part of you know what's happening is you know it's it's a good time to be alive you know what i mean and for people like you that really see that and it's important to him and it's it's it's it's it's a it's an honor right to be able to be around you and to know you and yeah i would say you know just uh we i think me and jc really appreciate you as a as a person in the industry right you know there's not many people like you who are just like honest and realistically a straight shooter i remember i remember the first time meeting you at the grove facility you just kind of told us how it was and i think you know me and jc were like kind of early on of getting into the licensing deal game and we just really appreciated that knowledge right and that kind of helped us really find a place that we could sell weed at so yeah um so thank you yeah you're welcome and thank you for the compliment you know we um one of my big things as far as running this company is i don't just have you know there's always a few but but i really work at creating true relationships fair relationships um and you know some of the people that have supported us and and have paid our light bill when we weren't that good you know i was always honest with them every step of the way we're changing this we're changing that there are a lot of people you could ask um ryan bondis from the dispensary he was buying i think he was the first person that i really sold stuff to and it was by no means you know it was definitely 49 a quarter level um and even now much improved we still get a badge every now and then again that this is a 49 a quarter the majority of it is not but even the best of the best they still have that issue um but you know ryan would be the first to tell you that i'm always eager to you know sure i know my weed's not great but let me show you what i'm doing to make it better yeah you know i put up three giant d hues and and we've changed this and that and our nutrient formulation and you know just all the things and i've always told everybody who buys our product every step of the way the changes that we're making and if our product isn't that great hey look i'm not going to ask you to pay 3 200 a pound for stuff that's not you know my boss may not like to hear that but the truth is is that if you're a purchaser from a dispensary and i throw a curveball by it and then your customers are all coming back saying what's this goat [ __ ] are we you know that's going to put a dent in our relationship of course um so you know all the people that i work with in the business and now of course five years in which makes me one of the original people yeah um you know my phone my phone book is pretty big now um and i still stay in touch with as many people as i can um and that doesn't mean to say i haven't you know i've got there was one person who helped me out in the beginning and i really [ __ ] up that relationship on my own that's probably the only regret that i have so far in the marijuana business because i mean you know he's a good guy doing good things and let's just say i heard something about my company that freaked me out so i you know i put my head down and i just kind of wanted to make sure you know i heard a rumor that our license was for sale and you know any agreements that i had that were handshake agreements i just put them to the side and you know um yeah so you know i that would have freaked anybody out but ever since that you know ever since that day i'd you know i'll never do that again yeah um you know losing that person as a friend and a regular contact and somebody i can talk to um that haunts me still so you know we're not always perfect but you know creating the relationships that's what this is really about marijuana is about relationships 100 i mean you know think about before it was legal you had a dude on a 10 speed or whatever right that's been called this beeper they cut you back from a pay phone bring over he'd sm you know smoke him out talk about your week a little bit you know that's why we called it a connect yeah a little shake yeah i think i i think i kind of miss those days sometimes too because i was just talking with jc about my uh my dealer and i only want to call him a dealer because that's like just like a shitty name that's that just a homie that would just hook me up right um we're talking about him up in reno and you know he was just yeah he's my connect he was someone and someone that i had met at 18 years old who kind of like uh nursed me through my cannabis years right from 18 to about 21 until i got into the industry and so um you know i miss that guy so shout out i'm not going to say it but shout out to dave man i miss you i miss you dave i hope everything's going well man so uh yeah i mean if more more guys that are in the industry now kept some of those principles right of of the old connect right you know what i mean like you said it right he's not the dealer right he's the homie he's the kinect right he's the guy that got you through and it's the same way today man with the buyers out there in the industry it's just like you said it's all about the relationship right it's all about just being honest and showing up and and and coming through when you say that you can 100 you know what i mean that's a big thing that's missing from this business is is reliability yeah um you know people will say oh yeah everything looks great they will call you by the end of the day uh you know to buy some off yeah and maybe that's a deal that you really need to go through and then they just ghost you and make no phone calls that that makes my head explode but you know it's not just between vendors it's between customers um sometimes this sucks because you know i've been married for 16 years i don't have any kids but my wife and i are our best friends you know with this job i don't get to spend as much time with her as i would like um you know when i when i get home if i get up at five in the morning and then today i'll end at like 6 30 7 o'clock tonight before i'm done and i get home i'll have dinner with my wife i'll talk to her for an hour and then i'll get on my phone and i'll get into social media so any direct message that comes through to bond road cannabis or on reddit or on facebook that's me you're interacting with not somebody that i pay 20 bucks an hour or whatever to answer stuff um you know and for the most part uh people really like that they like having those discussions having an insider the industry of course you always have that that [ __ ] keyboard warrior out there that tries to ruin your day or reputation but you know it's fun because when you see it with you know me you'll see you know 30 other people jump up because i think everybody knows that my intentions are good and yeah you know none of us are perfect but you know there's no reason why we can't try to be um or at least be the best version of ourselves that we can be um so yeah you know it's it's it's a matter of not only having the connections and really you know relationships with say between me and the dispensaries um or with other vendors like we're we're talking to other vendors right now to try to get a 710 line for bond road it won't be a big thing because we're a small grow but you know rather than just turn our trim into distillate three or four times a year you know it'd be nice to maybe get it out right away after we trim and and have it turn into some shadow or something like that for the 710 crowd so they can get in on the glue and it yields well and it's you know and they're they're good extraction strains so um you know having those kinds of relationships as well um you know yeah it's what it's all about um that's great a lot of people miss that though they they really do to them it's just i miss it it's always about business it's always about trying to [ __ ] that guy out of the extra nickel yeah you know i think everything can be fair there's there's a point in which the shops make money the cultivators the production people they make money and the customer pays a fair price for a decent product there's a point where that exists yeah we're too early in this game now and there's you know like my bosses they've got [ __ ] millions sunk into our grow they haven't never gotten a nickel back yet they sat a couple years dormant then we had to go through our growing pains we're still figuring [ __ ] out i mean you know everybody thinks that hey i got a license so it's 50 super models and hookers and 30 pounds a week and 20 pounds blow and we're on a 100 foot yacht no it's not like that at all guys dude like little cultivators like me playing making [ __ ] yeah it's more like we're in a minivan driving from vegas to arena i'll go go sell some weed and get some content and not just any minivan a minivan with the wood panel on the side and a doughnut for one of the wheels so it's it's a lot harder to make a buck in this in this business than anybody outside of it realizes yeah people really believe that people are getting rich off selling weird it's not that it's you're getting really people are getting rich off the buyout right it's like you know what people when when a license gets bought out and that brand has a good brand name that is when people get paid but anytime before that you're not getting paid me and jc are are uh in the middle of that right now right i mean we're in the middle of this growing process of you know we're not millionaires by any means but we're trying to grow a million dollar company so yeah that's what it comes down to yeah dude you know it's the kaizon the kaizon kaizen i'm gonna start using that now yeah let me go ahead man listen thanks for coming on really appreciate it i love you you know you represent one of the good guys and you know i love to be aligned with that and where can they find you on instagram and so on instagram we're at bond road cannabis and by the way if you ever want to know where bond road came from it's what tropicana avenue was called until 1958 so it's at old school vegas where they had connections with the customers that came in knew on a first name basis right correlation um so bond road cannabis on instagram um we do have a website we're currently retooling it it's you know bondroadcannabis.com i'm going to tell you don't go there now and you're going to go but it's terrible so we're gonna we're gonna redo it um we haven't had a chance to yet um so we have that and then um yeah i mean we're easy to get a hold of if you ever have any questions just shoot us a direct message and i will personally respond to you generally very quickly too i don't like to push things off so um and then you know pretty soon here once we kind of feel

brother i think that's that's it thank you guys for watching we'll see you guys next thursday [Music] peace come on you", "TibQe8MGv90": "today in this update is also brought to you by star dog Auto these are fast bud seeds and gorilla glue Auto Hulse about fast bud seeds they're doing great today they're getting fairly huge okay star dog Otto I'd say it's a pretty damn good strand like look at all those tops so she just got a water change and she's doing pretty good really damn good so I do have it thinned out a little bit there here nice white roots look at that look at that root mass that come down so at the bottom of these net pots I cut out about an inch and a half by inch and a half square hole at the bottom so those main roots can build up right there I'd rather have it be a big centerpiece right there so that is star dog Otto moved it over underneath the 192 just as of today so she's always been underneath the SP 250 s and along with Gorilla Glue here where the blue Otto and they're just doing fantastic so the gorilla glue at first I thought I was never gonna make it but she pulled through she definitely pulled through right here we have a couple of twins like that I don't know I don't know how to explain it but it's a dual headed dual headed branch right there that's pretty cool so yep this one also you know both um got water change here and finally got to move out that big plant that's been in the corner only to exchange it with another huge plant so it's been a while since I've done an update and there's I've just been freaking busier in hell with everything but today since some chopping down that last moby dick XXL auto I felt like I should make a video and give an update on everything so in this update we're gonna be covering a few new things that I I've been experiencing with the summer heat and also some tips and pointers to keeping your your reservoirs cool and keeping your water below 75 degrees so you're gonna better nutrient uptake at a lower level I'd say about 62 degrees in your your totes and in the summertime what I've been experiencing has been you know it's been getting up some days over 75 degrees in my tote the reason we don't want to get over 75 degrees is because it can cause problems to begin with get bud rot your roots can go bad all sorts of stuff like that so I kind of learnt a lesson because I know the remedy to keep your your reservoir cold but I never did it and fall times coming here in Alaska so I'm like well when summer comes again next year I'll do it but they're just still feel more hot days here where I live so I probably should get around to it but what you can do to keep your reservoirs cold it's free some bottled water freeze you know however many you think it's gonna take to keep your reservoir cool I think what these ones probably keep 10 gallons cooled probably two water bottles per she just let them freeze and then you know put those frozen water balls in your reservoirs it'll keep your temp down during the hot summer days and it'll keep your your roots you know super healthy to keep the plant cool it'll be happy and you won't experience any problems with heat issues mainly it's just your roots you don't want your roots getting bad so I did get a little bud rot in the moby-dick XXL but it wasn't substantial it was just a small amount and it was because I did not address the how hot is getting in remember reservoirs so that is a little tip for you guys growing in water to keep your your stuff cool I highly suggest it and don't fascinate like I I was doing I mean it was just busy with with other work and so kind of I've been dragging quite a bit dragging ass but these leaves are good both of them I've been filmed filmed them both twice in their life also been super cropped this one here didn't spread out as well but it did pretty good it's just the strain this one here I filmed it and there's I filmed it twice as well but I think and some of theirs and it just spread out like wildfire I kept the heights down with these two strings definitely there we're gonna be on the tall side where I read up so I've filmed them twice to keep the to keep the height down you know I want to keep that height down make that plant bushy that's that's usually my goal I don't like them too tall they get hard to manage and if you miss the window then you deal with you know a huge plant that's over four foot tall and might not fit in your ear space so stay on top of your FEMEN don't let your plants get too tall if you have a limited amount of space that one moby-dick did get away from me when I was that out out of town on a work trip for five days and in those five days it stretched so far that I probably should have just chopped off the top and topped it but lesson learned and I'm just gonna continue to keep growing these plants keep coming out here I must be doing something right I think just with growing everything is a process you know there's an order and what you do things and what you gotta do in between those days of doing stuff you know just your typical daily plant care of checking your pH you know even if you're feeling a little lazy just remember that a little bit of laziness will cost you quite a bit if your pH is out of range for certain hours it can't get its nutrients that the full blended entrance that means if it doesn't get that full blend it'll feed on something else too much or won't get enough and just be a little a little runt all right so what about wrapped up here with these ladies will the glue has been filmed and two times super cropped horse always will be super crop I souped crop them them to hell and now they're just in bug mode so we're gonna go ahead and little butt up and coming up next on the radar four strains I have a new list of strings I'm gonna go ahead and grow the cheese XXL Auto but also have green poison and Dutch passion lemons it'll so those will be coming up in my gross cheese is gonna come first cheese XXL and then from there I'm not sure what strength but today's Monday so by this Sunday I'd like to go ahead and you know plant the the cheese XXL so I'll start germinating here on Tuesday or Wednesday supply Sunday this should be in the blocks is we need to get the new starter plants gone so I think these two are gonna go quick alright so that is my update for now ladies and gentlemen I hope that you enjoyed it and it's been a little while since I've done my updates but well worth it well worth it so you got to see some my lovelies here this one here is flushed for a week my pump goes off every 45 minutes 24 hours a day so I did accidentally let her wanna run out of water once and she crisped up she dried up a little bit all sadist one this part to be done I wanted it to be out of mine out of my head so she's done and the other moby-dick XXL has been carrying out for a week and a half so I'm gonna let it keep gearing up and this one here we need to chop down get kind of separated and gonna get the fan blowing on for the next four to five days all righty that is my update for now ladies and gentlemen and I hope you have a good time growing your drawer

video on this madness look i must be drunk or something i must be goddamn drunk to believe that somebody else could possibly be caught doing some [ __ ] which that can't be true anyways because i don't drink so god bless america don't get it messed up though this isn't surprising i knew it was only a matter of time before somebody else wanted to become an attention seeker besides i've witnessed the same exact pattern for two decades now someone gains a lot of attention regardless of the reason and then others just follow along like those little fishes from finding nemo and why do i feel like this shit's gonna happen to me let's say if i ever do make it in this youtube platform as far as being well known by a community why do i feel like someone's gonna attempt to copy my style and then claim it to be theirs only to get my attention well whoever you are in the future good luck because you are most definitely gonna need all the dedication in the world to constantly put words on the screen like i do and with that being said i really do wish you the best but anyways am i reading this correctly another person put gorilla glue in a place it's not meant to go and was subsequently turned away from a hospital tick tocker avani reyes who has nearly 500 000 followers on the platform uploaded a tick tock about four days ago in which her hair seems to be covered in gorilla glue and i am glad that they mentioned this person's identification preference because i don't have time for the lgbtq xyz community getting on me for a misrepresentation so thank you for having that information provided for me but anyways regardless of your preference you steal a damn dummy for putting gorilla glue in your hair yeah i said it that's what i said that's what i said i can't be anything like a chameleon i'm one in a million get the [ __ ] out of here stop trying to spoil the audience your segment is coming up soon god damn but anyways can't imagine if i would ever stoop this low to gain this much attention unfortunately for me i have family members that watch my videos and i don't think they'd approve of this mindless behavior especially my mom and as a matter of fact she sent me a nice message in one of my previous videos son you are a waste of life you were an accident yep love you too mom anyways i've already done wasted enough of your time so without further ado let's go on ahead and check out this foolishness guys my hair will not come i'm going to the hospital right now i'm on my way to the emergency room guys i'm freaking out oh my god oh my god i just got inside the hospital and i'm waiting for one of the nurses to come they don't really know what to do they're they're confused they don't know my scalp is burning so i hope they figure something i just got out the hospital and they did nothing for me look at my hair this is what they told me to do you should apply either olive oil tea tree oil or coconut oil on your hair to attempt to remove the glue or you can your hair i just want to say thank you to everyone who donated to my gofundme i now have enough funds to get surgery and i will be flying out to la thank you guys so much and i raise enough money and i'm getting surgery yo looking at this from start to finish it just seems like this person is making a parody of what happened to the original person i mean just look there is no way inhale you risk doing this to your actual hair never mind i just checked your bio and found out you're in massachusetts now this person being in this state has nothing to do with the state in general i'm just pointing out the fact that this person is in america but whatever this is the thing i don't understand you already have a big following as it is so why must you stoop so low into doing something stupid like this you must think you have swag or something and if that's the case you want to know what i have to say about your swag neighbor rip the swag off before i rip the tag off why my pants sag off cause i'm wrapping my ass off blows so ugly money so handsome this the [ __ ] anthem get it the [ __ ] anthem early in the morning [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] look all jokes aside i'm done with this [ __ ] i refuse to talk about another dumb ass person putting gorilla glue in their hair and that's just the bottom [ __ ] line point blank period but that's all i really have to say about this video thank you all for watching and god bless america shut the [ __ ] up [Music] you", "pVEDAFXP9bg": "hey guys how's it going real good bud here here with my Canuck puck and i'm about to start popping some seeds so I bought this connect puck here from Canucks seeds and let me just get it open here sorry it's hard to record and do stuff at the same time I haven't got that good yet but Terry's my connect puck as you can see and then I bought this one see there's gorilla glue number four or feminised cheese feminised Jack Herer feminised and that's what I bought this one for was a jack hair so I'm excited to pop those seeds and start crawling me some jack hair I think I might do two strings so Jack here cushy cushy feminised and now we're back back to the gorilla glue saying open this up to connect puck I'm going to open this up drop them in some water she let him dance sit in there for about a day after they've been in about a day they get nice and swell swollen up and we'll throw them in some paper towel with just a little bit of damp water to let the roots the roots spread out so just give me a minute and I'm gonna open this package up and I'll show you guys what that looks like but I'm gonna have to stop and show you guys be right back so here it is with the label peeled off and you can see the little tiny containers stuck into the sides of them still not too sheer on how to get a meal but I will have to pull this that stop the video and try to get these guys there see I still got them labeled there that's good so I'm gonna pull out the jack hair and maybe some cushy cash but we'll see I forget how many scenes coming each one so I'll be back ok so with that amount and the little containers are actually labeled which is good and there's three seeds in each one I've got the Jack here where the glue cheese cushy cush I'm gonna take one seed usually I like to do two by and do one seed try to save it I'm gonna do one Jack hair and still undecided of which one I'm going to the other one but I'm gonna take one seed and drop them into this water here and that will be it for now then we'll wait be patient and reap what we sow alright thanks guys I will get back to you on this so we got our Jack hair and we got our gorilla glue number four I guess that's important there they are hopefully they will turn into you some nice thriving plants pretty soon we'll get one and I don't know if they will take a bunch of clones from these little babies stay tuned", "GbEhPdTU0dY": "yay i get to talk about the same woman again as if the first time wasn't bad enough really when i made that first video i had lack of information provided for me first of all i didn't know your ass was 40 years old would you look good for your age by the way i only said it like that because you just so happen to look younger than what you seen however now that i know that you've been on this earth longer than me times two i was gonna say that my sympathy for you decreased but i don't think age should define someone's iq so i'll give you the benefit of the doubt however as soon as i found out what you did after my last video about you i lost all of what little sympathy you had from me so ladies and gentlemen here's what happened the gorilla glue company issued a public apology and to sum it up they pretty much said sorry you dumb [ __ ] we supplied you with the warning label and everything but since we're a company we have to keep it professional and keep our true feelings to ourselves then afterwards she posted this picture on her instagram of her getting treatment at the er she spent about 20 plus hours there only to find out that in the end the product had burnt her scalp so the recovery process was damn near impossible so then afterwards she was instructed to keep trying the potential remedy that they supplied her while she was home but come to find out that didn't work neither so then next on february 8th she made a gofundme page which raised over 13 thousand dollars in one day but the final thing that she's either decided or is thinking about doing is suing the gorilla company in itself man i really don't care i'm doubling down on how i felt last time and y'all might hate me for what i'm about to say but just like my voting poll in my last video i just don't give a damn this updated situation just feels like she's just trying to profit off of being stupid like even her gofundme didn't have a description as to why she was requesting for fifteen hundred dollars now i'm not mad about it i mean if random people you don't even know want to reward you for your stupidity then that's cool but you ain't gonna catch me doing no [ __ ] like that because i'm just looking at this for how it is yeah it sucks that you made this mistake but i'm not gonna reward no one for being a damn dummy and like i said i don't care how y'all feel about that and so now another thing i want to say is that people are now turning this into an anti-black woman hating thing and if y'all watched my last video on the girl that said the n-word y'all should know by now that i'm not a fan of pointing out someone's race in these types of situations like are you serious whoever typed this news article needs to get slapped this situation has nothing to do with dehumanizing black women race and gender aside this is just a stupid ass person we're all trying to make our own assumptions as to why this woman decided that it was a good idea to put gorilla glue in her hair and the most common assumption is that she just didn't read the label because if you just take the time out and read what is on it you would come to the realization that this is not hair spray oh my lord lady you cannot tell me that you read this and genuinely thought that this was hairspray i don't believe it i refuse to believe it i'd rather believe that i can beat xcom 2 on legendary difficulty than to believe this [ __ ] and what's crazy is i even have my own assumption that she could be illiterate but come to find out that can't be true because she's a teacher so based upon the information that has been provided she has to have some type of intelligence here but anyways just look at what this person typed in this article just look at this many of us tortured our hair into compliance because we were tired of being called quote unquote nappy-headed especially by folks who look like us we endured the jokes and laughter of those who thought calling us quote-unquote bald-headed was funny and who can forget the knights we cried because we weren't the ones born with quote unquote good hair like what this has nothing to do with the struggles of black woman and their issues with being socially accepted in society and i'm not saying there's no one looking at this and saying oh lookie over here we have another case of a black woman doing black things if somebody is genuinely out there saying that then you're an [ __ ] but the vast majority of people realize that this has nothing to do with race however something that this does have to do with though is a message from one of my friends and after hearing what i said last time about me being proud of her and stuff my friend she wasn't amused at all in fact she ended up telling me something important and that important detail was that she said i heard you got a main chick a mistress is somehow you be up to no good in everybody now my own girls tried to warn me they try to let me know what you got i need a lot so i can't let you guys she said i can't get enough can't get enough uh i need that i can't get enough can't get enough uh i need that i can't get enough of what you got good guys you hit the spot tryna let go but i just cannot so don't you stop i need that anyways all jokes aside this woman is just taking it way too far as far as her attempting to sue a company for her stupidity but like i said before y'all can agree or disagree with all of what i just said but in the end i really just don't care and that's just the bottom [ __ ] line point blank period but that's all i really have to say about this video thank you all for watching and god bless america shut the [ __ ] up [Music]", "GoFJgnnsyHM": "about a month now it's not by choice no it's not by choice ladies and gentlemen this is actually happening right now plastic surgeon offers to help women who use gorilla glue on hair as lawyer accuses company racism if you don't know what's been happening over the past couple days this lady over here tesco brown she posted this video that's been getting a lot of traction on the internet especially on twitter and you would notice in the video that her hair is a little bit different than what a lot of people would uh would normally style it's a lot more glossy you you would think and while i was watching the video i was like oh she has she probably put some some interesting uh hair hair cream or i don't know what what women use on their hair as hair products but jesus christ she would use gorilla glue she used girl who she sprayed her hair with gorilla glue now if you don't know gorilla glue isn't meant for your hair is glue okay it is for it isn't an adhesive for objects and things that do not pertain to the human body this lady who has literally the chrome dome all right who has a wave check that's a it's per a permanent wave check on her head right she's accusing the gorilla glue company of causing this to her when in reality she literally spray painted her hair with this that's like saying that i took i took a blow dryer right and i'm i'm in the bathroom and i i dropped the blow dryer into the into the into the bath water and electrocutes me and i'm gonna blame it on the people that manufactured the hair dryer it's not my fault it's the company's fault that gave me this product and it was faulty for whatever use it was well first off you're not supposed to you're not using the product as it was intended you made a decision to put jesus christ like glue gloss on your on your head like jesus you look like a chrome dome looking ass you go yell and now you're accusing the company of racism i'm just going to read a little bit for from this uh from this article here a black woman who okay this is a base star a black woman who glued her hair solid with gorilla glue will reportedly fly to la where a renowned plastic surgeon has offered to unstick her the internet debate on her curious hairdo soon devolved into accusations of racism oh boy yes it's getting spicy tesco brown became internet famous last week when she posted a video on tiktok seeking help for a sticky situation the 40 year old louisiana woman encased her hair in grill glue spray adhesive and spent a month unable to remove the high strength glue from her head now ladies and gentlemen this is where it gets spicy okay though guerrilla glue is not sold in the beauty aisle brown apparently felt misled telling her tic toc followers that she usually use shorts cops got to be glued to finish off her hairdo and assume girl google works similarly jesus christ what is wrong with people nowadays and you know what's even more interesting about this whole entire situation is um there are people siding with this lady i can't believe this people are citing racism for this gluing your hair together with freaking goose spray jesus christ so many are being dismissive of a girl girl given the history of how black women are targeted and still bow the persuasive belief that our natural hair is unprofessional encounter in some way as statement we show her some grace and understanding the act of racism in misogyneer is forcing his woman to live up to the european standard of beauty so she has to use gorilla glue what the hell wait um i'll be honest i don't know why people do this on the internet comment description how you think about the situation this is doc on the radio i'll see you guys in the next video peace you", "iKpMtrStW-I": "got one in here killer how you doing what's up hillbilly good see three back to my usual Sunday program or whatever you want to call it hmm laughs you owe this five listen here

guys already know I'm more of an English I'm more of a sativa guy no no fart story it's not it's not a fart story I'm worth sativa guy and when I went to the store they had the gorilla glue for and this the bugs on this was this I know it's an indica but it was just straight-up cheap [ __ ] good to pass on I mean you want to talk about some sugary [ __ ] flower I mean just shake it out you know [ __ ] dreaming with trichomes and all that good [ __ ] you know so I couldn't pass that up and I I didn't want to buy a whole lot cuz I didn't have that much money although thank God to the the the compassionate program that I'm enrolled in that NOAA and getting huge great discounts you know what would have cost me over 50 bucks or close to 60 bucks basically cost me $14 for an 8 for an eight to that 14 bucks of they get really glue okay this particular gorilla glue is 24% DC by the way yeah I know right [ __ ] killer prices right and like I said you know he hit him with the sales you know you hit him with the [ __ ] deals that's the one thing about knowing that's good you can do is you can hit them with the sale prices you know but the always offering discounts in this and that but 14 bucks for a eighth of some killer ass [ __ ] gorilla glue I got the receipt right here to prove it you know you can see right down there if you like ready change 85 bucks or something like that you know what they didn't have too much in the way of cartridges at least not in the way I wanted so I didn't grab any cartridges but next time I go to the Cure I'll make sure to grab a few because I don't have any more cartridges once I run out of what I got so far that's it so this this start off with the gorilla glue by doing a smell test and visual tests show you guys exactly what I paid $14 for smelling it oh man it smells so [ __ ] good [ __ ] boldly bold smelling the buzzer I wouldn't say they're small but they're not the biggest I've ever seen I've already started to chop it on this one and here you go I don't know if you can see the trichomes I hope you could hope you can actually but [ __ ] ha amazing amazing that's all I'm gonna say ok nor has got this [ __ ] together now when it comes to growing the flower and curing it oh let's see I have a joint rolled here or a cone free road and the usual test five halftime assessment and then another five for the final assessment so I don't know if what you guys are smoking but whatever you're smoking you might want to load it up roll it up cuz I'm about to light it up and let's have a big smoke out right now because I was really wanting to get this done and give this a shot I see some of you guys I know exactly what you're smoking already but anyway ah no one there there are there are to their dispenser that has two locations they have one location on Yonge Street in town and they have another location in Kaneohe so it's the one dispensary that's the closest to me you know cure cures a little further away but no no you know because they have two locations they are closer to me now however it could be closer it'd be nice if it was even closer than that but we'll see what happens I'm hoping the Cure open something in my area and that'll be great so we'll see what happens alright guys here we go cheery old guys Lucky Charms mmm that sounds that sounds interesting and intriguing we have to be lucky charms why could

is to it [Music] I I can tell you right now sleeping it helps immensely in fact every time I've smoked this I would I went to bed like [ __ ] I fell asleep shortly after so probably a sure thing that once this part once they start livestream is over you know I'll probably be taking a nap at some point you know yeah I thought man gives you the couch luck something fierce you know it's good though I mean it's it's also a it's such a heavy hitter though I really wouldn't uh give it to the novice smoker this is for somebody who's who's familiar with smoking cannabis you know this is not for your first-timer okay honestly this will make them just pass out and go to sleep ain't gonna really enjoy this one because they won't be around to enjoy this one uh what's the temperature in Hawaii right now right now I would say it's about at 82 you know yeah smoke away you can't where you plan to sleep at you know but yeah it really knocks you down man I mean this just just takes you down to another level okay right now it's not that hot actually be honest with you after being through a couple of weeks of 90 91 92 degree weather with some heavy heavy gimme that was that was [ __ ] killer that made you that made you [ __ ] are you doing Bon Jovi that made you [ __ ] wanna die God you know but this this this one really [ __ ] I'm losing my train of thought guys losing what that's how good

mean this stuff really helps as far as relaxation is concerned it really it really wipes out your [ __ ] you know you this is not something you want to go to the bank run errands and this and that you know that's really one of them you just want to close your eye a little bit you know maybe watch some [ __ ] Avengers or something you know I thought Jesse and get through it that way you know what I'm saying so it is what it is I mean it's a good strain you know the good strain this is a good specimen of the strain it does not give you munchies any time I ever smoked it I don't have the munchies never did okay which is cool lord knows I don't need help in that area but you know it doesn't give you the munchies but it gives you cottonmouth like you wouldn't believe and I think I said that about cottonmouth at least four times already in this video man black Afghan wow that sounds like a [ __ ] heavy heavy indica as well [Music] that being said let's go ahead and finish off this next five years here and get a full assessment right now I would say I'm at a I marry number six six and a half but I'll be pushing it so I you know be be strict about it and just say six let's just call it a six after five okay now this is an indica broom oh that one that you mentioned is a sativa the black Afghani oil that's a sativa really hmm all right using your Afghans role either cuz

there and you know cuz there was up to my monthly infusion of the anti-rejection medicine that music takes about two hours to go through and whatnot so I'm y'all gonna be there for a little while and the nurse sucks up the IV and whatnot and the doctor before I see you know before I went you know the look before the nurse got ahold of me the doctor tells me oh you know what he you got a lot of fluid in you you know so he was concerned about the fluid that was building up in this and that so he basically gave me a diuretic in the IV you know in the syringe to make me get rid of that fluid and oh I got rid of it all right I started peeing like you wouldn't believe like 20 minutes after you know just [ __ ] pissing like a racehorse and [Music] everything was fine you know everything went well I had a good [ __ ] pee right before I left his office then I went outside waiting for my boss boss was taking a little wrong and he was doing some traffic because it was on the Friday and so I took awhile to get home you know anyway the bus [ __ ] starts to empty out right you know it starts emptying out and I'm going home and I'm getting closer and closer to home but this [ __ ] but I got a piss bad you know what I mean I got a goal like [ __ ] you wouldn't believe okay I mean I know you guys had that feeling before you know where you just got a [ __ ] like you got a go so [ __ ] bad that it's like a bladder is about to burst you know and abandoned I didn't want to get off the bus dude because the next one would come in 45 minutes and I was not cool dad you know so you know [ __ ] dad I wasn't about to get off but there was like Oney what the end it was only like myself my wife and we were in the we were sitting in the back you know in the back of the bus and there was one woman passenger in the front and the driver and I have a a I have a I had a bottle you know a kind of big juice bottle that I drank and dude I hacked you bro I happy man I pulled my shorts to the side and brought out my [ __ ] dick stuck the head in the pocket in the opening and just [ __ ] let it flow you know and oh man it felt so [ __ ] good and what can I say me it I just kept Pina Pina Pina you know what I I felt I felt the liquid in the bottle and it started coming to the top and I said to myself oh [ __ ] you know what okay that's enough peeing I took it out tucked my [ __ ] back in up my shorts and [ __ ] capped it real quick and just [ __ ] put it on the side you know put it on the side and [ __ ] hidden just I'm a didn't leave it there at least I didn't leave it there I could I would be [ __ ] uncool to leave it there in the bus that would be that not cool okay I did take it off the bus and I went to the nearest trash can and I just threw it away so some insight somebody's trash can was [ __ ] Primo's [ __ ] pee and a lot of it I had to go I don't know Dumb and Dumber I have never seen the bit on that I have never seen it but I had to go man I couldn't [ __ ] hold it that was some crazy because you know what I tell you honestly I was just too far away from home I was just too far away from home to wake if I could hold it and wait I would just waited until I got home and made a mad dash to the bathroom but the truth be told I was just too far from home to hold it that long and because of that I mean I just it was either it would either piss myself or [ __ ] piss in the bottle the bottom line this [ __ ] was better it was coming you know what I mean it was coming so something was the bounty something was gonna give that's all it was to it you know so [ __ ] man I just [ __ ] let it go you know dude I you know right now I'm doing okay pastor I'm doing all right I had to go for a wee checkup second time and they did one they did one screening two weeks ago then they asked me to come back for a second screening they wanted to make sure I don't know what the [ __ ] that's about but whatever I went back and that's when this all happened and that happened on Friday Anke brother so I'm hoping that I'm still doing okay the women and children first I'll tell you what man times like that Primo's first [ __ ] me and I am you know what I mean oh man foot hands for themselves you know [ __ ] mana man it was one of them orange juice containers you know you know what I'm talking about them orange juice containers that hold about a liter you know man I filled that [ __ ] up almost almost 3/4 way to the top okay so I mean that's some heavy peeing right there you know Fanta it's fat the yellow I don't know I never drank it before man I never drank Fantas I would not know what color Fanta is what is that like a mountain do you color is that what it is I don't know honestly all they have many oh really so are you saying that they got all kinds of different flavors lemon fantasy I'll castle look that answers my [ __ ] question right there they got all kinds of different flavors though all right there you go hey I never know dude I never knew that about Fanta I've never drank it you know cool learn something every day wow man you know what I think I think about seven eight hits right now and I'm I'm [ __ ] like [Music] also this bug just [ __ ] burns nice - doesn't run so it's not over dried and it just burns nicely can you hear the rain can you hear the rain on my porch I don't know if you can hear it kind of loud dude oh yeah and well I'm gonna take one more hit and then we're gonna call that ten already I'm starting to talk a little funny and I don't know and just I my memory is like totally gone right now [Music] I want another hit stop dammit one more and you should see that that day on the bus there was one guy carrying a chicken Walker had chicken in his hand where to chive that you don't have a chicken in his hands carrying a chicken man that's what happens when you take a bus to the country dude [ __ ] you know it's uh he's you see [ __ ] like that you know [ __ ] guy come carrying a chicken on on the bus [ __ ] crazy [Music] where was he going I have no idea but there he was carrying a chicken Oh hmm Wow I tell you what guys for 14 bucks the 14 dogs that I spent for this gorilla glue number for this is 1/8 by the way right there 3.5 grams and a to that 14 bucks man you can't go wrong I mean this shit's like a man some carry chicken some piss in a bottle you got that right [ __ ] a I don't know did they really did GG number four I I don't know bro I really don't know I'm not sure that you know that I'm not sure yeah well you know the reason the price is so good was because you know the army cost me 60 bucks you know it would normally cost me 60 bucks but because I have I'm a member of the compassionate program I get one purchase fifty fifty dollars off and plus my usual ten percent off discount okay so that was and that I can do that once a month you know what I mean every month I got one purchase that do you like that so you know it was like getting late in the month you know and I figured you know what I might as well go down there and get what I can and but I being you know you know they had dad and I was planning on getting the sativa I was gonna come home with a j1 or he's something to that affair you know which is such a Teva but when I seen what the [ __ ] gorilla glue look like and I I knew I mean it wasn't an indica I know it's an indica well when I seen it you know on the shelf in the bottle you know and you see it it's all [ __ ] didn't like sugary you know and I asked the guy let me know if you can check it out and I check it out and oh man I mean it was like I just have to get me some you know I just had to it was just no question about it just some things in life that you got to do you know that was one of them and then when I rang it up you know when I when I took it to the register and rang it up and that's when they applied the $50 off and I ten percent off and because of all that it came down to $14 dude you know what they got their own discounts you know the one thing about Noah the one thing about Noah botanicals is no one has that program not everybody can get it though you gotta be gotta be older you gotta you know you can't be really young you got a got qualified for it okay medical condition no I kind of [ __ ] and what you called but they do have other programs you know there that's just one of the program one of the best programs they got but they have other programs too like the loyalty program if you go there alive you know they'll hook you up with some major discounts and then they'll and then they always send you texts every [ __ ] day you'll get a text from you know one ounce for 150 bucks of this this this you know I mean I think right now they got this eight they call it an 8:00 flight deal when you pick a mix a mixed batch of four different aids of flour and you pay a flat rate of like 150 or something like that or something I forget what it is but the bottom line is it's a [ __ ] super deal you know and [Music] they have another you know discount where they you just give you like push like so much percent off for this day so many percent off for the next day you know what not it's they're really good with them with the with the of discounts guys double tell you right now I'm I'm definitely at a nine and a half nine and three-quarter feel right now I really have a heavy heavy indica effect going on right now and that's just making my eyes one of those clothes you know and [Music] this I mean it's what can I say man this this particular this is the [ __ ] right here you know it's the real McCoy the other dispensaries have their own different recall deals that they you know that they offer well no harm man there go the yarn your arms again but you know you know it's just really exceptionally good with that when it comes to add so it is what it is you know the thing about no one like I always say did be going to know panic oops catch them when Diggs they got a seal born you know get them right wetting it hot you know and that's that's hot that's the best way to pick them up oh my god dude I tell you what guys I'm gonna [ __ ] go ahead and have me a sandwich and go to sleep actually you know what I might just skip the sandwich and disco straight to sleep because I am feeling you know what now I'm feeling the creeper effect of thee will agree you know I'm feeling that creeper effect this definitely passed the test and I'm not an indica guy I'm not an indica guy but if you have the chance if you had the chance [ __ ] definitely give it a try okay I'm sure they test if that's what it is that you'll be just you'll be really satisfied okay alright that's about all I got for you guys you've hit that our mark here which means Primo's [ __ ] overdone his stay here so the

just won't show up so you got to like the video now before we start off the video i just want to say hi welcome to the channel my name's dino and uh if you're new consider dropping sub you don't have to if you don't enjoy the content but if you do why don't you you know drop so that all being said let's get to the video now what if i told you guys that people are trying to cancel the company guerrilla yeah you may be thinking dino is that even possible can people even cancel you know a company well i don't know if you can really you know cancel a company but they sure are trying to cancel it now if you live under a rock and you for some reason don't know what gorilla glue is the name kind of explains it itself but it's really good glue i can't really you know explain what gorilla glue is because it's kind of obvious like it's it's [ __ ] glue but you guys want to know so why why did gorilla glue get cancelled why are people trying to you know cancel the oh famous company gorilla glue it's because of this woman right here yes this woman started the reason why gorilla glue was getting canceled or is getting cancer now i'm sure you guys all want to know who is the old famous woman that you know god can't that got like gorilla glue cancelled and uh you know did some dumb [ __ ] with gorilla glue now her name is tessica brown and you are probably also wondering so what did jessica brown do to you know get gorilla glue in like this whole situation now it's the story she was trying to you know run out to start her normal day but she didn't have any hairspray so she decided you know what since i'm an idiot and i don't have any hairspray i'm gonna use some spray-on adhesive gorilla glue instead you know real big genius big brained woman right here she couldn't get it out so you know she went to social media because she couldn't find any answers on how to you know get it out of her hair instead because the internet is just a bunch of [ __ ] instead of you know actually getting help for this instead she became a meme nice one internet you guys are lovely people here's a golden medal but not all people you know became a meme and a lot of people are mad that people were you know memeing her so instead of being reasonable people and trying to help instead they went after gorilla i'm not even gonna just talk about her being a big brained woman looks like the whole internet is full of big brained people lots of [ __ ] einsteins roaming this planet but you may be wondering so dino how are people you know canceling gorilla glue how are people you know trying to cancel gorilla glue and lots of people are trying to you know agree that they should you know have a lawsuit again and people are trying to you know get their whole company taken down i don't really know if you can consider that cancelled but it or at least counts as you know trying now luckily this was only a few people and the whole internet is not full of you know smoothbridge but that doesn't change the fact that people were still trying to cancel gorilla glue over something that they didn't have any controls and you may be wondering so dino is is she okay is she gonna be all right and yeah she is actually getting surgery for it and i'm pretty sure it was success don't mark my word though because i have no idea how the surgery went and that doesn't change the fact that she's trying to you know have a lawsuit against [ __ ] gorilla glue over something that they can't really you know control it's really sad to see how stupid some people can be but that's just how society and people have evolved to a point where we're trying to cancel and sue gorilla glue over something that they cannot control at all but that all being said i'm gonna end the video up here so

today's video we'll be going over week number seven of the OTO flowers from growers choice seeds we're gonna start up in the nutrients on these girls and getting them started on a heavier feeding schedule daenam 43 of the Gorilla Glue Auto flowers these girls are looking good the topsoil was a little dry today so I watered each pot with two gallons of pH water starting off let's go to our little girl here in the ten gallon crock pot she's still looking pretty good and her flower is actually starting to put on a little bit of weight it's about two fingers thick at the moment hopefully it'll pump up a little more moving on to our big girl here in the 10 gallon cloth pot her bottom nodes are really starting to pack on a little bit of weight and that top cola is really starting to come out great I'm really got high hopes for this plant I'm pretty sure she's gonna be the highest yield err out of the three [Music] moving on to the lady here in the five gallon plastic pot she's looking great too long and lengthy their top cola is really starting to pack on some weight also the bottom loads are starting to plump up too just not to the level of the girl in the 10 gallon cloth pot all three of these ladies are kicking off some awesome odors though it's a sweet spicy smell and it's got me really excited for the final product of this plant here we are on date number 46 with the gorilla glue Otto flowers and they are looking fantastic took some more nighttime shot just because I feel like you can really see the plants better there's not so much light polluting and it's like the way it comes out this is the girl in the five gallon plastic pot here you can really see how many bottom nodes she's got hopefully these will all turn into some decent-sized buds it could do some more like defoliation on these plants but I'm kind of gonna let them go for a little while trim off any dead or damaged leaves here a little bit later here's the girl at our 10 gallon cloth pot you can see our bottom nodes and that little bit of low stress training are a lot bigger than the girl in the plastic pot and look at the size and the weight of that top cola she is beautiful I love how white the nugs are on these plants the flowers are really gonna be beautiful here in the next couple weeks when they get going [Music] moving on to our little girl here in the ten gallon crock pot for such a small plant she's kicking off some big odors she smells so good and I can't wait to harvest this little thing date number 47 and we're gonna be up in these girls nutrients today getting them started on a heavier feeding cycle will be giving them three tablespoons of our roots organics boo to grow and Buddha Bloom formulas per gallon will be watering two gallons for each cloth pot one gallon for each plastic pot [Music] here we are on day number 49 with the gorilla glue these girls are moving right along I love how fat their buds are starting to get and the smell they are kicking off in my garden in the interest of not repeating myself too much during this video I'm just gonna let the video do the talking in this last part [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

up so we'll see what happens plant also it's not growing the best in our environment you can see you have multiple grooves coming through right here and well it's really funny to about this grow is that the client the the grower was was the guy that shot did it provide us the clones they're like are you sure you want Gorilla Glue 300 of them you know like everyone wants to strain and I never grown the train before and from past experience I never pick a new strain to grow a large amount on this is the exact reason why is because you don't know how it's going to grow you don't know that the end result I mean you don't know how many leaves versus bud how hard it's going to be a trim you know some plants are just a [ __ ] to clean and trim and and there's a number of reasons and just I just wanted to point this out you know and these are those types of little mistakes are the reasons that are can be avoided when you have a grow coach or a master grower and your hands that you've hired like us to help help you make the wise decision sort of say are you sure you want to do this you know we did this last time it didn't work out for us yada yada so just checking out what's going

this one is a flower it's from nug no it's i guess cool i'm not sure but um i'm going to try it out uh see look at me i'm going straight into weed and i shouldn't really be into weed or anything i mean i'm trying to quit yeah i i do i lined it up i'm trying to make it look like decent you know i'm just i don't know first mustache all that other good stuff um so this one is a flower it's not it's balanced i kind of wanted something like extreme like it's going to make you really really but then i went there and then i started looking at the menu and i just got all mixed up with it so um i was trying to test uh to see how how like um how extreme i can get with weed like sativa is it really a sativa let's see if it let's see if it really sativa's the hell out of my mind you know or a indica where i could just smoke and just be like oh i'm in the couch you know that kind of thing but um lately all i've been doing is smoking weed that is hybrid and uh it's it's uh indica and usually the same effects have happened i mean that's what i'm saying about weed is like most generally um it seems to be the same kind of uh even and balanced type of uh high or or euphoric feeling whereas some people are sensitive to it where they just lie flat out uh when they're just um when they're done smoking or something kind of like me a little bit well i'm gonna i'm gonna check this out i don't

I am Fred and today i bring you another example of Gorilla Glue the first one coming I believe from i believe it was DC collective um but uh in flour form could have been kelly amaral club i believe it's DC collective but i know i had the left coast extract so Gorilla Glue number four in chatter form from DC collective on live show previously too so but this one this time this gorilla glue comes from skunk masters and oh it's just so delicious smelling you just get like kind of like a lemony kind of skunky ah tammy salary smell I mean it's just it's just really nice um you can see here it's got a nice dark green color to it but the frost on it makes it kind of look like a light like a lime green color um it's got some beautiful uh RIT looks like red hairs to me from here could be orange but to me it looks red right now and the smell like I said just very chemie and sour and you know just kind of skunky ish and it's gotten when you touch it I mean it's got a nice little bit of a stick to it I mean it's not like you know gloopy and you know it's not you know you're not gonna be able to exactly keep it stuck to your hand but um yeah has its own nice little stick to it and the gorilla glue is a crust of chem sister sour dub startup and chocolate diesel and it's taken first place at the 2014 High Times Cannabis Cup but I don't know why I just closed this because I actually do need to break a little bit more of it down actually I think I'm just gonna go ahead and break this nice little tiny bit down not much just enough to make a little bit of a bowl here this you know I don't like to get too carried away with things you know how to get it make things last a little bit that's why you never see me take real big huge bowls you know but then we go we've got a nice little bit ground up but I do have another little Bowl here packed and ready go so cheers everyone that was just nice and again very chemie salary and just got that nice little Kenny taste oh I don't know it's just delicious I love it this is a strain that uh it has a quick onset goes into your starts in the head and then goes down your body and done goes up from there you mean it gets really creative um and everything as it hits the head you get really creative um things just kind of pick up a little bit so you know it's got that you for yet to it and it just makes everything just much interesting and makes things look brighter so very good if you're not really having that great of a day um but on the other hand if you're by yourself it it does kind of tend to make you introverted a then kind of meditative and calming so it's good for both social situations and for you know kind of being by yourself you know you can't really go wrong with this strain it is a nice balance to strain um it does get your thoughts flowing you're the creative juices going and in higher doses it can become ramble you all that however it does end up going down into the body and it's really great for pain heavy relax it's just a very drooping almost melting effect down the body not quite melting it's more of a drooping effect um but you're not couch lecture act if you're able to get up and do things you know so that's why I like it's a very potent string but you can either be very relaxed relaxing or very very calming and higher dose of course it is gonna help you go to sleep um it's great for you know being outside and meditating you know stuff like that um however with too much um and with a lot of activity around you if you're prone to it can make you irritable and anxious of course so you know that's always a factor but however you know dictate your doses you know just you know measured your doses that's all not saying absolutely stay away from any strange just if you're not sure start small and kind of you know wait 5-10 minutes sometimes it can take ten minutes for something to peak so you know and then when a if you feel ready go from there but most the people watching this is already gonna know that of course but that said I am gonna have another Bowl cheers everyone well hmm hmm that was an explosive it mm-hmm that one was very expensive oh but it was delicious

that stuff that's the stuff hi everybody how's it growing welcome today we've got a little bit of drama alert going on I just want to be completely transparent with you people with you people I just want to be completely transparent with the community um some of you may have noticed a little bit of drama going on on on YouTube or sorry on Instagram I actually don't have that here I can actually put the picture up I'm gonna bring the picture up here I want to show you guys something about crop king seeds we're gonna have a little talk about crop king seeds today I'm gonna try my damndest not to actually no there we go disconnected even I don't know what is going on with my internet today I'm back I'm back I don't know what is going on that is really weird here we go let me let me bring up this company here I wanna burn them all right there we go okay so crop Kings seeds has started five new sorry for new companies to hide their well to hide their poor reputation crop Kings seeds has a pretty bad a pretty bad reputation I'm again I'm not gonna get into why that's up to you to decide I'm not trying to tell you to buy seeds or not to buy seeds I just want you guys to understand that there are multiple companies under the exact same roof so we're looking at beaver seeds which is new Sonoma seeds which I've grown Sunwest genetics which I've also grown blim Blum blimburn seeds I've never even heard of that but that's their them as well that's that new black company right there as well as crop King seeds all of these companies are the same company you need to understand that all of these seeds are coming from crop king and they are just different labels merely to deceive people into buying their seeds now again I'm not trying to trash crop King in any shape or form here I'm just trying to a little PSA if you will now I will be very transparent and explain the situation here a little bit crop Kings seeds was my very first supporter on this channel so I trying not to completely burn my bridge with this one I I have no love for crop king anymore so that's irrelevant but crop king seeds did sponsor me and I won one of their contests and they did some nice things for me not gonna lie as a company they did some nice things for me over my early days of this of youtubing however when my liaison the fella that I was dealing with on the regular basis no longer he he like changed jobs I don't know if he quit or was fired but he left he is no longer working at the company the new liaison was absolutely rude to me didn't know who I was or what I was doing and didn't help me at all and then shortly after my affiliate account was deleted so all of the money I made from affiliate marketing was lost and then they're trying to tell me now that I only made $20 and that the TOS states that you have to have a certain threshold and I know for a fact 100% for a fact that I made more than $20 on the affiliate marketing now I don't care they can keep the money they obviously need it that bad if they're trying to steal it off of people on disability and small growers that were trying to help them out if they're willing to take my money and and dr. things they can have it that's fine there are lots of seed banks out there I just want you guys to be aware of what companies like this well this company specifically does they basically left me high and dry in a time of need and then we're very rude to me and then deleted all my accounts and basically ghosted me for almost six months and then had the audacity about three days ago to send me an email and said hey we seen you did a review on one of our one of our grows a while ago and we would like to offer you an affiliate program and I'm like are you [ __ ] kidding me I'm like you guys [ __ ] owe me money from the affiliate program and there are yes 100% there are other youtubers that have quarrels with crop king seeds I'm not going to talk about their names you guys can say whatever you want again I'm not here to point fingers or spread rumors but I just wanted again everybody to be very transparent about this and just sort of tell you what's going on again I've had my experience with crop king seeds have been mixed as far as actual quality goes some people have had great experiences and I'm not trying to tell everybody that they're bad not to buy them I've had some I really like their CBD cheese it's a very unstable genetic be very aware that it's this is actually their CBD cheese right here it's wonderfully good smelling stuff but very unstable all of their uh it's just I don't know what to say man I've had a lot of germination issues there and here's the only other thing I want to say bad-mouthing them before I just smoked this joint and cool down is their customer service is [ __ ] terrible crop King if you do watch this hire some customer service liaisons some one's because your customer service is second to none for the worst ratings if you look up 90% of the problems is with your guys's customer service heck that's how I became an affiliate when I emailed you guys about a problem I had and your guy told me to [ __ ] off and he [ __ ] swore at me on an email and then after I messaged them back and said you guys are [ __ ] [ __ ] or if you are you really gonna treat me like this I said I'm a small youtuber but I will blast the [ __ ] out of you guys if this is how you're gonna treat your customers and oh I'm sorry I'm sorry we we took that guy out of the seat there was a guy yesterday he was having a problem and he was grumpy in bla bla bla no no excuse I'm sorry I'm a new person let me help fix this and then they kissed my ass hard hard so that I wouldn't trash them again I'm grateful for the things that they have given me I'm not trying to completely say they're a horrible company or anything like that I just want people to be aware that they are wearing masks they are wearing four masks indeed trying to hide their name and that's fine every company deserves everybody deserves a fresh start whether you're a company or a person all that kind of stuff man everybody deserves a fresh start but they're not hiding this [ __ ] man I'm not letting them hide it they were so and they had a massive whoever's in charge of the Instagram stream last night had a massive freak out on me from my post I wish I have some of it saved oh it's my other phone damn it I have some of it saved screenshots just because they were being crazy I got seriously 18 posts from them in about 15 minutes they were all like why don't you tell [ __ ] you're not telling the whole story you got bridges to burn that you burnt to and I'm like like what how did I burn a bridge tell me please it was uh it was interesting some people saw it for sure again it's just uh it's just a drag when drama happens I'm not a fan of drama and this is why I'm trying to sort of clear the air I just want people to know what the [ __ ] was happening that's it I know someone conjoint and cool the [ __ ] down after I smoke a joint I'm gonna probably forget about this and leave it at that do I do I hold massive ill will towards crop king yeah am I gonna let it go yep am I gonna harass them [ __ ] no point meant they were kind of rude to me on the on the thing last night they kinda tried to accommodate me but I just I wasn't having it man they they're lying to me they're straight-up thieving from me they're saying I only earned $20 when I know for a fact I have family members and friends that I sent there that bought more than $20 worth of affiliate sales so I know they're a hundred percent lying on the stats and I'm not the only person to have had this issue with them so just be careful be careful when you get into bed with companies that the terms of services are usually you breed that [ __ ] man read that [ __ ] really carefully before you enter a contract with a company be real man that's why I'm smoking a joint life is too short for drama I just wanted to clear up the air and smoke a joint and then I'll move on I've actually had a lot of people ask me here this is something I can finish talking about while I'm smoking this joint I got a lot of people ask me what's the good seed bank if if crop King sucks if crop Kings not a good seed bank they're not a seed bank by the way they were a seed retailer that has multiple labels that makes it look like they're a bank but they're not anyway if we don't use crop king who do we use I know people have problems with True North I people have problems with this and that and I love growing marijuana people have problems with lots of different companies the reality is look for the strains that you want that's my suggestion there's lots and lots of good reputable seed banks out there I'm not even saying that crop king is that bad I'm just over it I'm done I'm washing my hands of it that's all yeah Google is a wonderful place it depends where you live in the world if you live in America there's a different sets of options if you live in Canada there's different sets of options if you live in the UK or Australia different options you know I've been hunting all over the world for a few seeds I got some seeds I'm buying here at the end of the month I finally tracked the buggers down but I got to get them from a weird little hole in the wall from the UK somewhere man so you know in chat there people are talking a ton of frickin good seed banks I can't do to tune terms of service of YouTube I can't actually save this one or this one or post any links to any of them but there's a lot out there man but I highly suggest strain hunting I highly suggest finding that strain that you liked smoking from the dispensary or your buddy had chocolate or white widows your favorite or whatever your favorite strain is look for that strain and then find out who sells it and buy from them I'm not saying crop king seeds doesn't sell a sunflower seeds they sell cannabis I'm not saying they're terrible but I can't promote them any longer that's all Durbin poison yeah that's a good one and see that's the thing is you get the seed banks that are accessible might not have that strain so you might need to do a little bit of googling and find a seed bank that has the strain that you're after that's the best way to buy but be careful be careful there's a lot of scammers out there and in the early days I don't even want to get into this early days of crop king had some financial issues let's say and let's just leave it at that I don't wanna I don't want he said she said stuff anymore I'm trying to let it go I've almost done this joint and when I'm done this joint I'm gonna be done the conversation about crop king I heard white rhinos being rebranded as black rhino by the breeders hmm I wonder I wonder cuz like the white rhinos are extinct now or something I wonder if that has anything to do with it now crop king is done sucking my energy I am done with it your stickers are still not here they were sent they'll be there today maybe tomorrow then hopefully tomorrow they should be I have the other one here but yeah for anybody interested in the stickers these also come in shirts where's my sticker stack and oh here it is and the tuff dabber stickers these also come all in shirt formats which you can buy on canopy or gross com by the way that actually brings me up to a quick little point folks for anybody interested I'm gonna have to do a another thing about this but this is just some recent news that develop doo-doo dee-dee-dee-dee breaking report breaking report it seems that my old code got compromised somehow ended up on a [ __ ] discount website or something anyway folks if you guys want a guerilla grow tent of your own you can get a

gorilla glue number four I did a um a review on gorilla glue before well it's not really a review you know but I gave me what I thought about gorilla glue before but this is gorilla glue number four the original blue gorilla glue number four developed by GG strains is a potent hybrid strain that delivers heavy handed euphoria and relaxation leaving you feeling glued to the couch okay thinking could he gave us a little more than that Yelp it's chunky resin covered buds fill the room with pungent earthy and sour aromas they went a little too far with that when I wanted some extra but not that much actually I am so this is my grill ooh number four it's kind of shaky but I don't mind smoking shake that's better for my boat anyway here's one of the notes other gorillas be number four uh me see if I can get it there focus for you there go anyway it is really really stinky but not taking a bad way staying in go away so I hope y'all had a beautiful blast nights not much here right here a little bit more y'all see behind me it's it's not calm it's about a 5:15 a.m. but what I might get up every day well I just like get up probably bout 4:30 I don't know why I get up early some old people [ __ ] I guess anyway there's a really nice smell that Oh stranded I had yesterday Oh No the dumpster dairy man act you can tell that was a indica because I was every time I smoked it I get like I feeling really hot but we're really sleepy anyway let's jump in to this gorilla glue number four always like gorilla glue number four but my favorite I guess I would have to say my all-time framing probably everybody's all-time favorite is [ __ ] Sour Diesel anyway let's jump in here [Music] I tried to be greedy and disrespected the expansion rate on this is really it's not it's strong it's not really strong I would say mildly sprint expansion rate in your lungs you know how it expands your lungs this is model expansion rate but what the problem was I try to get greedy anyway so hope you got a had a beaut had a beautiful blessed day yesterday and I hope today it's gonna be blessed for you too let's make this day legendary won't you be conscious some people try something try random acts of kindness you'd be amazed how far it goes anyway that's jump right back in wasn't trying to be greedy at all so for those people before they didn't catch it earlier videos proper way to smoke weed blunt bowl anything yes the Broadway movie hold it I see people on other YouTube channels smoking a week you know that smoking like a cigarette and that's why you don't really get hot when people say you know what I used to get hot but I don't get high anymore this cuz you thought it was cool to smoke like a cigarette in and out of course you get hard but you'll have to smoke more me I like to conserve as much weed as I can because I like to keep around as long as I can with that being said I could take a point five and put it in this bowl and be high for hours of course I smoked a lot but I don't I don't smoke a lot like want us to have a sitting I don't smoke a lot now I smoke a lot during the course of the day it's really tasty that dumpster dirty I had yesterday I understand why why it was originally called the trash strength because that stuff was literally trash and that was dispensary grade this is street grade and it's it's way better than that maybe it's because I like city was better so y'all know what i'ma say that's if you haven't already subscribed to channel go ahead subscribe to the channel hit that post notification bell so you don't miss any of the cool videos so you can wake and bake with me every day at least every day I have a new strength I'm gonna see how far in how deep this rabbit hole goes I know this dismisses friends so there will be me is a video clown about means I'll say thousands of strands so they're least be thousands of videos I'm doing this because I like to get high I like I love waking bait I'm sure you guys do too greedy get anyway if you guys you guys like these videos or want to see more videos just let me know what you want to see yeah cuz I'm interested in making you and keeping you guys interested now I'm pretty sure it's it's interesting watching me smoking critique the marijuana but or the cannabis is everybody likes to say it I don't know why they play so play around so much with the terminology when you're in a state that's about to go legal when you walk into a dispensary you can't say hey what kind of weed do you guys got because for some reason their terminology is messed up you can't say weed you can't say marijuana don't they say it's cannabis or a flower it's crazy it's like you guys anybody actually listening to me you guys know what I'm saying when I say I need some weed right okay I need some weed do you mean cannabis no [ __ ] I need some [ __ ] weed what the hell I understand how they be how they trip off the terminology of it everybody knows the terminology originated from the streets so now the government or the state the powers that be is trying to change the language of the marijuana we all know as we trees a chiba whatever you want to call it that's what it is you know what it is uh-huh she's like everything's got to try and be so legal and that's why America is so messed up is closed everything is trying to be so freakin legal so perfect the government is the last to tell the public anything that's beneficial to them that's what sucks if anything is beneficial to the public the government ain't gonna tell you about that man cuz it's gonna mess them up because their business is keeping us sick and poor and damn their time so the doctors can make money so that the doctors get passed the money on on to the next to the lawyers you know so so everybody could pass money on they keep it rolling amongst themselves this is why they do the stupid stuff that they do I just recently heard that the government finally admitted that there is a such thing as UFOs there's always been a such thing as UFOs your folks don't mean aliens it means an unidentified flying object that means I can't identify what the hell that is fine we know as people for people from another planet we know that because we don't have anything it goes that fast and does that stuff we know that there's been millions of people have that have seen of spaceships or whatever maybe not aliens believe seen spaceships and the government's all yeah there's no such thing as that yeah no you know we don't know now what suddenly like yeah okay well maybe there is a spaceship come on you guys I'm rambling so let me get back to the point at hand that's because I'm a high and this is a good up be high this is up I feel like wants her beat ha go to pieces early and wake your baby mmm might be something to do the only problem is that the police load to be down the beach and though I have a medical marijuana card I still can't smoke in public another one of the government things that is so [ __ ] it's like if I have a medical marijuana card which I do that means that I am legally able to smoke cannabis it you know I'm legally able to smoke cannabis as a medication so if I'm legally able to smoke it as a medication and is legal that means this legal is alcohol which means that a beer I could drink a beer out in my front yard I can't walk down the street drinking a beer of course but I could drink a beer on my front yard but let me smoke a jail my front yard a police riot bar there's gonna be some problems even though I have a car there's gonna be some problems and I'd like to know
