{"NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future

got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick

much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "zrQKILuOYfc": "welcome to blue crayon extracts today I'm going to show you a little bit about our products or CBD babe cartridge product it's full spectrum CVE has 750 milligrams of CBD in the 1000 milligram cartridge and then we also have a 500 milligram cartridge that contains 375 milligrams of active CBD that's roughly around 3.75 milligrams per puff depending on how big your puffs sizes are and then same goes for the 750 milligrams CBD cartridge it's about seven point five milligrams per possible on average so I open up the little container here and inside I have the USB mini charger the battery battery sold separately but you know we we ship it in the in a box like this but then you can put it inside your container which is kind of handy and then we have the actual CBD distillate vape cartridge here that comes in its own little container which you can stand up on its own or you could you know some you know some people like to put actually on the battery pen itself its standard 510 threading on this and then you can the container there now vaping CBD is you know is entirely different way of ingesting it then then through your digestive tract for the digestive tract you're only absorbing a certain percentage of the total amount of CBD that's in the product whereas vaping it you're getting and practically entirely all of it and it's going directly in your bloodstream so when you vape CBD you know you're feeling the effects almost immediately so it's great for you know after a sports event and you have aches and pains you can you can vape after that you have a big meeting or a big presentation it's always good to vape a little CBD before those and you know you you get the instant the CBD the benefits of the CVD and this is CBD distillate so it's got a it's got a high viscosity to it it doesn't really move much until it's heated up and when the oil is heated up it turns into a vape vapour basically what else can I tell you now our carts our cartridges are actually really high-tech cartridges they have eight oil holes in the bottom of the cartridge so that all the oil when it when it keeps up and drips down at all get you so no oil ever goes to waste and then we actually have there's there's our top airflow holes on the cartridge at the top and that allows you to pull the air up from the top as opposed to the bottom of the cartridge or the bottom of our cartridges are sealed airtight so there's never any leaks I'll show you let me show you imperative cartridge competitors cartridge so oil they have side holes not like bottom holes like ours and the oil gets stuck in between the side holes and then that they're bought the bottom of their cartridge is not sealed and so you'll you'll get leaks sometimes coming through the bottom of these so back to our cartridge here I know if you have any questions you can always just shoot us an email at support at blue chronic stress calm and let me now show you about let me show you all about the battery so basically to turn on you click it five times five times in a row and then it turns along and then for the lowest setting is 2 point 7 volts it's white and say you're just you know you can hold it down it has a 10 second time timeout so you can hold it down take your puff release it the second setting to advanced settings you click it three times now it goes to the second setting which is three point one volts this is a good medium setting the first setting actually is great cuz you can really taste the terpenes in it once you start getting up to a higher setting you kind of burn off those terpenes or heat off those terpenes and so is it it all depends on your personal preference and then the third setting the highest settings is 3 point 6 volts and it's the color red and you click it three times and it goes to red now this also has a quote this pen actually has a cool feature where if you're let's say you're out outside on a hike and it's really cold out and they'll you know the CBD distillates you know pretty solid you can there's a preheat setting where you click it two times and then it'll go for fifteen seconds it will preheat your oil so if it's cold out it will it will get it going and then when you take your first take your first puff off it will it will help hit nicely and I'm gonna go ahead and take a puffer like I said has a 10 second shot off so you can never really overheat the distillate I hope you enjoyed watching our video today and again as I said if you have any questions please email us at support at blue crown extracts calm thank you", "LDiJGkI3Q-0": "this channel is strictly for viewers 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal

total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try

"ZCgLfXMXKk4": "hi there and welcome into another episode of how to from cure to you with me your host Noah today we're gonna tackle something that we've heard a lot in our dispensaries as of late you're going through and you're seeing the difference between two cartridges one says liquid live resin the other one says co2 and my word what is the difference before we delve into that there's one thing that we need to understand before we can talk about the different extractions to make those and that's the trichome of the plant the trichome is actually that white kind of bulbous part you see on the dry leaf itself and today I have a visual aid so as you can see these are the trichomes you can see the nice bulb on top and the reason that these are important is because those trichomes housed all of the THC CBD all of our turf beans all those can monoids are found in that little Bowl right on top and the reason that that's important is because to make our cartridges and our concentrates we are extracting that trichome off the planet so now that we understand what a trichome is let's talk about the differences that we see in our dispensaries of co2 versus liquid live resin so first off we're going to talk about liquid live resin and the main difference between this and the co2 extraction is at its harvest point when the dry leaf itself is ready to be harvested in a liquid live process they harvest it and then they flash freeze the bud once they flash freeze the bud it maintains its whole plant structure and then it's put through the extraction process using a butane hash oil wash where it pulls the trichomes off of that frozen plant and it maintains its chirping profile a little bit more so so you get a little bit more of a flavorful more tasteful medication when it comes to a liquid live extraction process but the main key is is that they are frozen at the point of harvest I have my co2 cartridge here now and the main difference between that we go back to the harvest point for the co2 extraction we harvest the buds and then we dry and cure them which is just a fancy Dancy way of saying we remove them of their water weight in some times during that process we can strip away some of the terpenes and so with co2 process we've put a we harvest our plants we dry and we cure them we put them in the extraction machine and instead of using that butane hash oil or BHO they use co2 to strip away those trichomes off of the plant to create a more extracted and concentrated form of cannabis and that's the basic difference between the co2 and liquid live resin is at the harvest point remember liquid live resin is flash frozen flowers where the co2 is going to be the buds are dried and then cured and then put through the extraction process but wait a minute there's a third one that we see in our dispensaries that's now becoming more popularized and it's called a distillate a distillate is used creating co2 extraction methods but once it's extracting out those trichomes they separate the terpenes and the cannabinoids the smell and the taste of the flower from the actual THC and CBD and then they distill it out and they purify it to remove any unwanted products like your chlorophyll and your plants or any residual byproducts of the extraction process once those things are distilled they're purified they're reintroduced with terpenes to create a more pure cannabis experience when it comes to your flower so basically at the end of this we have like we live with the flash frozen buds we have the co2 where our buds are dried and cured and then put through the extraction process and the number-three that you didn't even know we were going to talk about is the distillation process to create that purified distilled product that's able to be used in a cartridge now the main question that we also hear is what is the difference is there any medicinal difference between them and right now there isn't really any evidence that states one way or the other that's co2 or liqui live is more medicinal a beneficial than the other but if we use our logical sense here if we have a co2 extraction process and we lose some of our terpenes and we know terpenes work with THC whereas liquid live we maintain some of those terpenes a little bit more so one could venture a guess and say that liquid live might be a little bit more medicinally beneficial for you but that's just based upon you know a to B B to C then and that's just my opinion right now but hopefully is the future the more we learn about this the easier this process becomes and sometimes hopefully those questions will be answered but right now I'm here to give you my expertise in this field and that's it we went over three cartridges we went over what a trichome is and now you're a little bit more educated in this process so if you have any other questions comments concerns please do not hesitate to let us know we're here to help you you can get in

your pillows yeah and you would come and smoke how often oh I couldn't go longer than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love

the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to

cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on

today with a west coast suite tour review featuring the cure companies diablo og one gram high potency thc distillate cartridge so we're looking at 98.22 total cannabinoids on this product 94 thc uh specifically 94.7 percent thc delta 9 at 94.66 so high potency high potency high potency that's what this product is all about superior quality cannabis goods i'll show you guys some of the packaging here it's cool black white logo got the extracts added in there to stand out diablo og is a classic og strain you can get some of the testing information there on the back we've got this pretty cool reflective superior quality cannabis goods thing there and a bunch of information on the back i'd like to see the genetics i'd like to see the terpenes but they're not listed it does say that the ingredients have 100 premium cannabis distillate extract so i do like that um are the terpenes botanical or the terpenes cannabis who knows how to use attached cartridge to 510 thread battery take three second draw exhale repeat as needed so today we're going to use the vessel battery i've got um it's set on the lowest temperature we're going to see if that's enough to get the distillate to fire up um child proof packaging is currently working on me though let me try to get this open ah there we go all right so check this out you guys beautiful got this white uh ceramic tip the glass window here to see the actual oil that we got clear rubber coverings and stoppers on the mouthpiece and on the coil down at the bottom where the connector meets the battery so i'll kind of show you guys this a little closer check that out it's a beautiful product i can't really smell anything through the tip it does have a little bit of red ringage going on the top so looks like the terpenes have definitely been doing a little bit of reacting but we shall see how this tastes you guys can see that color a little bit there at the top a little bit concerning so here we go one two three four five oh one two three four five turn the vessel back on beautiful there we go all right one two three here we go one hit review talk about it i'll do a second hit give you guys a score out of ten we're supposed to do baby let's go it rips it's smooth it tastes good i do love the branding of the car i love how the cure company put their logo on the actual glass of it i think that's super dope but taste wise it's pretty decent earthy sweet spicy not a little not too much pine there's some lavenderiness with some linalool in there for sure i enjoy it i enjoy it i'll need to do a second hit to see if it's really going to be at this 98 you know total cannabinoids i'm not super duper high right now um run it here we go again i'm tasting that little there's a nice soft lavenderiness to this got a little bit of pine on tiny bit on that last one but the most part just getting that earthiness just getting this spice tiny tiny tiny bit of floral pine and a lot a lot of lineal in there this lavender-ness and so i really enjoy it i am concerned about this ring at the top when you think about the packaging date it was back in it was manufactured in january 21 2020 the date of the packaging of this product so when they stuck the card into the packaging um what was it july 16 2020 so there's a clear difference that's that six months difference i don't know what happened here with this but definitely concerning [Music] you know cartridges are tricky um but i definitely feel like merchandising and making sure that you know the product quality stays consistent i feel like that's totally achievable but as you guys can see there is some really strong discoloration let me pull the sticker off here for you guys there is very much a strong discoloration um at the very top of all that distillate and so because of that i'm definitely gonna have to give them a score in the low you know uh between a five and a six to be honest i think the product quality when it comes to the flavor the high the way that it's branded and packaged and the high thc nature i think all that adds up to an experience that should be very good um but we definitely want to make sure that we're keeping people safe and or making sure that their questions are uneasiness uh those kinds of things are not you know taken care of and or these kind of problems are just non-existent so because of that and this specifically five to six out of ten super rough score but you know like i said uh just make sure you guys talk to the bartender always ask to see the packaging day always ask to see the harvest date for a lot of things that'll help you guys avoid getting product that might be bad expired or going bad or whatever it is so jfing here coming at you guys live man west coast week 2 review we keep it real we keep it honest it's not always great but it's good feedback so i love you guys i'll see y'all down the road 5.6 five to six five point six whatever y'all want to do out of ten care company i'll see y'all down the road love you guys peace", "S_PLcfNv_gg": "[Music] p2pt [Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps welcome to season 3 everybody and for our video here today we're gonna be checking out some himalaya super sour diesel for the most part i don't really like distillate stuff right but there are some good distillate brands out there and himalaya is for show one of those so i had their live resin first if for those of you who are veterans of the channel you guys know i did try out uh something a long time ago but before we go and more into that let's go ahead take a hit y'all thank you guys for joining me for season three and uh once again is that super sour diesel from himalaya vapor and i got that battery from him too right here so cheers up everybody hope you guys are enjoying your day or whatever time it may be when you're watching man cheers [Music] it's a tiny little hit there just because we want to get that flavor so a big thing about these this himalayan distillate cartridge so far is that flavor man on the box here it says terpene rich you know what i'm saying and this is for show terpene rich this tastes phenomenal like out of all the distillates i have had this definitely sets in the smoothest you know hits the smoothest and i'm not getting too much scratchiness from my throat there and it definitely has the most kind of like cannabis kind of taste if that's a word kind of busy but um you know it doesn't taste like artificial flavors or fruit or anything like that it just tastes like some really good terps like you know that you could probably you know find you know your normal flour and all that so that's that's what we're rocking with here man i know i didn't say the percentages but here we go we got 91 total active cannabinoids in this one so this cartridge for show can pack a punch so that's the good thing you know they're not really listing out that thc percentage which isn't a bad thing for me that's normally a good sign when i see cannabinoid percentage over thc percentage you know we all want that you know uh uh entourage effect you know full spectrum type of high and uh you gotta appreciate it with a product like this man so let's go ahead and take a blinker now and i'll talk more about what i'm tasting and [ __ ] so cheers everybody [Music] oh man now that hit packed a freaking punch man so this is a sativa strain not exactly one more like my favorites you know what i mean like uh sativa is not exactly what i prefer to smoke on but a super sour d is a classic and i am digging the flavors we're getting here pininess some sour there not it's not too crazy of a sour um i know sometimes when i try super sour diesel that limonene sticks out hella tough and it makes it taste a lot more lemony instead of like just regular kind of like like a sour tinge and that's what i'm getting here you know i'm not getting too much of a citrusy sour i'm just getting like a quick little undertones of it with a little tiny little bit of sweetness but mostly that gassy kind of piney flavor so that's it's good stuff man it's real good stuff okay so for those of you who are curious man we're working with about 431 milligrams thc 1.2 milligrams of cbd well that's that's all i can say about this you know the cartridge so far guys i like the flavor it is indeed terpene rich 91 total cannabinoids this thing will smack you and um you know it's just a smooth cartridge man unless you're taking a fat hit you're probably not gonna cough much off this one it's really smooth so we're gonna take one last hit here end off the video and i hope you all have been enjoying it and i hope y'all go check out some more himalaya products man they make great great stuff and be sure to watch out because guys let me go pull this out real quick we are going to have another himalaya product pop up soon this one is the blueberry muffin live resin cartridge i've been waiting a long time to open this one so thank you guys for watching let's take one more hit here and before i take this hit guys don't forget to like comment subscribe share the video whatever you want to do all that [ __ ] man but yeah thank you guys so much and [Music] cheers yes this [ __ ] is guys michelle so this has been p2 peeps and i hope you guys are going to be enjoying more content and things coming soon from me man so p2 out peace", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "dU9NVR4mOx0": "[Music] hey everyone today we're gonna be giving you a list of our top five oil cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best

probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized

THC card that I picked up from ki relief by delivery order I paid forty eight dollars for this cartridge and it came in at an impressive eighty four point three percent THC or four hundred and twenty one point six milligrams this is another C cell cartridge with a ceramic coil that enhances flavor the flavor of this card on exhale is sweet fruity and piney onto the effects the first effect I felt was a cerebral Head busing sort of like tingly that quickly turned into a big old smile on my face that stayed through the effects plenty of happiness from within that also remained stronger inner joy than demand that music and dancing and my pain lower to a1 through the duration of the effects too it melts my excit and stress away like a blowtorch of calm and I also get very social and sadi when

cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "opnzUN_AtFc": "hey what's good everybody jp here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test vape review featuring justin bietender from mad men beverly hills and the buddies brand cannabis derived terpenes and distillate vape cartridge this is the cush mints strain so i love cushions buddies brand um i myself an employee so you're going to be doing the review today uh thank you for coming on being a guest 85.09 total cannabinoids 82 or 82.43 total percent thc not super high potent but high potent nonetheless uh terpene profile four point two seven percent limonene i love that that's all displayed on the back gotta love them here you go check this out you guys that's a huge point especially for people that come into the store they don't know what cartridges are in general yup and you know specifically people don't think cartridges are good for you right now so just that barrier alone kind of keeps people away from the section so for the fact that you can look on the back of this and have all this displayed it's great education absolutely important especially for me the three terps on the back are the i believe it's limonene and then i think it's some beta caryophyllene and then what is it mercian what is the other one yeah better mercy nope not better piney so it's not the terpest of the distillate carpenters that we offer at buddies but four percent is still a very high number and it's not botanical this is from cannabis plants all single source same strain so nice the way i'd like you to do the review today is number one be honest be yourself if you hate it be real if you don't like the inhale or the exhale just be honest please cartridges are huge for me specifically just on the go for convenience um and to be honest with you i have heavy tolerance so anyways intolerance out there cartridge is really if this doesn't get you high you're you can tell the difference between a good cartridge and something that yeah yeah that's fine okay this is how i open these keep it real yeah so ours come you know in the plastic container inside of the box obviously so that way you know you can see the outside of the box with the you know with the same color cartridge on the out the information and then if you pop that tube you can actually smell the terps before you taste them which is something that i really enjoy whether it's the live resin liquid diamonds or the cdt carts these always taste like the strain and so we've got the c cell battery right here no button just the draw um i encourage you to give it a twist don't over tighten it just make sure it's on there um i would say snug but not tight and then see so battery like you said correct so for me i personally don't like to overheat anything if i like to get good flavor i want to do three to five second rip if i'm going for huge clouds 7 10 12 or you know second grip wow tastes really good cushman's again is the strain if you've had cushman's before please let us know what your thoughts are in the comments smash that like smash that dislike if you hate it yeah you can taste the terpenes right over the aftertaste earthy piney lemony what are you getting piney for sure so we confirmed on the pine that's solid what are we on the back here you getting any citrus a little bit i'm going to take a fat rip like you said you said nine second drop five six seven seconds something along those lines oh luckily luckily i have a backup in my pocket all right here we go all right dude the quick pivot y'all i think this is good that was super clutch so we got a button battery now yeah button battery now i'm still five ten three battery universal swapped it right on out so bam bam quick and easy seven seconds you can rip it there we go there we go there we go and this will be a good club and a lot more flavor there it is much more flavor what do you think okay i can taste that in my terpenes so this is how you confirm it now you so they this is this is tested you paid for this right do you taste those it's a taste test they give you the recipe it's almost like um i had a faint lemon drink not like an actual lemonade but something with a little bit of lemon in it so i can definitely taste that lemonade after effect was more floral on the initial draw i like the fact that i can kind of feel it in my eyes it's um cushman's you can kind of feel a little bit of that body high from the mirror would you say it's heavier than 82 percent i think so yeah this actually takes a lot better than the traditional co2 distillate cartridges that i've had a lot better than some of the brands that we have in our store to be honest this is just um in my opinion uh super heavy on the body like i said super faint not enough to where i can't go out and maybe work out i can still function like i said but i do like the fact that i do have a nice nice little high from one really fat draw that's important because i'm again i got something with a decent tolerance so i can see myself hitting this four or five times wow getting a nice oh the nice right away roast your nose i tell you i tell you what wow that first little puff that i did out just caused the whole body high right away uh the high behind my eyes through my elbows that's for sure i like the fact that a smoothie don't get that kind of chemical yeah after tasting this you're not too harsh on the throat there's no popcor popcorn in burn again i appreciate that because i'm not you know i again i'm really harsh on cartridges because if i'm going to use them i would like them to work facts this could definitely definitely does more than get the job in my opinion that's good again traces there the desired effect is what i really appreciate more from this so the fact that again all the stuff is displayed you know what terpenes are in here what's your score out of 10. in terms of comparing this to distillate in terms of did what you not even comparison to other things just the product itself what are you wait rating it on in your experience the box the brand the experience primarily the taste experience what are you doing i'm going to give this close to a tent as possible what does that mean tim i'm going to say a 9.8 for sure i think down from the packaging to the product um very impressive um no bias here you got to be extra strict i don't want anyone here to get it twisted be extra strict on this right now this is extremely important that alone is a standout the fact that the terror things are displayed here all the information is on here so sorry i kind of ripped up the package you're all good but if you're a customer and you walk in you know exactly what you're getting and then so then you're set up for okay is this going to be as good as the packaging award-winning distillate featuring cso cartridge

its mastery its capacity to represent throughout history attempts have been made to contain that those experiences happen at the age of the limit where the mind is vulnerable but I think we are at a very significant moment in history what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be another Nate cartridge review it is a proprietary I wouldn't say proprietary but it is like they have a battery for that specific cartridge and from the looks of it this chill very very much similar to that of orchid essentials but you know they have their own twist on anything at different flavors all that good stuff but I picked this up at haul of flowers for only two dollars so I don't know the exact price of this but I will post all their information or on the screen I'm not too sure if I'm gonna post it in the bottom description below just because I've been getting this is my third channel now and I don't want to risk linking to any other sites or whatever so I'm just gonna post on the screen now I'm saying and just you know you could check out their Instagram by typing in yourself manually I just feel like this is the better way for me to go about my channel because this Bureau I don't honestly I don't want to be deleted again so I'm trying to take the extra precautions of not to get deleted but at the same time I could get deleted again so I mean whatever but you know let's just make this a less of a chance for me to get deleted you know zine so I mean right here off the bat you see sour apricot good stuff chill is the brand yeah but the back you can pause if I'm going too fast guys I know I'm usually yes oh yes but as you can see right here it is a distillate paid cartridge so definitely something that we've tried before it is turn in terms of you know the oil like we tried to slip before but let's try to get this out so there is a thing right here just get that open for you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on today as usual you know I'm saying it's just this is life's better when you chill and you got a you got a hold these two little thing right here and a little thing right here very very nice so we're going to sit this down right here we have a micro USB charger you know I'm saying it's a the braided cords as well so I mean it's a small cord I think they only use the braided to like have less tangles on your cords play if it's this small I mean it's not really necessary in turn win a $2,500 for a location of your choosing once you get away from all the chill text winner to that and you will be entered for a chance to win $25,000 I mean $22,500 as well as a chance to win other cool daily prizes check them out at chill calm chill keishon all that good stuff then thank you for choosing chill with us our team of growers and connoisseurs go to great lengths to deliver the careful balance of quality flavor and potential potency in all our products why because we believe that the feel-good effects of cannabis and community go hand-in-hand I don't know if they want me to show that I mean they have in here they probably want me to show there you have it very very nice paper go [ __ ] never seen paper like this um basic stuff with that you know and it says all the stuff that's better when you chill so you could pause if I'm going too fast but I'm gonna get straight into the to the pen because I mean I've been doing this for so long five times to turn off three times have changed you know all that good stuff so the cartridge itself very very nice very very and it is a distillate guy so you will see it kind of move I'm actually not seeing it move but I mean I left it upside down in the package before and I seen it move so but very very thick the battery for a very very nice looking sleek gunmetal dope just just a nice overall pen all right since these are different I gotta read it at least so five times to turn it off uh click three times to enter so you click it three times and then you press it again to adjust then you hold it down oh okay so basically three times and then you adjust it with each one but then you hold it for two seconds to stop it it's a bit different but not too hard to understand cheers guys there is no preheating so we're just gonna go at it Cheers whoa cloud productions there this live it does taste like apricots I'm not gonna lie very very much like apricot it is a hybrid as well and as far as distillate goes you guys already know what distally it's unflavored the final product it's unflavored and then they add terpenes into it so if you guys are like into that stuff you know like plug and play or this horse dizzy and I really recommend it like people will just see this and think it's just another vape in and I'm not gonna lie for our artificial fruit Terps I'm liking this apricot it's pretty good I'm not even a fan of apricot but it's pretty good mmm let me hit it again where you guys it's definitely not lacking in vapor production and uh as far as like the price goes I'm guessing that this is going to be costing you a pretty penny like I'm guessing maybe around 50 to around 90 maybe 90 for the whole kit because you know with the battery they usually sell things with the battery for more but I'm either guessing maybe in the 40 to maybe 60 dollars for the cartridge this is just my assumption I have not seen it priced anywhere I have not even seen this in the local dispensary near me so if you guys want to give me a better understanding of what the prices are if you've seen this before you can let me know in the comments below but like if I had to guess it's probably going to be up there in terms of like plug-and-play orchid essentials it's just a really neat hole around looking pen you know I'm gonna hit it one more time for you guys I'm probably gonna end the video here check out chill I'll post their [ __ ] on the screen not too sure if I'm a post in the description because you know all that YouTube [ __ ] delete my account for selling and linking things so we're just going to be extra careful but one more hit you're probably gonna call it video yes oof tastes like [ __ ] my fruit candy but yes that's going to be it for the video hopefully you guys enjoyed it I will see you guys in the next one [Music] [Music] [Music]", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "Rff2iecMh2U": "so sit back and just roll up the perfect show for my smokers i really do like i i'm never going to buy i don't think ever again a distillate cart because you get that full taste in it and what in that compared to like some of the other ones like what what's your opinion i know you smoke concentrate more than me this is distillate right here right no that's live resin live resin distillate not just live resin what does that mean because well like because resin means like fresh frozen plant material yeah that's what this is but you can distill that and that's what you usually put in base and some people do that this is this is this is a hundred percent live resin vape same with this one but people do take live resin and dilute it but you can tell from the color like when you when you smoke a like a pure distillate vape it's like clear as [ __ ] like this is pure live resin because like you know being a bartender too but what's the extraction method the cold extraction method they i'm not a i need to see it firsthand but it's all they freeze dry it right away and then they use a super cold temp to extrude everything to get the whole terpene profile whereas with the distillate they're going to burn everything hot oil it down so when you're with a distillate it's like a whiskey it turns out clear and a lot of people don't realize that with whiskey that it's initially clear until they put it in oak barrels you know i was under the impression that like pretty much all these are just lit whether it's like rot live resin nug run you know but some of them they use rosin to put it because you have to like make it into that liquid [ __ ] you know and the only way to make like the main way they make those is through like chemical extraction through co2 or like butane or ethanol but even with the live resin you think because the livelihood doesn't just that just is the quality no but it's a different extraction method because the distillate is a hot method live resin i've understood is the the extra cold method at a certain temperature below the what i understand is live resin means you're using like fresh frozen materials whether you make it into distillate shatter you know they have like live resin shatter and that's made with butane you know yeah i mean but i guess maybe i guess no no no no well something because because i had because i have been and i think i guess i think where we might be like um maybe it's just a like a wordplay thing but i this i oh it is yeah it is you know but like the thing about these two i have here these live resin cards are legit i bought one the other day that was like watered down how much are those this [ __ ] was that's this [ __ ] this cart right here runs for well i didn't pay this much for it but this cart right here runs for 62 dollars for one gram oh okay i got this one for free too but they um my understanding was that it's always live resin no matter where it is it because this is not my my understanding was that a distillate has to go through the distillation process and live resin doesn't don't know yeah because that was my understanding but you're making me second guess myself well you should check it out because it might be different i know they do have some really fire rosin pens you know that's what they take the ice water extraction and they separate it and then they press it and they put it into there you know but look at the color of those compared to the other 1000 ones look more like yellow you know compared to other but that that's uh but that's rosin that's not resin right no rosin because it's pressed yeah so yeah yeah so this is different though resin is just that's like resin is what makes rosin you know so residence elaborate resins is like all the [ __ ] crystals and oils from the plant you know so but but i think i think no i think we're talking about three different processes we're talking about making a distillate we're talking about making a live resin and then we're talking about making a rosin i think that's well no they're they're all like live resin i'm just telling you that's just fresh frozen like material but no but it goes through it but you can try you can process live resin anyway no you can't though then it won't be yeah no but then but then it won't be 100 live resin because 100 live resin that's legit and i agree with you not all live resins made equal but like 100 live resin is not ever going to be heated up ever it can never be because that's not the process but they don't heat it they like they cool it yeah yeah yeah it's like a whole so that's why i'm saying so yeah so that's live resin but that's what i'm saying so that's live resin with the cool method but distillate is hot so it's they're not the same but people do die what if you have live resin just washed what's that because that's the best [ __ ] that's what's in these that this is 100 that [ __ ] doesn't come out like liquid that's what i'm doing but look look how thick this is like look at it like that shit's thick as [ __ ] dude no but on what i'm saying is like live resin isn't like goo you know it's like it's like cash you know it's like crystals it's like a so you're saying every so you're saying live resin this is interesting because i thought this is telling you that there's something else in there besides live resin extract to make it that liquid yeah yeah or else like because it's not going to be like liquid you know unless you're using like a chemical but this is like traction both of these look like something that you would press and just put in here though this one's a little more liquier but look like this [ __ ] doesn't even move like the shit's pretty solid yeah maybe well you'll have to check it out you know but i've never seen anything that's like a liquid like that that you can just press and then it's just like liquid i don't think they're pressing it they're not pressing it though but well then are they using co2 they're it's it's a whole method where it has to be below like negative 40 degrees so they're using like dry ice yeah they're using some crazy [ __ ] to push this [ __ ] out but like i mean i don't know it's just this is an interesting talk i'm just want to know if it's all natural you know but i don't i know this you know i know this one is for sure or that's what they've told me is that this one is for sure and i'm pretty sure this one is for sure and that's why like but can you do like i know you've smoked some distillate ones that i've gave you for sure like do you taste the difference does it feel more full do you feel um i don't know i don't i don't really you know it's pretty good it tastes good you know but i just want to know if it's like natural you know because if there's only certain ways you can extract i'm about to tour this facility and that's i guess that brings up a whole topic what what is natural what's like without any chemicals so using like heat ice water yeah so those are that's natural you know that's the [ __ ] you're paying a hundred dollars a grand for at the shops for like the [ __ ] paid that before i would never pay that i was like i've made that [ __ ] i've made my own live resident cash you know where you freeze your bud and you wash it in your bubble bags and it's like dabbable resin you know but it's hard to make in a hot environment because it likes to get super sticky you know this is a good conversation like it's the first time we've been on a podcast from what i know like for the most part all the like for most vapes have like chemical extraction in there unless it's like a live rosin or whatever you know but that's or it's like resin rosin just means heat and pressure but if it's with live resin that's going to like be like the highest for the best tasting and that's what this that's what this is supposed to be yeah i wish i had a different shittier cartridge because i had a couple shitty ones like and like i said i could i might even i had a pack over here that was a they said it was live resin but you look at it bro it was light as [ __ ] it didn't have this color and then after talking to some people they were telling me that a lot of people say it's live resin but it's diluted to your point with distillate so there so that's why i'm saying they're two different um things but distillate is like that's the process of making the [ __ ] out of weed they'd [ __ ] cut it with like vitamin k or something but that's where this is different though is because they don't do distillation but to your point well maybe they i'm curious how they make it because like i've seen the way they they do it with like liquid nitrogen and stuff like that where you you throw a bud in there and it like freezes off all the crystals and then you distill that down into like like a liquid like that yeah and that's where i wish that like i don't know i think that i and that's where i'm excited to tour a facility that does it so i can see and give a better answer and see what's going on but i am but to me i can taste the difference with these compared to other ones yeah there's like different there's definitely like levels of quality of those like if you go to like a legit shop and you pay like [ __ ] 60 bucks a gram you're gonna get a good one yeah you better it better be fine but it's like it's there's no guarantee that it's made with like no chemical extraction process you know because that's like i've seen the things it's like a bunch of [ __ ] metal [ __ ] tubes and pipes and you know it's not just all like water and i agree with you and you're right because it is a machine but i think that what they're trying to do but i think they're just injecting like something natural though like co2 compressed that's cold or something i don't know yeah you can do co2 extraction you know that's like one way to do it but i don't know well you'll have to you'll see you know what's crazy bro we're two dudes like [ __ ] deep in this game and we're still not a hundred percent sure yeah you know what i'm saying it's like some a newbie like [ __ ] dude what like yeah i i don't really buy those unless i'm like trying to be like super low-key and like well you got you got plans you got you got all your [ __ ] ready to go this is true buzz that mary jane i we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts never heard a show as good as this yeah number one it's the best

pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over

"lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you and i'll catch you on the next video here on true buds tv yeah this is true buzz that mary j now we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session yeah true love for my true buzz light it up and i'm on it this vibe take me way back screaming i got five on it in the cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "pW66iiVNJtY": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I wanted to talk to you guys about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I thank you guys for listening today you know you can shoot some comments below or shoot us an email give us a call if you have questions we're happy to help and we've got a large staff that can that can help you guys out and thanks for watching the video appreciate it [Music]", "grbMuzo9DW4": "is going on guys it's your boy gurney thank you very much for tuning back into the channel and if you guys do not subscribe please do so now you'll then get notified of all the videos i'm dropping i got a big dispensary haul coming up i'm going to hit the dispensary tomorrow i got a pile of stuff ordered a mountain of stuff for edibles all sorts of stuff so anyways uh yeah please subscribe to the channel and today guys we are getting into agrikind you see i got my shirt on they sent me this shirt they were sending patient shirt shirts quite a while ago um and i was lucky enough to get one got some buttons some magnets and some little uh notepads from them as well but in today's video this is uh pretty cool here i'm a big cartridge fan and today we are getting into this first agricutting cartridge i've had and um it just says rainmaker vape cart there on the front but what you want to see here is right there this is a liquid sugar cartridge so i emailed agrikind messaged agrikind whatever you want to call it and uh ask them so what are these liquid sugar cartridges you know because there's a lot of controversy on the in the pa medical marijuana market as to like the way some companies label cartridges like or is it accurate the way they're labeling them you know some call things live resins that might not really be live resins you know so i was interested to hear what they'd say and ask them what different parts they make at agra kind and all and uh the answer that i got this liquid sugar cartridge so this is cool i was hoping this was the answer it's exactly what it sounds like it is so i'm going to open this up so you guys can see but um so it's called the liquid sugar cartridge so that's what it is now me i like to get into the geeky parts of it and know exactly what's going on and all and um so what this is what they do is now look they put that little hybrid sticker on it there if you guys can see and we'll take a look and see what type of cartridge it is but um so what was i saying so oh yeah the liquid sugar so it's just all that this is is decarb wax decarb sugar so decarb concentrate what decarb means is decarboxylate it and that means like when you heat up the uh the oil or the weed or whatever to a certain temperature for a certain amount of time and it turns the thc a molecules into thc molecules so thca is not like as available as thc is so um yeah they decarb it um because here i'll show you is what look here's an agrikind sugar right here i hope i'm not all over the place and i hope you guys are following um i gotta understand just because i am understanding this like i know you guys completely some people might not and i'm not explaining this perfectly by any means i am learning right along with you guys but i'm doing my best to you know just be uh honest and informative here and show you guys what you're actually getting so this here is agrikind kosher kush sugar i'm gonna do a review on this for you guys i got this with the liquid sugar cartridge but the reason that i'm showing you this here is because that's agriculture and sugar there and then here's agri-kind's liquid sugar cartridge so i'm going to take that little hybrid thing off of the cartridge here so that you guys can see how this is filled and all and then i'm going to throw it on the uh my uni and we're going to uh give it a try the strain so it is 74 thc and then eight and a half percent thc a there's a little bit of terpenes in it one point four percent limonene 1.3 mercene and one percent cario so it has three terpenes over one percent let me show it to you guys here so you get a proper look at it i hope you guys can see that so it is a really light colored oil okay like it almost looks like it's just distillate you know but they said that it's just decarb sugar so they took that sugar i showed you they heated it it uh it bubbles and all and then after a certain amount of time they're professionals they know what they're doing it becomes like a more viscous consistency and then you're able to i guess they were able to add it to cartridges i know when i just decarb sugar myself here at the house i can't just draw it up and put it right into a cartridge i have to add like terpenes to it you can purchase or wax liquidizer that you can buy they cut it with different things so i'm interested they're saying that it just decarb wax but i wonder how they were able to get it to stay this consistency to get it in the cartridge that stuff's very interesting to me but um you see how light this oil is here okay so i showed you how light colored that oil is you saw look at this concentrate from agra kind so that's a darker one okay it's like it's not super dark but you see so i i would think like um that if they decarb that that the oil would be darker from that one you just saw but then it made me think now look at if they're taking concentrates like this here this uh i don't know how well you can see that in it but this was really really white at one point um it kind of darkened up a little bit this is some pandora's box crumble from them and it was super white when i first got it so i'm thinking maybe they're taking like their concentrates that are like crc'd like the color remediation technology that they use um i'm wondering if they take those concentrates possibly and then cook them down like i said decarboxylate them and then make this oil but either way that's my silly science lesson for the day and i probably didn't do too good with it but i did my best you know if you guys did have any questions on decarboxylation or you know anything that i was just explaining you guys can leave it in the comments or follow me on instagram my dms are always open over there it is at pa underscore gurney and i will put a a graphic up for you guys and yeah it's gurney like the the stretcher thingy you know in the hospital gurney it's pretty easy but this is a uh jupiter c cell cartridge that's the the brand i don't know if you guys are going to be able to see that on the bottom there now to me a cartridge a cartridge aficionado i i like uh the jupiter c cells they just hit really good and um i know prime uses them but uh anyways we're going to i'm going to turn on my uni here and what i did is i screwed the bottom attachment from the uni on and then you just drop it in there like that and let's see cheers wow it hits like a mack truck like i'm telling you these jupiter c cell cartridges wow not much flavor at all i'm not gonna lie it is it's almost flavorless i'm shocked i'm shocked with this terpene percentage actually guys 1.4 limonene 1.2 mercedes 1.0 cario it's not crazy terpy like i have uh my here's some pharmaceutical rx cartridges right here truly funky has 6.7 terpenes in it and this chem four one two nine percent terpene so i mean there's probably only about four percent in this one i'd say it has a um a real clean flavor to it let me try it again i still the little one guys i honest to god i can barely even like tell you like what i'm tasting i don't know am i sick am i getting sick or something i don't know but i i'm not getting much flavor off of that guys it is um it hits you in the chest though like that good feeling it um it reminds me of a uh like pharmaceutical rx makes the delta nine cartridges and delta eight cartridges like i'm feeling the effects coming on down the effects are nice i'm feeling that for sure for sure because i only did one dab since i'm home from work tonight um right before this video some african tie but uh i can feel this chilling me out for sure so that's a positive but yeah in the flavor department guys it's somewhat lacking it really is and something that always interests me because you know the cartridges they they say that they wick like it could sit on the shelf and by the time you get it maybe three months later it might look a little less filled because some of the oil absorbs into the inner part of the cart you can't see it then but it looks under filled this one was like filled with a tippy tippy top but what i'm getting at is when you take a big hit then like little bubbles pop out of the uh the ports right here and that's like you could see how much oil you're using up based on like the little bubble that comes out you know i hope i'm making sense but uh one difference i do want to show you guys here this is this is an interesting difference i have a cresco live resin here okay and then i have uh the agrikind so i got both of these here now look at the mouthpieces hopefully you guys can see that but the agrikind one is really really narrow and small and the cresco one you see is a little wider so not a huge difference but something i thought i'd point out to you guys so i'm gonna wrap this video up here i guess guys because i mean there's really not much else to be said about it it's uh the effects seem solid flavor i mean honestly it reminds me of a a distillate cart um i paid how much did i pay for this was it it was 60 and i got a discount so 51 so i think for that price i think it is a little high priced it's kind of like uh reminds me of like um a distillate cartridge that's that's what it reminds me of and i mean that in like a good way you know distillate has its place absolutely i did expect a little more flavor from the cartridge um but maybe that's just this strain you know it could just be the rainmaker strain i'm not sure or maybe i'm getting sick i don't know people might tell me i'm crazy that cartridge tasted great i don't know but to me it doesn't taste all that great and i know for sure like this kosher kush sugar oh my god it tastes amazing and there's uh less terps in this than there is in this cart so it's odd it's odd to me oh there's a funk a funk going on with the rainmaker i'd say like um i don't know the lineage or any genetics in it or anything but um it's funny i pulled out that pandora's box over there and it um that pandora's box had a funk to it man but uh with this flavor-wise they'd say minor bits of funk with uh that distillatey like not i won't say uh is it like chemically i don't know maybe you could say that but um not in a bad way uh yeah if i was rating this on a one to ten scale just to put it real simple for you guys i'd give it a seven if that makes sense on a cartridge scale you know my favorite cartridge of all time being a 10 i'd put this just right about at a seven not horrendous not anything amazing would i buy it again i think i would um if i could get it for about 50 or lower i think 60 dollars too much i'd like to pay right around 40 bucks for this i think that'd be fair 40 bucks for this i think it'd be right on the money so thank you agrikind um for the meds it's always good um always solid people and thank you for getting back to me like that uh so that i can you know come on here and not sound like a lunatic giving crazy information to the patients so uh yeah solid cartridge guys i hope you are having a a good night all this election madness going on and uh oh if you need any uh dabbing supplies anything like that we're doing a giveaway right now over at the dabbing specialists forgot to tell you is my sponsors stupid me but uh this like this rig right here is from them this is from them if you guys watches know um but we're doing a rig giveaway right now and all you have to do is go over to their instagram account the dabbing specialist or dabbing warehouse go over to instagram and you can learn how to enter you just have to subscribe to their youtubes follow

out there sorry i get all geeked out i think that rainmaker's hitting me man that rainmaker's alright and in the effects department but uh look at this for the terp meter i took the little that part off of the terpene and i put it look at that it fits like a glove in there so i got this dab tool stand from the dabbing specialist this thing's like 14 bucks 13 i think with the code it'll be like 10. you can put iso in there you could throw your bubble cap on there i mean you could throw q-tips in there you got the dab tool thing or like i said all my terp meter people look at this you drop it in there i set it there like that and now look my freaking thing hits it perfect gives me a reading so i'm done selling this anyways i don't need to sell you as you just can see i've been using this stuff long before the dabbing specialist came along and uh decided to uh do this venture with me so you guys know you can look back at my videos i just use good stuff that functions well on this evan shorebanger didn't get that from the dabbing specialist but it's my banger and i love it so anyways this rainmaker got me ranting and i'm gonna stop while i'm ahead have a good one guys i deeply

men lived in this home and were renting it and they're surprised to hear what was happening inside cash guns pot and fifty five thousand dollars worth of cartridges containing THC the main compound in marijuana that gets you high this is what MCS OHS drug suppression task force seized from inside this home north of carefree highway and east of 27th Drive last week Thursday I'm just blown away that it happened here today neighbors were too shocked to talk on camera just a really quiet very friendly neighborhood I think the thing that we learned is this kind of thing can happen anywhere you know this can happen in any neighborhood deputies arrested Tucker Reis and Colby Stevens both 23 years old the two are accused of manufacturing the illegal vape cartridges the same kind found throughout the US and linked with recent vaping deaths Sheriff Paul Penn's own says he's not surprised I'm more so concerned and that's what this is right now we see the deaths across the country and in different forms because of things are being ingested he expects more busts like this one to happen because demand for the product is so high we can't wait for this become an epidemic problem we need

give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "KslGabh50gI": "what's up guys welcome back i realized i really never actually introduced myself maybe a few times but my name is alina for those of you who don't know today i'm going to show you guys how you can eat the oil in your carts or how you can use it in edibles i'm going to show you guys how to make butter infused butter with your carts it's very easy once you get the distillate out of the carts you can use it in many different ways such as just plain straight up eating it adding it to butter you can also use it in quite a few different recipes i do have a few on my channel that i think it would go very well with such as adding it to oreos or to dummies um i'll post the links of some suggested edible videos for you guys to make below and check those out you can use the oil in most of the carts at least the ones that are distilled which if you're getting them from dispensary that's what they should be if they're ordered online it's hard for us to really know um i tried one of or some of the oil from one of mine that i ordered online and i'll show you guys the clip here of me um trying it and it really worked just straight up eating it even just a little bit of it i'm also going to show you guys in this video how to add oil to butter so you guys can have infused butter that way and in this case you guys don't need to decarb or anything like that because the thc is already activated when i show you guys how to make the butter with the oils in the cart you could also do the same thing with purchase the salad so in any recipe where it calls for half a cup of infused butter a quarter cup of whatever amount of infused butter if you don't have that infused butter that was made the traditional method you could also just add distillate to butter which is what i'm going to show you guys how to do in this video so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass today i will be showing you how to use carts and edibles or how to um just straight up eat them slash what happens when so um i have a bunch of miscellaneous cards i have um some that i ordered online a long time ago um and then i have some that are from dispensaries um and i don't really want to vape the ones that i got online i just don't know if i really trust them anymore i even have like um a whole full one that i'm probably just gonna eat somehow um but yeah so what i wasn't sure about is they should all be distilled and they definitely will be um the ones i'm getting from the dispensary i definitely know are with one's online i'm not so sure um but it's like a 95 chance that the cards that you have are just phillip um but that's what this method i'm going to show you guys is for and if it's a different type i don't um i can't confirm that it would work the same one thing i wanted to try is if i would eat some of the liquid what would happen um and i did that a few days ago i recorded it and i'll put that in here and i'll show you guys exactly what happens okay so i have one of my cards here which is mostly empty and i'm going to um consume it i don't know how much i'll see how much i can get out um and we're going to see if this is going to do anything because i don't know if i need to heat them up first for them to work or if they're just gonna um work on their own so instead of trying to just figure it out because like i said i bought these online and i don't actually know how legit they are um so we're just gonna try it and we're gonna we're gonna see if that works i'm going to i couldn't unscrew this by hand so i'm just using um a rubber glove for a little bit of grip or this isn't rubber i don't know what this is called but and then um these for some more grip and that comes off pretty easy i think yeah so there's that [Music] i guess i should turn this right here [Music] um i'm just trying to see if i can pull this thing out okay i think what i should do is put this in some i'm gonna put this in a cup of hot water first so that the uh liquid will warm up and kind of i'm just gonna place it like um this direction so when i take it off the liquid will be down here okay so i have a i just have a shot glass that i put um i filled with hot water from the top and i'm gonna place this in here um like this so that um the water will heat it up and it'll drop to the bottom where i need to access it from so i'm just popping that in there and i just made sure that there was enough water to actually cover um all the way up to here so i had to fill it up pretty high and then i figured this was probably going to cool off pretty fast so i got another bowl of just some water that i put in the microwave for about 30 seconds and i'm gonna place this into the bowl to kind of like just keep the water warm and i'm just gonna check on it every so often and then um put warmer water in there although it's already dropping down so we might not even need to change that so yeah i'm just gonna leave this here for a few minutes okay so i had to warm up the water once through this whole thing it took about like 20 minutes for it to um melt so there it is there's still a little bit there but i'll just dig it out okay so i'm just gonna dry this off there we go and then coming undone there okay so i'm just gonna use this toothpick to to get it out i'm just gonna straight up like eat it [Music] it doesn't taste bad it doesn't really taste like anything i hope this works so yeah i'm just scraping it out with a toothpick it's a little bitter and then i'm going to take a lecithin pill and i usually just take these when i take edibles just because it helps a little bit so this is how much is left in here and i'm gonna get the rest of that out which i got almost like i consumed almost all of it but the little bits they're sticking to the side i'm gonna get out when i um get the rest of all of my cartridges like when i do the whole thing which is this what this video is for um but yeah so it is 3 13 so 3 o'clock and i will report back and see if this works or if it does absolutely nothing and i'm really hoping that it works because it's gonna be so much simpler to utilize these carts um if i don't have to deal with heating them up and making sure that all goes smoothly but yeah so i'll be back in a few hours so it's been it's five o'clock so i don't know two hours oh my it worked for sure um i think it's just you know when you take some edibles and you're like oh they're not working i should take some more and then you take more and then you're like oh my god i shouldn't have taken more that's how i feel right now my mouth is so dry so dry and some juice um sorry yeah it definitely worked and i don't know how much stronger and how much more it's gonna kick in like for how long for but i can't even think straight but um this is like really good because and i didn't smoke any weed today at all the only thing i consumed along those lines was that um little cart thing so because i wanted to be sure about it like i was tempted to still hit the pen but i was like i want to be sure that if i feel something i know it's from the pen but yeah okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna reflect back more on this when i'm in another in a better state in the video part next okay okay bye oh gosh i'm so chill very very guys this hits hard okay i feel like i could have taken less you know just be careful with how much you take i think it's a very good amount that i took i think hopefully it's snowing outside also which is insane [Music] october and freezing too so yeah as we see clearly it worked very well i actually was licking some earlier and i shouldn't have because i have to make sure what i'm doing is correct and even just a little bit of it like works very well and i find i have a pretty high tolerance for edible so i was surprised how little of it it took for it to have a strong effect i'm gonna try this one that was broken i'm just gonna like lick whatever is left off of there so i was just playing around with my cartridges to see how to open each one and i was going to open this one and when i was using the pliers to turn it it wasn't i'm turning up here so i decided to put um this onto the glass part in turn and even just a little bit of pressure and it completely shattered so just an fyi when you guys are trying to figure out how to open your carts don't put your pliers directly on the glass i know it's common sense but i still did it so just fyi i don't know if we'll be able to salvage any of this i'll see what i can do but i don't really wanna end up putting a lot of glass in my mouth okay so with the broken one it's not really there's so much glass on it so i don't really know how else to use it so i'm gonna try adding it to this pipe that already has like some stuff in there it's mostly burnt um i'm gonna try and melt this into here and i don't care if there's a little bit of glass in there um because that's fine i'll just throw it out after um so let's see if this works i'm just gonna use a blow dryer to melt this off of here okay so with just using um a little bit of the blow dryer already started to kind of melt off so i'm gonna just yeah see it's a little sticky just try and like push that off into there so there's the glass in there and it was honestly very difficult to get the rest of the oil out of the cart so i kind of think you just kind of have to go with whatever chunks of broken cart you have and just kind of throw them in there so when i light this i'm just going to light it pretty much just like on the like around the glass like on the other side of it just kind of heat it up and then yeah i'm just going to hit that this looks sketchy as heck oh i got quite a bit out of that okay so let's just take a look at it after it's been smoked yeah it all came off pretty well with just a couple hits so your first step is to figure out um where your wear slash how your cards open so for a lot of them i find um you can twist them off by hand at least the ones i ordered online i find if you have um some grip just this glove here yeah now i can't open it once the camera's on okay there we go so yes that comes out um so just figure out where your cards open i assume they should all be on the top but i can't guarantee you want to put the cart so that wherever they open which for me is the tops of them um is on the bottom so that when all the liquid melts down when we open it it'll be easy to access okay so i just had a bowl of um hot water here and then a shot glass michael jackson and i'm gonna fill up that um shot glass with that hot water and then put it in the bowl with hot water to keep it nice and warm now i'm gonna take my cards and place them um with the tip up so that the distillate will fall to the tip which is where i want it to go and i'm actually just going to pour out enough water so that the um water isn't going into the the uh the part that gets screwed in but just enough to keep most of the distillate warm so it can melt properly and then we're just going to wait for this and as it cools down i'll just reheat it or add um more hot water until all of the liquid in the carts fall down which i think will take about 10 minutes ish okay so the water that i used was not warm enough so you want to make sure this water is really hot almost boiling but not boiling um and then it should take about 10 minutes so there's a couple ways you can consume these and the first would be just straight up eating it so let's start with this cartridge here i'm just gonna dry that off and then i'm gonna twist it open [Music] okay so there is our oil i'm just gonna lick this right off here and because it's really warm it came off really easily super easy to get off and then for the rest of this i'm just gonna take a toothpick and do that and then i'm just going to eat it right off the toothpick and then repeat those steps until i have ate all of this little bit of oil in here it doesn't taste the best it's not gonna lie i find that um oops the um the ones from the dispensaries taste a little better than the ones that i ordered online okay so i got pretty much everything i can get out of this one you can either throw this away or you can refill it with some more distillate and another way to eat it is similar to just eating it but if you kind of want to avoid the taste and are looking for something easy i suggest using oreos now yes these are oreo minis but you could use whatever oreos you like this is just what i had at home so i'm gonna get another cartridge here let's pull up this one isn't that beautiful that's one nice thing about getting your carts from the dispensary they're just much nicer looking much nicer looking and this one here is my favorite it's called spinach and the top part that you uh the mouthpiece it actually moves around let's see if you guys can see that see so yeah most of them don't do that so i really like that okay now we're going to open this one and i need to dry that off again too this one is a lot harder to open and while i'm doing this i'm just tasting the one that i had in my mouth and honestly it leaves a pretty gross taste i don't really love that but if you eat something else that's thick it'll probably um disguise it oh my goodness i could not get this open this is going to be an issue i have a feeling because these are from dispensaries it might be what the heck am i tightening it the wrong way so i really cannot get this one open i don't know what it is so i'm just gonna set it back and i think i'm just gonna break into it um to get the rest of the distillate out but for these oreos i'm gonna use this one to show you guys so it seems like the ones from like i said the ones from the um when you order them online or off the block market or whatever these are very easy to unscrew um but the ones from dispensaries not as much kind of makes sense because they're probably trying to avoid you from using them over again so yeah i'm just again gonna um look whatever's left off here tastes horrible i mean it's not that bad i'm being so dramatic okay and then i'm going to um use the toothpick i just have a fresh toothpick here to get the rest of this out okay so i'll just take that um right out of there and i'm gonna put it right into the middle of my little oreo and close that and then that is good to eat and i'll do the same with the other oreo here and you can put as much or as little as you want oh look at that one right here this one is made to put a whole bunch in there and guys i'm not serving these to people so don't don't be saying how nasty this this looks or is because i'm just eating it myself and then the cooler this gets the harder it's going to be get um to get out so work fast um or just put the screw the lid back on and put it back in some hot water but yeah we got most of that out okay so there's one way to do that and then the other is if you want to um use your carts in anything um that would usually require a infused butter or oil you can do that with this so here i have some melted butter this is just regular butter and then i melted it um and then i'm going to directly add my carts right into here and mix all together i'm also going to add some lecithin in here which is going to help bind the butter to the distillate as well as help our bodies absorb the thc i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own and the specific amount doesn't really matter i probably put more than i needed in there but oh well so we're going to add in our carts and all we're going to do is just scrape them into here and mix it really well and then you can use this butter in any recipe that calls for infused butter so the ratios doesn't really matter if you want to put 10 carts in here go put 10 cards if you want to do one cart just do one cart and then say you wanted to make brownies and your brownies call for half a cup of infused butter you can use half a cup of your infused butter so this is really it essentially is the same thing as if you were to add the cart directly to a um say like a batch of brownies but the thing is it would be very hard to distribute that little bit of distillate throughout the whole brownie so by putting it into the butter we're able to get the butter to go throughout all of the brownies instead of just working with you know this much liquid we're working with this much or more so now let's add these ones and so because there's such little left in these in order for me to show you guys how i would actually do this slash how you guys should do this i'm gonna um use this full cart that i haven't used yet and like i said i don't want to use the one i don't want to um inhale the ones that i had ordered online back before so this is a good way to use it so i just heated up a cup of water in the microwave it's almost boiling but not and this came in a package i'm just going to put it right in there and let it actually i'm going to turn it around so that we have the bottom going in first so we can melt this liquid a little bit more so it'll be easier to pour into our butter so i'm going to leave that in there um for a few minutes i just got a comment and say be careful because i've been licking these and like the toothpick and stuff and it gets hitting me hard and i don't know i know i should stop but for the video you know i just want to taste like icings i think i got some oreo icing in it but be careful with how much you use okay this has been been in here for about like five minutes so it should be oh my god it's so hot okay so it should be good if you don't have it doesn't come in one of these bags which i know most don't just put it in a little plastic baggie to be honest it's probably fine to go in without anything but i mean why not use a bag isn't this packaging super cute i love these ones but i don't know i feel weird about using the ones online so i'm just going to open that because i gotta dry it off again there's our brand new cart and i'm gonna open um this part right here and then we're gonna pour all this liquid into our butter that's been melted so this should come out pretty easily because um it was in the hot water melting yeah you can see we got most of that out already okay and then whatever is left which there isn't much um i guess we'll just use a toothpick to get that out but you could use a blow dryer too to kind of push it down but yeah that came out really easy and it was only in the hot water for um like three or four minutes and you know i really don't like the taste of the back of all this like in the back of my throat like as i'm doing this because i've been eating like eating a little bits throughout and it just does not taste good so i really think it'd be nicer with the oreos and stuff so that you can kind of have something i don't know so it doesn't have to like line your mouth and throat it can just go right into your stomach and see now i have um it's all over this and i can't get that into the butter so i'm just gonna have to like suck this off of the toothpick how delicious okay this one doesn't taste as bad kind of tastes like lip gloss cool so now that we have um that poured in we're just gonna mix it into this butter and it's fruit punch flavored flavored i guess scented no i don't know i'm not sure but it doesn't really taste like fruit punch it does when you inhale it but the actual oil doesn't so that mixed in very very well and at this point you can just put it in the fridge and it's good to use in your recipes a nice easy infused butter i think i'm going to um scrape out the rest of my three cartridges and put them in here but because there's such little left in here it might be best to just um scrape it out with a toothpick and just kind of like eat it directly off not right now because honestly i've had too much and i can already tell it's like i'm going down a bad road with how much i've had and it hasn't even been that much but i still have to make dinner and stuff so i got to be capable of doing all that and i don't know about you guys but the one thing that i need to realize i shouldn't do when i'm high is cook because every time i cook when i'm high i mess something up and i'm not type person who usually messes things up when i cook but oh my goodness the nastiest the most gross dish i've ever made or the only like really bad dish the grossest dish i ever made was when i was high it was just i was making oh i don't want to tell you guys it was so gross but yeah so for these cards that i can't open i think i'm just going to straight up break them and do that to get the oil out um so yeah let's try that please tell me if there's a better way to open these because i feel like there must be something or i am just a major weakling and i can't open them i'm just gonna get this out of the way i'm gonna oh god how should i do this i think i'm just gonna like smack it with this oh god i'm so scared yeah okay what the heck there we go okay so i broke that there's the oil and then like i said we could put this without the sticker in um a pipe and use that because it'd be too hard to scrape this off i don't know how many times i'm going to tell you but it really does not taste good in in the mouth i need to go eat something like chewy to get get rid of the taste okay so these pieces i feel like need to go into the pipe so i'll put those there so we got all that there and then i'm gonna get my pipe this honestly feels like the most sketchy ghetto thing ever like literally smoking pieces of glass just be careful if you guys are gonna do this i'm assuming everybody is a grown up with a fully developed brain don't hurt yourself okay and then i'm literally going to smoke this these pieces of glass like a huge sketchy person but it works it really does work surprisingly now we got my glass that i'm about to hit okay let's do this yeah something's sparked so it's just like should i continue doing this you know what i don't suggest smoking the glass okay i did it if you choose to do it it wasn't me who's recommending it so just keep that in mind because that was a little bit sketchy and like what if you lit it up and then uh like glass sparked into your eye you know what i mean okay i'm so scared something's gonna hit my eyes let me just i'm still gonna do it even though i don't suggest it but just give me one second i'm back and i'm protected and i'm ready to try this again actually one second okay now that i got my personal protective equipment i think i'm ready to try this again i'm gonna get rid of that one with a little bit of something else on there i think it was like a sticker or something and let me just yeah there's still a little more there okay very fruit punch not really under the sea under the sea darling gets better down where it's wetter take it from me so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass but yeah i took the glass out not a good idea don't do it i mean you can but i do not suggest i'm good [Music] too um um yes thank you guys again very much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and i apologize if it's all over the place because i'm a little high right now but when i wanted to show you guys in the last like 20 minutes i had let this butter sit out when i was [Music] smoking i don't know what i was doing and this is what it looks like just so you guys can kind of see it has stayed um emulsified uh you guys can't see that too well can you there you go so yeah that's how the butter looks a little a little weird-ish texture but yeah that is just regular unsalted butter one cart and some lecithin mixed it and i'm just gonna go store this in the fridge and then i'm gonna use it maybe to make um some toast tonight perhaps okay guys so to summarize a few different ways we put our distillate directly into our oreos just open them up rub some onto the frosting we melted some butter and poured in some warmed up distillate mixed it together with a little bit of lecithin i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own but if you find that you're mixing it together and it's not mixing just put it in the fridge go buy some lecithin and you can always add it later it's not going to hurt anything to add it um a little bit later instead of at the same time thank you guys so much for watching this video i apologize if i am being a little bit confused in any of the video because i've been needing the oil the whole time and it's just like it's hit me and i also was smoking my glass so that hit me real hard um as well speaking of which i do have the rest of mine that i'm going to hit right now but thank you guys very much for watching i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a comment give it a thumbs up and subscribe you", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments below to spread the knowledge make sure to be in touch with us on social media on instagram at vape honey stick and official vape honey stick make sure to use my special promo code honey 420 if you want to pick up any of our tanks that we've picked out to sell to you or our cool batteries or lots of other cool items make sure to be in touch with us like this video stay tuned stay lifted and I'll see you next time", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure

tuning in until next time", "zwhc8vEiV9w": "welcome to a community cannabis review today I'm gonna be making a quick little video nothing too in-depth I mean making a video on a brand of concentrates and cartridges we have here in Oregon called hush brand they're a very very low end bottom shelf here's the sticker that I was able to take off see that $16.66 that's med taxable Eve's like 20% here so comes off to $20 out the door for these cartridges this is a package you can you get them with I get with them rather hard to see towards detail there might be able to focus it perfect so I used to not get these because from I I could have sore they used to use non cannabis derive terpenes which I am NOT a fan of I don't trust them personally but ever since I want to say about like six months ago there was a nationwide and Oregon also had its own flavouring band for vaporizers and this also covered cannabis products as well apparently so ever since that happened you have a couple brands that were lower end but I usually didn't get like hush Mojave because from what I knew they used non cannabis derived terpenes it's not the case anymore so these are I'm gonna give them an another try to see what I think this is UK cheese how it comes well pretty standard card packaging they're got a rubber caps on these end up it in the vessel when I started on two point seven volts it's a really nice flavor kind of neutral it nothing stands out really but it's very nice I don't know if that's true that UK cheese I've only had one cheese straighten and it wasn't UK cheese but it does taste like that strain I will get at that I didn't expect the terpenes to be on point but I really think they might be no bad I'm gonna bump it up to I believe 3.7 volts now give it one last hit if I can get my vessel to work there we are I don't know how to work this thing sometimes I mean that's a great taste I'm really surprised for 15 16 dollars for a gram that's really nice it's surprisingly nice so calm I'm gonna do another one of these videos here in a second on Mojave this is a live resin cart that well you know I'll get to that in the video so hope to see you on that video and I'll see you next time on community cannabis review", "0CIgYyCFgco": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in respectmyregion.com here today with a quick taste test review featuring jazzasaurus butt tender from mother nature's remedy in woodland hills and the buddies brand cannabis distillate with cannabis derived terpenes vape cartridge so we'll be doing a review on this vape on the buddy's brand seesaw so today's strain is the three bears og this is an indica it's one that i personally am a fan i'm a fan of i've tried it in the live resin form i've tried it in the dab form but i have not tried it in the dissonance so i haven't tried this either um 91.98 total chem cannabinoids eighty-eight point fifty percent thc zero cbd and it has beta-mercing beta-carothylene [Music] we'll see okay i like these chirps i think i'm gonna like this one should be good three bears og pop it on open let's see what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes comes from cannabis not some kind of all-natural or fruit or veggies or something like that three four second hit what are you tasting it was something sweet and earthy i don't know i really like it oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth trying doesn't taste good and giving you guys a score to kind of stay consistent with so appreciate you guys for the love we'll see you all in the next review love y'all peace", "BQgkVTCGKAg": "[Music] oh man got a full house alright sorry guys what's up sausage gravy biscuit glad grower forgot my ashtray got burned down with you guys make it some vape cards this morning testing them on yep being down at the dispensary cuz they ain't making them clean yet like uncle Harley so here's what I've been doing I made up my little necks I put my live rosin I decarboxylated it and my decarboxylate er see this now it's not rapid led it's ardent this is my D cardi carved the rosin and then I winterized it for a second that didn't really pull anything off so I just then I warmed it back up and cut it with this is what I cut it with little yellow bus honey liquidize oh come on these gaskets man they need oiled right off the get sometimes yeah these things are a pain and I'll ask so just use a little residual [ __ ] left over and oil the gaskets with it like that there's always a little stuck on the tip you gotta get one of these little blunt tip needles once you suck it up in your syringe this syringe was full they got a squirt in slow the D carbs the color it makes it dark I don't give a [ __ ] this cuz I know these pens don't get up to know 436 degrees my nicotine pen don't get up that high so I don't think you're really getting in those other pens I don't think you're really flashing that [ __ ] off it's not D carbon even says it's THC a you're not getting at all let's put it that way you're gonna get all of it miss it's gonna feel stronger even though the THC contents probably lower I'm guessing this morning 50 60 % maybe 70 I only cut it a third and use half well it's like a half half of what's there like I had 8 grams of live rosin and I used 4 milliliters of little yellow bus honey liquidizer there we go clean vape cartridge was all ready to hit that's shocking I didn't think they'd do that the librarians real thick and sticky you'd never even be able to get it in here right unless you like heated it up and then put it in scold him hot and then then did it but then it wouldn't burn it wouldn't even drain down anything so you have to like make liquidize it so that's an emulsifier it's flour terpenes right you can actually buy straight cannabis terpenes but they are unbelievably expensive you ain't gonna buy now 120 milliliters of it for you know 100 some dollars it's gonna be [ __ ] the one Scott has it's goddamn it [ __ ] gasket there you get like three drops for 20 bucks literally the actual cannabis terpenes that their wildly expensive I could see why you know your yields are just probably all the guy got off one freakin plan if you watch that in dokas channel at all Howie he always tries to show you how to make concentrates with a coffeepot and he they make excellent CBD products too by the way but they're I think they're in Europe sorry I gotta pay attention one doing I forgot what I'm saying that's how good that glue pen is I'm not a big favor either UK but you know anymore even though it's all legal and stuff here there's still a huge stigma so people love the stealth of the vape pen they're like man that could be at a family function I could literally walk outside for two seconds nobody knows I did [ __ ] and I could put up with their [ __ ] for another two hours yeah I'm almost out of juice I think that's about it I just might fill up this one I got here about last a little bit it's getting thick that's not good trick is go slow so yeah once you get your harvest alive rise and then after I harvested out the decarboxylate er I I warm it up in the microwave for 30 seconds inside this thing and then you then I measure out this little yellow bus honey liquidizer in the pen right and I like if first you got to make sure you you know your weight so my weight was like seven point nine right at eight so I use just under four milliliters of the little yellow bus honey liquidiser it come out almost perfect it was a little bit thick but I just didn't want to add any more so what's happening aap it's having to Jane joke grows that do a little work this morning getting these vape cards ready before I headed to the post office got packages going out today maybe these are gonna be better I don't know if you got any of these or not sausage these are definitely gonna be Wow way better it was taking me five polls to really feel it now I'm feeling that wanting to just like it's a yeah dee carbonate makes a huge difference wow that feels like it's twice as strong I love that glue it tastes just like gorilla glue to using this yeah I used to no flavor original orig sup j420 you came for 20 I know I said something to you already buddy and shout you out with a mess aap glad you still up in here I found your big bud see that I popped and then I hid my panty dropper with it so we collaborated on the string you didn't even know it what do you want to call the big panty dropper there's granny panties and then we got panty dropper we could have big-girl panties you know ladies they put your big-girl panties on here's what I done so far today these are all complete liquid gold so it looks like we don't make [ __ ] well once people taste my weed in there and they always oh man how much do some of that bud these are clean Jane no lead right because we don't use shitty coils no uh no vitamin E no coconut oil no butane harvested [ __ ] weed not washed with nothing no propane no MXZ 12 12 X or whatever it is MZ 12 X all we use is little yellow bus honey live liquidizer and live rosin I don't know if you guys have a pricey live rosin carts out but a real live rosin cart is not cheap a piece of email me the PayPal me the shipping I'll send you it to you something I say I send you something for your giveaway too I'll send you one of my earlier prototypes the one right before this fall harvest man I just put that grill glue into flour this morning nice she's gonna be nice so here's how we make our s oh I'll just do a quick tutorial and I'll do a whole other video when I actually make it so you got to get you one of these from Amazon you can get them anywhere between 40 and a hundred bucks and I'll tell you the price difference why I got what I got this is a counter top distiller okay see it plugs up the top part plugs into the back and then the back part plugs into the wall right it's got this digital temperature readout setting things this is a this is really handy I mean you can boil it off outside but it gets dangerous when you do that [ __ ] this is highly flammable liquid I mean you can light it on fire it's been this is what they the s alcohol is no joke this I have to pick up in Kentucky because they don't sell it high enough proof here see that that means it's 95% pure alcohol so what we do first is out pour two bottles into this right - fresh bottles pour it straight in and then I'll run it through and what that does is that flashes that most of that 5% or that yeah that 5% of water off because you don't want no water in your RSO is if you to get it evaporated off you got to get it to 212 degrees and we know that you lose your thtve at 2:15 so you don't want to do that and your THC delta-9 so then here's some alcohol that's come off the RSO already see it comes back I use this because that shit's not cheap that bottle is 50 bucks are you doing a gallon at a time you know you just flashed it otherwise if you don't have one of these you just flashed it off into the atmosphere and you're gonna get about 10 15 milliliters IRS oh maybe yeah so these are the setup fits together and then you're gonna make your distillate pour it in here set your temperature to 78 to 79 degrees centigrade okay that's where alcohol boils off I don't know what the Fahrenheit equivalent is because nobody uses that where they make these I guess so but they do list you know the alcohol flash off what these are made for is there wine distiller to turn wine into brandy right so or to clean your water up what's everybody saying my chest not scrolling anymore we got more than 14-inch at how's what tastes frosty the hybrid are the vape cartridge this one tastes just like real glue number four no [ __ ] I was like hell yeah to come from live rosin this shit's good it tastes like the live rosin it's real smooth this little tiny thing I'd give one of these kind of volt that's what I've been using or use you want to use our kind of vape cars head our airflow is the same as just about everybody else Platinum vape and all them you need a battery with let me see see how it's got these little notches for air flow if you don't have that you'll never get air I mean it's all it'll seal itself right up shut because the whole see it the airflow holes right there my joints off the power all right it's back to the IRS oh alright so this is what when I say we'll put it in the still this is the still and it's nice because it's safe it can sit around your counter time you don't have to worry about blowing up your house we have known some people here in Michigan their kids were making a shatter or whatever and they blew the burn their parents house aunt killed their parents we don't want that [ __ ] to happen here's the digital readout when you start out you hit set 79 degrees and then it'll fire up on its own but we don't want to do that because there's nothing in it and it catches all the alcohol this nice little thing I think mine was like a hundred bucks your you want the one where you can adjust the temperature so I'm come in there just set to distill water and they get too hot and you cook your RSO you're not getting that that stuff to the right consistency at the very end that's what separates the the good from the okay and it's a long process and the way I do it I do it the way I do it so that so that it also D carbs in because it's an oral medication you want it to hit right now this doesn't get quite hot enough to be carbon okay you need to get it up to 200 degrees so so what I do is I get to this big old pickle jar we got you still see I didn't want this alcohol had particulate in it and I didn't want to filter it out so I'll just run wash my next batch of weed in it right so because I don't want to run it through that I just got it all cleaned out so on I grind up my weed first and I just run some [ __ ] all right here's what I do and take the weed normal that way stick in the food processor stems it off cuz it's all got medicine on it right we're not smoking it we don't care how harsh it is pack this [ __ ] nice and full you candy stem it if you want it'll blow through the processor easier but it really doesn't matter you don't have to chop it up if you good I was really grinding the [ __ ] out of it yesterday cuz I was harvesting beans at the same time this isn't seedy outdoor bud this is this is just foxtail bud [Music] [Music] and do our pickle jar got some alcohol in there yeah you're gonna want to fill it up to where it's almost it's completely saturating the cannabis right it's almost got not enough weed in it right now man where's Mook at you just want to see this oh crap I don't think I put 21 plus up first I even put all the trim and [ __ ] back in the same bag with this looks like that's gonna be hash or honest low [ __ ] floods or foxtails out so bad guys the first time grower and I think he he was worried about Ripper put a security light on them what do you think happened to him they look humongous they're foxtail all out and they're frosty is all get-out fright you know smoke your brains out but I can't do nothing with it smoke it it's getting man all right so I need material for assault worse than I need bud or smoke that's kind of blood we use Ferrari so we don't use moldy bud Japan get away with it y'all you know you just give them dead mold spores and all that sick just it just doesn't seem a that : it besides what if one's for doesn't [ __ ] die and all sudden it's gonna put off thousands and millions more so I don't think they can Hamilton quite frankly I've had this discussion with my mom and she's the smartest person I know see you later Jane thanks for stopping in it wouldn't surprise me if they did that's for sure I mean all it takes is for it to stay on an air bubble and they are microscopic so they may be able to live through the they may be able to live through the alcohol bath but they're not gonna live through the decarboxylation process of mine that kills everything everything gets dead at 165 degrees and we go over that so so just in case anything did that I didn't see or you know even survived the bud wash survived this alcohol wash it's not clear surviving my deep car process but I still will not use moldy cannabis it's just the risk outweighs the reward that's why you gotta look at don't ever look at oh I'm losing this I'm losing that you know you might lose something more important like your ability to breathe will see the [ __ ] that fell on the desk normally I fill this jar fill it full and then I'll tell you how to make it even a nice like pretty color once you get this fluid filtered out of here right if you stick that jar a full liquid in the sunshine for a few hours five six hours it will take the green color out and they'll make it a nice golden color via Charlie Jackson there's let's keep this in the smaller jars push it out of your way should sleep that passion there Jackson where'd you put grandpa's we'll do that all right so then you gotta get your pretty black hair tie that your daughter leaves laying around everywhere because she's a slob yesterday first some of the rice strainer that's right first I strain it with the rice screener because this you have to be careful unless you'd like having one of those special cone funnels we want to squeeze the alcohol out of the material if we can that way if anything spills you're not 100% after we're gonna do the race for you some guys stop here you know they don't mind a little plant matter in their RS soul but it's not just for us so I start people you know a little cleaner look in frankly I think the more [ __ ] you leave it the better that works for you but I don't like it either tastes nasty we should God you look up in the house I'll leave it up for you brother I told my girlfriend want to conserve water and stop showering you so much she told me I I don't think you have a showering problem I think you have a digging up corpses all groan oh my god it's horrible they're gonna give a little squeeze over it's just a little squeeze then we'll throw this in the trash and they'll be back to add the rest this is how we Satan on the alcohol squeeze that [ __ ] out of there oh this one fits way nicer and it's a tighter screen I like that I got an invention for this too I just come up with it yesterday Scott's gonna help we work on the prototype one thing I miss while working at GM in have it shop no more clean this bowl out there so then I like to filter eyes down a little bit more so next I grab me a coffee filter rubber band I gotta be careful with this we in a recovering alcoholic this alcohol that's so strong you really should wear rubber gloves you can literally get drunk from the [ __ ] soaking into your skin so cuz I'm hardly wants to stay on the wagon and I don't want my life to fall into shreds I'm not gonna get drunk on blue-eyes Moses today got my rubber band I got my coffee filter come on maybe I don't have my coffee filter right because I don't have on my coffee music put the coffee saucer over the jar what I just do with my rubber band I just had at the back of the tape and see what the [ __ ] I did with it Oh see I need smokes weed alright ready guys so then this is a long process cuz this [ __ ] takes forever to drain no that ain't gonna work I'm gonna fall oh my goodness sakes well because this has so much alcohol in it disinfect the st. erst okay all right I was going to leave this propped up in the corner on the desk you have to take my word for it drinking but it goes really slow there see it running down in there it's gonna take a while I had a mail this morning I had a mail from mr. green body but he told me he runs rings I like running rigs and you can see how healthy his [ __ ] is you can see the difference is it's not a big one at first but I could tell over the overall health of the plant like how well they they handle [ __ ] like right now we're doing a breeding project with some Brazil Amazonia it's supposed to be the most mold resistant strain there is I mean it fights off mold in the Amazon those kind of wet conditions cassoulet and and it's supposed to be highly pest resistant I can say it's probably the one plant in my grow area that I haven't seen any spider mite damage on whatsoever so in our p.m. that we've had like a spot here and there there's all come from the spider mite damage so it didn't get in OPM but it really hasn't been exposed to any yeah it only happens when your leaves get really damaged nice that's cool Hamilton I gotta make sure that chats still scrolling it hasn't won usually when I get more than four 14 people in there it wants to stop so so back to regs and Femmes I think just the overall health of the plant they just seemed to I don't know maybe because it's not scientifically propagated I guess but even with like even with good solid back breeding and I was listening to Vader talk about this they kept asking Vader well I don't you have feminized see why don't you have feminized seed and this he may have him now this is right before he started ocean grown or right when he started it and he said I can't get it better than ten percent female seeds and until I can get I mean ten percent Hermes or you know our males he said until I can get it better than that I don't want to say they're feminized well I mean that's what everybody else is calling from a nice seed so even at that there's a 10% chance right you can still get a male right so that means the math should be 1 out of 10 so if you're getting 2 or 3 males out of 10 the chances are you got you you might not know it but you've got red pollen from somewhere if you're in an area where somebody's grown within literally if you're outside growing if you're within two miles of somebody with a male plant outside there's a height there is a probability that your plant could get pollinated they can go up to 2 miles in the air that's another reason our area is surrounded by trees and overgrowth and [ __ ] try to filter that [ __ ] out I'm excited for that Sour Diesel means soil life we're talking about that Sour Diesel last night what would get a good run on average that shit's [ __ ] just [ __ ] because it was farm-sauce it ran yeah got pregnant I'm gonna try to run a sense of million see what happens so then after this shit's all done we put it up in our still of course with this still this big you're gonna want to make dual you know a larger quantity at a time even if you just got us save it well some guys do is they'll take their product from here from the jar and then cap it and stick it in the freezer and what that does there's all the fats and lipids that are in that mix well glob you late just like on spaghetti or chili you know you see if you leave it sit out the sauce you'll get that grease I'll come coagulate on top so then they'll filter it again and what happens and they do it through a vacuum process because it has to be quick before the fats melt back again right so then they filter it again cold filter it and then that's how you pull the fats out but once you do that boy it's really hard to work with I mean you got a harvest at all is liquid and then hope it doesn't get too hard in the syringe so I stopped I stopped winterizing the RSO for that reason it was really really strong I mean stupid strong I didn't take a single pain pill for this seven fusions I had my back my mom my mom helps her with that bad breeding stuff cuz before I started I was like nah I don't I don't understand this is Mendelian charm yeah so what that's I mean the probability I'm a math guy and it just everything's a guess you know what I mean it's like you got a mom and a dad you're gonna get brothers and sisters now you're not identical to your brothers and sisters in any way shape or form so you have to take the the biggest baddest brother or sister and sister right in this case and then you got to try to then even have to isolate her genetics so how do you do that so then you got to find a male with similar structure I've all these beans you pop and then you cross them right and then you do this five more times so breeding males males very difficult bought there's way to skip a step and this is why feminized seeds became so popular besides the fact that you have a high probability right 90% chance of getting a female say well it's actually seventy-eight percent chance you know 22 percent 28% chance 72 percent chance I'll be female the rest are gonna be Hermes er or males and that was a study if you're into Korean farming at all this Korean guy did a study where he did 300 beans and that's what the numbers he came up with and he did it like more than once so he said that's the you know that was the probability so so it'd mean breeding is never an exact science right it never but if I would say if you're unsure whether or not things were I check all my beans anyway because you don't know I mean you could get powned from outside blow in the window and hit your plant and you get some beans that came from somebody else's mail who knows just keep checking your sacks it's not that difficult you guys behave c'mon I had a feeling one of them mr. greenbags was gonna be a boy the way that [ __ ] was ahead and I was like come on girl but I did pop pop too because the regs in the math you know the math doesn't always come out one time I popped all my pain wrappers a ridge right first time I popped them I got eight nails out of ten eight I was like well [ __ ] man and then one died cuz I mean it was just it was one of them weird fee tones you know the first f1 something once in a while you get you get something incredibly stellar out of f1 your chances of getting something just ridiculously whole new great strain is really high but you also have that that chance that you're gonna get the really weird one you know the stunt did you know the mass always the same right it's got to equal out that's what the yin and yang is all about Santa and mrs. Mook he yeah he's uh why don't have any of his new stuff but I have his like his uh his ice applesauce and that last batch he ran but I told him to wait because I want I still haven't put his library together I got a whole library for him but I still gotta finish just putting it together I just finished harvesting all the seeds and sausage helped me get that done last week by prompting this [Music] I got more stuff coming off yeah I just thought yesterday I hit a hit my panty dropper with glass big blood that I've feminized pollen that I harvested this summer so I'm going to get a few beans from that and then I'm gonna feminized that clone you know what I mean great now I have oh my god I lost count last time at like 67 strain different strains and beans and I just popped should I pop another six this week I think all right you know scared Roby me too I want to make sure he'd get onto YouTube it's gonna be staggered of course because there's no way I'm gonna be able to flowering out 24 they're not gonna be it already at the same time the only getting on his grow off though email me or whatever you need to do you ain't got pay power whatever all right guys I am going to hit the head get me something to eat take a break and I'll be back at it later if I do something different if I harvest something else or if I do another step on this oh let me show you my last step okay once you start cooking this in this still up here right get it all cooked off and I still puts the alcohol in the is a clean jar when you open it up when this kicks off that the temperature I got it set at it'll be real liquidy normally you guys will keep running keep running it and then harvest it out of here but this thing's so big and it's hard to get up in the syringe when it's real thin it gets real stinky real easy so so what I do is I leave it the alcohol in it so it's easy to make handle and then I bring it to the oven I'll put it on bake 200 until it comes up to temp and then I cut the oven off and this is a D car process as well as the finishing process you see it bubbling right now that's alcohol coming out of it see how little is left and that was from a gallon of liquid this is why you don't see a lot of our sou needs a ton of product to make it to be able to harvest it in any kind of quantity but that's it guys I am Harley grower I'm a mission County misfit architected tank and a bearded bud brother and I'm out of here", "le8Pgcb0uaM": "Roja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel cannabis connoisseurs I hope you're all taken care yourselves and each other out there Sheeran and chemo back on the channel here got another product to review for you today we've got a 510 threaded vape cartridge from sundial cannabis called lemon riot we got 0.5 grams sativa hybrid coming in at 791 milligrams THC one point five milligrams CBDs are gonna be hitting about 79 80 percent THC on this less than a percent CBD it's a heavy hitting THC vape cartridge from sundial tried this strain before in flower sundial product the lemon riot really enjoyed it purchased it a few times it's got a great taste a nice citrusy lemon taste flavor in the bud really looking forward to see how that translates to the cartridge here for some beeping you know what without further ado let's get this package open it's a little bit of a unique package I haven't seen one like this before um yeah it's okay I will let you know it was packaged in November 16th 2019 and like I said it's a 0.5 grams let's without further ado let's get it okay I'm really excited to try this guy I just want to rip it open so um we're gonna go to a so on the top here it says twist in a line and push up so we twist what are we twisting here yeah sometimes these things are not too clear okay there you go so we want to looks like we're aligning here Oh push the top oh look at that it's kind of crazy little pop so push the top off you got your cartridge in there just like that kind of neat let's take it out of here if we can yeah it's a little foam thing in there it's kind of neat like a little push pop so still some wasteful packaging right you know Canadian legal cannabis wasteful packaging but go to I mean it's kind of a neat package and I do like that you kind of have somewhere that you can put this afterwards if you in between cartridges so that's kind of cool so let's put that cool package over here and let's see what we got all right so here's your standard 510 threaded VAP cartridge oil looks you know not bad pretty clear not too bad looking for oil I've seen worse doesn't look too murky kind of moving a little bit in there when I move it that's good it's kind of what you want to see in your oil I think so for my experience this is a nice color you got the sundial branding on the one side and the other side you got your THC warning sticker along the bottom here says lemon riot and yellow let's take the little mouthpiece condom off and yeah we've got our most about the charger on our battery let's take it off standard battery here for a 510 threaded cartridge let's screw it on and there you go so looks like ready to rock so without any further ado and let's jump right in I'm really excited to try this out oh yeah you got that citrusy lemon flavor kind of a earthy kind of taste to it as well I was expecting to be hit over the head with just lemon citrusy flavor there's a bit there but it's got a little bit more of a an earthy flavor to it you know kind of hummus almost like kind of piney in a way yeah you definitely definitely kind of get those hints those notes of lemon citrus on the inhale and on the exhale you get sort of a earthy piney taste now this is a really nice balanced flavor to this I really like it but it's surprising I thought it was gonna be a little bit more like BAM you know hit me with that citrus lemony flavor but it is there a little subtle but it is a good taste I like the exhale flavor is a little bit earthy kind of piney good sort of a class of cannabis flavor going on with this um it's been about what 40 seconds since I took a drag I almost feel like again a little bit of effects going on here this is my first hit of the day haven't had anything before this I like to come into these reviews kind of fresh so uh first impressions packaging is pretty nice design I don't know no I'm not gonna give it any awards on design there's kind of a lot going on here you got the white top the yellow bottom you got the branding there it's not going on it's alright but for taste so far really enjoying it lemon citrusy piney earthy on you so it's really nice great flavor so we're gonna get this marinating here we're gonna check it out gonna hate this up throughout the day put it through its paces okay so for the last couple days just exclusively they've been using the Sunday lemon riot vape here I've got to say I like this thing hits you hard it lasts for a while and it comes on pretty quick it's it's good B it's about eighty percent THC so you know it's gonna hit hard but it lasts for a while it's gonna last you about one or two hours on set right away what you're gonna get is a nice daytime sativa high you know cerebral head kind of focused energetic happy overall gets through your day really good babe I like it recommended value wise you know these things run about fifty bucks seems to be about standard for a 5-10 credit card trade you get about they say 0.5 grams in there which is standard for these unfortunately we'd like to see something your tanks come out and some cheaper prices but what can we do right we're gonna get there for what it is though you get a good value like I said I've been reefing on this thing for two days oh three to five five second drags every time and you know we still got quite a bit of oil in the tank as you can see it's gonna last you for a while we're gonna get you through value eyes give it a thumbs up effects wise two thumbs up you know even the packaging I know I like to rip on the Canadian legal weed packaging I like this packaging you know it's got that pop top push pop you got a little container that you can put it back in here you want to switch cartridges back and forth is it a little wasteful a little much yes but I do like it what can I say I like their packaging this one so value effect is good values good effect is good taste flavor yeah this where you might be a little disappointed you're expecting a real citrusy lemon hit you over the head with flavor you're not going to get it that's what I was expecting as well - what you get is you know a little bit of lemon citrusy on the inhale on the exhale more of an earthy piney kind of flavor and that's definitely the more dominant flavor that's a tasty hit in the mouth afterwards I don't not like it it's not bad it's just not what I was expecting at all when I got when I went and got something named lemon right because I have had the flower before does have a really strong citrusy lemony taste to it didn't really fully come through on here but I gotta say I'm not disappointed with the taste that's there so overall everybody I'm gonna say definitely recommend a limit right sundial 510 0.5 sativa cannabis faith cartridge here for you that's the end of my review thumbs up recommended let me know what you think as always leave me a comment read them all reply to them all like to hear what you say have you got any questions comments concerns I like to hear what you think about it did you like it you don't like it yeah leave a comment by all means

shirts CNC connoisseur shirts got a box of men and uh remember it's large but other than that it's free so uh on top of that see how Hempfest is coming up make sure you go check out em fast skip the lines by membership it's only like 60 bucks the VIP zone like a hundred bucks pick it up go smooth with everybody check me out I'll be there mate hatton captain look forward to seeing you there all right well that being said well we doubted there's a review for one of the producers processors mowers whatever in a Washington state this would be artisan cannabis they can be found at artisan cannabis calm with a Z AR TI z n CA n and a bis artisan cannabis now this is a some of their distillate that they have here and this is also some of the distillate in a vapor cartridges these are a new style of vapor cartridge I'm unfamiliar with but they say they're the [ __ ] we're gonna find out wouldn't open these things up and get some good strong [ __ ] pulls on them and see what they're like and I'll Rost into a big fat dava's blue dream just to get good and baked and uh first things first I'm just like the emails good to go I'm gonna set these aside and open this up to a big fat dab of it so with him fest coming up there's so much going on I got a few different things happen got some people sending me some things to do some tests out hopefully doing some videos on a couple products before him fest about dab it on the go some some dab pipes and things like that I was thinking about maybe an email electric email but portable email button I don't know if that's gonna happen or not but thinking about it we show you some of this that right there you can't really go wrong with that and I mean see how much of its in there and you see right do it there good stuff good stuff good stuff all right so this year they're calling this stuff eighty six point five two THC so that's uh that's pretty good I'm gonna do a bigger one something a bigger tool here cuz nice consistency to it you know it'll hold the glass still nice and gummy though mmm very nice alright well here we go so Marta's in blue dream Cheers probably headed that [ __ ] out I know not really necessary makes me look stupid as all [ __ ] it doesn't matter okay on these cartridges hmm now blue dream they call it Turkish still it doesn't really have a whole lot trip to it doesn't have a little uh flavor it's a nice bland across the board but not nothing really shiny it is just a good all-around product and it is only $20 a gram right now artisan turbed it's no $20 a gram can't really go wrong these though these are half 1/2 gram cartridges and I picked them up for me there are 14 dollars a piece fourteen dollars a piece now here we go the store tries to uh add in when these little sheets right here tells ya a couple tips on your vape cartridges don't storm where it's hell hot Oklahoma bad for your car the returns is outlined by Washington state law all that [ __ ] anyway so on the back here well got a camera let's just say what the [ __ ] we got going on [Music] this here is uh to maximize yours in Carter juices direction then attributes now it says that use it with a push button battery it will not operate with the automatic ones that require suction to operate now that being said we're gonna try it and we're gonna see this says is a other producer suspended brands that may be who takes their distillate and makes it into vape Carson fluid able to pass through this cartridge this particular cartridge is one unlike I've seen before it has all the basic standard parts I believe just a different different build they say wait 15 seconds and says the one and a half millimeter hole size works with a wide variety of oil viscosity now I do believe what they're referring to you can see it here and I'm also it to you again without fit little hole right here that hole right there of course Bonnie Lee right there on the Dutch bread which the back of this one was obvious am um one last yeah I say about the same but then when you start looking at him this Dutch berries running an eighty one five nine and this is orange cush is running 90169 so you look at 81 691 seven that's actually pretty substantial but other than that they both appear relatively comparable alright well there's a good close-up and I wasted some [ __ ] time a lot of people don't like my long videos but I don't care um now that I'm over here I realized I should have actually opened one up over there and that's what I'm going to do I'll just I came back over here to grab my batteries to make sure that um we could utilize them properly let's get her done again here's the Dutch barrier here's the orange push we'll be working with is a loud vape this is a one of the standard suction batteries that they were talking about drawn it bottom lights up pretty standard this however is different this is a push button much higher voltage kind of same basic thing just does quite a bit better that's a pretty good company I got this um for the interwebs there they're at a problem with it lasts lasts for days and days so without any further ado let's bust into this orange push first again at the stats 91.7 um art is in okay there we go there if you have the orders in printing do it on the glass just kind of trick first things first you pull off the bottom the guard to open up the threads and this I believe this is just a silicone that covers up the mouthpiece all right see there's a hole there and a hole there assuming that's for some airflow first things first let's screw on here just for shits and grins and I see if we get a puff of smoke doesn't even light up so that's cool no big deal there but just FYI if you are in the market and you do see an artisan it will not work with a standard suction draw battery let's try with this one it is a very nice looking fluid for sure nice looking cartridge feels good nice heavy feel solid soon as you're working let's do a draw on it here not bad devil a decent hit home that being said a lot of that is because this is a 10 second hole and a lot of the smaller battery systems or five seconds hmm orange cush tastes a lot like a lot of cartridges um one of my complaints about a lot of the cartridges these don't carry a lot of flavor the actually flavored ones they um they aren't they aren't so bad but it's all very technically a canned flavor in my opinion he's very fake and forced this actually on out for effect I'm sure it's pretty good I can actually feel it a little bit my head it's not bad the flavors subpar I probably give it maybe a 6 I bought it on sale the wife likes these we really dry them on walks this one gives a good strong hit so it definitely gets a high mark in that category but on flavor way down at the end there so uh yeah maybe six on this one out of ten normally don't mark things on a scale but [ __ ] I'm a little stoned and I got a couple different things to work with so [ __ ] it we're scaling it today we're scaling it today make sure you like and subscribe in the bottom of this if you're still watching I know it's a long video but and you guys have already subscribe thanks for giving me that thousand hope you appreciated that one gram dab alright let's see right here we've got an issue all right now see right here we got an issue kind of glad I did that on the old video tape there I've got my receipt here so let me show you the problem sure this you there it is Dutch berry running good open it up and you can already see I love you can see that paper or not for there's some goo right there on the back of this car did you see it right here alright now that should be like that at all I'm actually gonna call the store and see what they're gonna say about this and I'll talk to you a second all right how's everybody doing this is John again CNC connoisseurs and this is part 2 of the old artisan so I ran back down to the store with my receipt and I went to turn it in and I got a bunch of flack here's the deal even when this legal no one likes to take their drugs back doesn't matter so you guys saw what I saw I showed it on the camera I opened it in front of you from this sealed situation simmer open this one what I was told by the guy behind the counter was it looks like somebody had some on their finger when they were loading it into the box okay first off I'm not gonna get into it right now but there's no oil in the packaging room just so you know there's no oil in the packaging room they don't fill one of these up screw the lid on put it in the box and throw it in a bin but anyway doesn't matter apparently if it does leak it leaks from the bottom out the base where the heating element is or off the top well in a brand new cartridge and you'll notice there's no sticky [ __ ] on this one now brand new cartridge there's silicone seals on the bottom and on the top which actually doesn't [ __ ] are basing it off it's actually [ __ ] on there very [ __ ] well so the only place that can leak is where threads together and was leaking right there I believe remembers the stoner [ __ ] do I know so anyway I'll send a email to artisan and let them know it's trying no big deal I may not have been screwed together all the way hell there's a chance that it could have actually been some stickum on somebody's finger but that being said there's no real way to tell these [ __ ] apart let's like keep switching this purple lid back so I'm gonna put this purple lid on the orange I'm telling you that's like watch the video later in case I get stoned and forget but this is the Dutch berry pretty excited about this one I don't know if it has any terms to it but the Dutch spray flower from artisan was very good there there this lays isn't the best it's not too bad there pin they're not the best we'll try this one artisan that's Barry Cheers that's not quite as bad there you go so these here I gotta say are pretty much no real flavor this one here is actually a little harsh there were 17 bucks when I got him no I wasn't the receipt here 17 bucks they hit pretty hard going on a hike or something if you got a good battery there they're a decent option if you want a nice pleasant experience it's not exactly where I go neither one of these tasted very good artisan they're flour is phenomenal in my experience some of their wax concentrates we're not too bad this it's on a scale of one to ten I would say artisan distillates in general all right about a six which they're flowers an eight and a half plus some of it but that's long enough video for that remember if you do get a cartridge I'm in a legal state in Washington State specifically it states right on the receipt you have seven days to return the defective cartridge from the date of purchase you must have the original product package and sales receipt all of which I had still got flack hard flack shop there every day every day but what are you gonna do this is John from CNC connoisseurs you guys have a good one cards in cannabis Cheers", "U9DRhcov5Jg": "[Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps here and today we're going to be taking a look again at the americana or americana blackline og i think it's actually americana um yeah so here's what it comes in big tube aussie i like the tube i don't i kind of dislike boxes when it comes to cartridges because there's already a tube inside the box you know it kind of defeats the purpose of having a box in in my opinion you just decorate the tube like you know americana does there and the cool thing about that tube it's super thick uh let me show you guys again this is super thick like you could fit like maybe like four blunts in here a few joints depending on you know how big you make them like a backwood that's maybe one or two backwoods but yeah so here we got the cartridge americana blackline emoji like i said before and let's take a hit so all you guys out there please pack yourself a bowl a dab all that good stuff get your pen ready about to take a hit cheers it's a steam man i really really like the flavor profile of this um sorry my hair is a little messy because uh hectic day didn't really get to do much with it but yeah i'm really impressed so far is what i'll say about the americana brand in general like i said in a previous video with this i have had the pineapple express uh cartridge before and this is just my second cartridge from them but um it's honestly so good like i personally dislike distillates uh mainly for the taste and i just feel like live resin or cured resin cartridges give me like a fuller spectrum of a high especially that since a lot of them include cbd and things like that but this is probably the most solid distillate i've had in a long time and i have not tried any buddies distillates yet so um that's coming very soon so maybe my opinion on this might change but i've had a lot of distillates and this is definitely really really good like i'd say this is better than absolute extracts that's not a hot take i've had a lot of absolute extracts in the past in fact when i first started vaping uh or you know smoking uh 510 thread cartridges and things like that i started off with absolute extracts as the first brand that was two three years ago and i stopped using cartridges mainly because i was just blowing through them too fast but you know fast forward to now things are a lot different for me but i still have the same kind of taste and preferences you know and this definitely hits the nail on the head it's got a really good flavor let's take another hit and talk a little bit more about the flavor i know some of you guys may have watched the other video so you already know kind of what this tastes like but we'll take another one and let you guys know how it tastes for those who don't so cheers so the first thing you get this is a very very nice sweetness to it so at first i thought it was a sweet aftertones it's also sweet in the after tons but it's very sweet throughout very very like a not too sweet very flat kind of sweet and there's a little citrusiness to it and i'm pretty sure that's the lime part of the name but yeah there's a tiny tiny bit of citrusiness i'm not sure if it's like an orangey citrus or a lemony citrus which is more of the sour kind of thing i do get tiny bits of tang here in the back of a back of my tongue which is really nice you know kind of reminiscent of a lime but yeah honestly for 40 bucks a gram i don't think you can go wrong with this and um i think i want to start a new series on just bargain cartridges you know there's a new brand out there that everyone is talking about and i've tried before too i just didn't do a video on it it's called surplus and they do really great gram cartridges for about 30 to 35 so maybe that'll be coming next after i go through the next purchase and all that good stuff but yeah i'll take one final hit for the road for you guys but i'm i'm really digging this one you know that uh i don't know if i can give it any formal ratings or reviews at the very moment i think i'd like to you know put this up against something you know in a cart comparison before i give it any good things but for as the you know the most i'll say about it is this is definitely a buy yeah cheers everybody oh another good thing i'll say these are really smooth i know i just coughed a bunch but for a distillate they're really smooth like i think that like the flavor of this is very comparable to this dizzy pods the cannabis derived terpenes dizzy pots yeah this is how flavorful these get so yeah i highly recommend you guys give this brand a try p2 out peace", "yrn54Bbg1Lg": "today we're smoking lemon train wreck from full spec full spec is a cannabis company out of washington state this is their live resin cartridge lemon train rack is a cross of golden lemons and train wreck it's an indica dominant hybrid one of my favorite things about the packaging was that it provided that necessary information it told me the cross told me whether there's indica sativa or hybrid of the two which is great things for a cannabis consumer regardless of your experience to have on the packaging it keeps me from having to look that information up and figuring out what's in it it tells me sort of an idea on what i can expect maybe not the entirety of the high but it gives me a baseline to go off of their live resin cartridges taste really good when i exhale this it tastes just like a bunch of lemons i really enjoy that flavor and that's not something that you get from like an indica hybrid typically like the lemons lean more towards the sativa but in this case i think the flavor combination is excellent one of the things i like about the cartridges i'm gonna take it out of my pen here is the tips i don't know these tips are way more comfortable to hit than like the flat ones so like this one you can see a difference in like the size of the mouthpiece these i don't feel like get as clogged as the other style um the other style i tend to have end up clogged in my pocket a lot i'm smoking this out of my vessel battery vessel makes really good high quality batteries for your c-cell cartridges this one is more like a tube like the normal c cell and then they have a palm one that fits in your hand as well the effects of this were really good i smoked it like during a corn maze that i just did following directions got kind of complicated after a while but we were able to get out thanks to some great navigation um the flavor's excellent that super lemon flavor is really good full spec uses single source cannabis so they source their cannabis from themselves um they can have control of the entire process so they know exactly when when that cannabis from the time that it was a seedling to the time that they like freeze it and package it to turn it into live res so they control the whole process and i really like it when companies have the entire process under one roof so that they are allowed to have more control over what goes into their products anyways be sure to check out vessel the batteries be sure to check out

content", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them

the state of Florida and this video is to show you a an easy way to save some money by reclaiming all the stuff that's left and your distillate cart store you're just a little arranges your carts basically any container that has to concentrate in it you can do this with it and reclaim some of that THC as you can see what I got here it's a doesn't smell great you know it's been degraded at this point I mean if you look at this jar this is over probably six months or something that's a lot of sizes and carts in there as you know these parts when they get to the end of their life you know the oil doesn't do so well in them they start browning the oil so you know this isn't gonna be the tur piaced it's not going to be the tastiest but it's very effective and one thing about this stuff that I found is it leans towards the sedative side probably because a lot of the THC or at least some of it I don't know exactly how much but has converted into CBN which is a sleepy cannabinoid so but it's very effective and it's pretty strong so I'm just gonna show you how to do it you collect all of your old syringes carts well first let me go over what you're gonna need you're gonna need a jar you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol you can use 90 percent or 70 percent if you have to if I wouldn't because it's a pain in the butt evaporating 99% alcohol is so easy you could just leave it on the counter for a day and it will evaporate you probably do need to run a fan over afterwards to maybe a little heat to get every bit of it out but you could just leave it for another day and it probably get most of it all now you stir it up a few times a day excuse me so you also need a funnel you'll need some coffee filters just regular standard sized coffee filters and I'll show you how to cut them now you need one of these it will find screen sieve or something like that parchment paper put your collected reclaim on scissors I think I said panel so evaporation dish if you want the silicone go for a silicone dish because this is a little annoying but you know these mats have their place you'll need some tinfoil I'll show you what that for a little bit I think that's I think I got everything obviously something to put your dad's in alright calling them dabs but really I should say reclaim is what it is so first step put all of your used syringes and carts into a jar and you know I like to use a jar that's as close to the volume of what you're reclaiming as possible so this in this case a big old ball jar or cur mason jar anyway so you fill this up all the way to the brim with alcohol leave it like this for a day or so and you just want to come to it several times a day like a lot of these syringes and carts where the old stuff has built up it's dark brown and that's because all the terpenes and stuff are oxidizing in there and that I find that it turns into kind of a varnish almost it's still got a lot of active ingredient in it but it's a it's a much stickier tougher not sticky but more of a hard varnishing type surface and you know substance and it's harder it doesn't dissolve as well in alcohol so what you need to do is give the alcohol time to work on it this isn't something like a bud where you just put it in there there's stuff in there that's been treated by heat and that makes it harder to dissolve so this will take at least a day probably now I haven't tried this but I bet what you could do is put this in a hot water bath and then it might speed that process up to like you know a few hours a couple hours or just so after the day is done and you've got and you're looking and you can't see buildup in there you don't see like a bunch of spark stuff stuck in the corners of those things hooray so you take this well actually first we need to get your filter you see how I've cut this down you want to cut it down because this is going to absorb a lot more of your active than this so the way you do that is you can fold it in half and you just keep folding in half so you get into this cone shape right here alright now take your screen put it in the middle of it this is so you don't make your thing too small and you want to cut it you just put it right in there a little like this the tip of it and then you cut it right on this rim right here just a little bit there you go that's not hanging everywhere that's basically all you need you just want it to sit down in there if it's hanging out of the top too much then it'll have a tendency to try to get out of here yeah it doesn't like being shoved in this thing now you take your excuse me you take your evaporation dish now if you're not using a silicon dish and I think even if you are what you're probably gonna want to do is you see this right here and I've used several different this is just the latest thing I've used but they always have the problem of this thing can just slide right off now there's a couple ways you can deal with this put it in like an Allen or something this is a better way to deal with this just taking a little strainer and just wrap some foil around it and use that as a spacer that will keep your basket right there all righty now take the jar and just pour the liquid in here it can be helpful to use this this won't let this funnel will not let any of this stuff through obviously so you can just work straight into the phone and not worry so much about just pouring out the sides you don't want your gonna have like sediment and stuff from that that you don't want to vape you don't want it to be in your final product that's what we're using this screener so this is a good way to just see what as much bad in there as you want it's not going through only the liquid alcohol is coming through all right so once you poured all of the brown liquid golden brown I guess out of here through this you're gonna have just a pan of alcohol solution in here with a bunch of THC at this point there are a few ways you can deal with it you could put this in a hot water bath and just get a bigger pan basically it has a lot of water volume whenever you do a hot water bath you want to make sure that you know the amount of hot water you're using is is is enough to kind of overwhelm it's to the the other substance that you're trying to evaporate you know with heat that heat energy is gonna is what is making it evaporate so you you need a plentiful supply of the hot water and you just let that stay in there for a couple hours um it would probably take longer than that without a fan so you had a fan it might get it done with that timeframe but if it takes too long you need to start changing out hot water out periodically until it's all evaporated so that's how you do it and here's what I got what's my result after I scraped it up I should've gotten a fool here a little bit it'll work let's see if this is focusing very well and so this is the result it's I would guess about 2 grams of this stuff maybe more and um so what I kind of started to say earlier is that the consistency is different depending on how what kind of stuff you're using and how far you take it and see look you can butter this stuff up pretty well or not butter own or they call it taffy maybe I like taffy I'm not sure if you can get this to pull and snap without a whole bunch more heat treatment you know likes more heat and air running over it look at that how pretty this is so it was dark you know lightens up really well this definitely it doesn't have a great I need to say yeah it doesn't have a great smell it kind of almost doesn't smell very much at all and this is just mostly distillate almost all distillate so that explains why you know this isn't why this is not reclaimed from add a break or anything like that this is purely the leftover stuff and cartridges and just lit syringes so alright that's about all you need to know and this will get you plenty high I'm probably gonna use most of this in edibles edibles aren't my aren't the most effective thing for me but they are good for sleeping nighttime pain relief that kind of stuff but this would definitely make some potent edibles and you don't really need all the weed flavor when you're cooking you know that's sometimes the weed flavor is it doesn't really complement what you're cooking with so this could be really good in that respect it just seems pretty neutral and definitely get you medicated very well medicated all right well thanks for watching and check out I've got some true leaf lemon OG came in 29.3% oh man you've got a scene you open one of those things up delicious it's one of my favorite strange lately out of tree leaves alright thanks for watching", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you

next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "oUJA-NTsyJ8": "[Music] every one today we're gonna be going over three ways to salvage your oil cartridges from empty or broken cartridges so whether you drop your bait pin break the cartridge glass in the process or your oil cartridges almost empty you just want to get those small remnants just below the airflow hole or maybe a cartridge is faulty and it just hasn't worked from the start here's a few quick reasons why you shouldn't throw away your cartridges just yet so the easiest way to get the most oil out of your cartridge is with a syringe but let's say we don't have one so we're gonna resort to some more primitive methods but first you're gonna need a few things plastic bowl ziplock bag a microwave and a sheet of foil you can also use a zig zag paper rolls if you don't have any foil if you want to transfer oils from one cartridge to another then you're gonna need a new empty cartridge too if your cartridge glass is shattered into pieces you run the risk of transferring oils with small shards in them and I don't recommend that but if it's just cracked and it's leaky then it shouldn't work all the same just be gentle with it but first put the oil cartridge that you want to transfer oil from into a ziploc bag and zip it up and set it aside for right now second is to get your plastic bowl and fill it with water then take it and put into the microwave for about two to three minutes or until you see it's steamy third step is to take the bowl out for the microwave and place the bag with the cartridge inside of it again make sure that's airtight so no water gets in and just pop it in there for about 2 minutes place the sheet of foil down on a flat clean surface this will act as your work station to catch any oils and then take the mouthpiece off of the cartridge and make sure that the heating post is exposed after about two minutes of the cartridge being inside the water bowl take it out remove the mouthpiece usually use a napkin or towel because it's gonna be hot and once the mouthpiece is off flip it upside down directly mirroring of the cartridge below and just set it right on top and I promise you that the balancing act is a lot more easier than it looks make sure not to get any oils down the heating post because that's where the airflow comes from heat makes oil less viscous and allows it to run so the oil should just slide right into the cartridge if you don't want to transfer your oils to another cartridge you can just put them directly on a cake batter or cookie dough you can also place the cartridge upside down on the foil to let it catch the oils and use it for later sort of the refrigerator use it for dabbing or use a dab tool to peel it off and put on your dry herbs once your oils are transferred to the new cartridge place the mouthpiece back on and you're ready to date so

"[Music] filling and capping correctly will preserve integrity speed and cleanliness are the key for an efficient assembly if you missed our mixing instructional please follow the link to the video once your mixture is warmed and ready you will have to fill in cap quickly so it's important to be thoroughly frapped some items to keep on hand are scales pipettes syringes heat guns wipes or paper towels 90 proof denatured alcohol gloves masks silicon spatulas metal stirrers and hats or beard Nets there are a couple of methods to fill namely hand syringes and filling machines while using syringes by hand offers the most control filling machines avoid fatigue and shoots consistent accurate amounts there are several brands including cool jars and Thomas Duke today we will fill with the cool jars a 10 filling machine for more information please watch our product spotlight video the a 10 filler has a digital control panel and thermometer first preheat the unit adjust the heat depending on your ratios the more viscous the higher the temp stay within a conservative range of 100 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit fill the heated receptacle with your mixture adjust the piston length for the cart size you are filling perform a couple of initial fills to make sure there are no air bubbles still trapped in the piston if there is you will hear a sharp fizzing make sure to leave some space from the bottom of the cart when you press the pedal to avoid spillage take care to not overfill try to finish the entire run to avoid reheating your mixture when switching flavors purge and clean thoroughly time is crucial when it comes to capping after you fill filling while hot will prevent large air bubbles also make sure the rubber gaskets are intact this prevents spillage during capping see cells feature press caps using a press we press the cap evenly account for a few defects once capped they cannot be taken apart and uneven caffeine should not pass quality control LC and his features screw on caps if you make a mistake you can always correct it place the cap on lightly and screw on either by hand or with a customized drill polish to wipe away any sticky residue and then on to packaging it's important to remember not all carts are created equal some have wicks that soak up solution so you may need to finish off with a hand syringe some carts will need to be inverted after capping storing your finished product will take some care don't leave it out in direct sunlight or it may burn and change color do not refrigerate try to store in dry room temp areas

"so after reading a few comments I decided that I wanted to make this video answering some of the questions you have on various things like is care T and muha med cards real and just a few various questions to help you understand vaping a little bit better and I thought why not make a part 2 of a video I did almost a year ago about how to get the most out of your oil cartridges this is gonna be a two part video so make sure you stay to the end so that you don't miss anything [Music] storage definitely plays a role into your oil cartridges we went over this in the last video but traveling at a higher altitude will affect your vape pen this is due to the change in air pressure the increased air pressure forces air into the device which can inhibit performance and cause leaking higher quality tanks are better equipped to withstand altitude changes if you plan to go to a higher altitude location purchase one that can handle these conditions or keep the rubber caps that come with the cartridges so I get asked a lot what is the best voltage for oil cartridges and I always say new vapors start low and experience vapors already no but if you are ready to move up to the next step three point two or three point five always works for me it gives me a big inhale but I can still taste the flavor of the terpenes but everyone has their own preferences but just remember that continuing to vape at max voltage for too long will burn out the card from sooner too much power could burn out the coil resulting in a burnt product with an unpleasant taste but what about the myth of leaving it standing upright leaving it standing upright is a good rule of thumb to have so that when you're ready to vape the oil is sitting down at the bottom by the airflow holes oil stick and can take some time to reach the bottom if you leave it lying on its side but it's not something crucial if stored in the right conditions you shouldn't get any leaks so what happens if you see your oil change color down by the airflow holes this is just your oil changing its structure due to the introduction of air and usually sunlight air and sunlight can change the color of your oil darker over time this is okay your oil is still safe to vape darker oil just means that the vapor was probably left exposed to sunlight and has darkened the oil through oxidization how do I make my oil last longer well that's up to the consumption of the user but getting the most out of each draw can help you from taking rip after rip absorption does not happen well if you let the vapors sit in your mouth inhale it down into your lungs inhale it deep and hold it there so that your lungs can fully absorb the vapor be aware of the voltage your vaping at also high as high and low as low as long as your vape isn't leaking or firing off in your pocket you should be able to recognize how long the point-five part will usually last you there's no blanket answer here everyone beeps differently do you leave the cartridge attached to the battery or remove it after every use I assume you're asking this because you don't want oil the link into your battery you shouldn't experience leaking if you keep your card can stored under 70 degrees Fahrenheit but after the seven days the structure of the oil will change and you might experience in very small amounts of leakage depending on where you store it so if you're still using the same car after a week then yes I would say cap it and store it in some place cool outside of the battery how long do you leave it in the fridge for oil cards don't really have an expiration date storing it in the fridge is just a way to keep your cards cool and away from sunlight you can keep it there for a while but you also don't want accumulation of moisture that's why I don't recommend the freezer either I've never kept mine in little fridge for more than about a week so but if anybody has kept it in there for longer please leave a comment down below and let me know what your experience is can you review hollow tip cards no because they're unregulated is KRT vapes a real brand umm they are real but there are also unwritten to my understanding I recently messaged them on IG and I'm waiting for a response I also heard that the blacklist hosted their testing results for clarity and past but you already know how I feel about our detest our glow carts real they are unregulated muh meds they also are unregulated so sorry about that guys I know you're hoping for the best there is a fake brands to avoid lists that I follow they try to update as much as possible but there's just a lot of brands and it's hard to keep up but this is the list that I use it really helps me out I'll put a link down below it has hundreds of brands on there so check it out share it get friends knowledge and finally is it possible to burn out or overcharge my battery yes absolutely when I work for a cellphone company we were trained in battery awareness so cell phones laptops camera batteries and bait batteries all need to expel energy it's a good idea to let your batteries die sometimes before charge me especially when it's the first time you get it not letting your battery die or using it before it's finished charging are ways for the battery to keep dead energy and the battery will expand and bubble up and never allow you to reach 100% again so that'll do it for this video guys we hope it was helpful let us know if you have any other questions down in the comments below like share subscribe this video and as always stay safe do your research and never vape underage peace", "3UWOCjjlWYk": "[Music] what's up y'all p2 peeps and today we're going to be looking at another delta 8 thc cartridge today it's going to be from rogue river labs instead though this is the super sour diesel delta 8 thc car this is just the packaging just to show you guys and here is the cart itself um just you know you guys get that color on there so yeah um real quick before i take it uh this is of course a different brand and um from this brand you can give two options of cartridges cards with bdt and cards with cdt so that being said let's go ahead and

day week whatever it is when you're watching this and uh yeah thank you for joining me [Music] so right off the bat very very flowery taste and that is mostly because of the bdds in there so here bdt stands for botanical derived terpenes meaning the terpenes are coming from flowers so of course it's going to have a little bit more of a flowery taste there um comparatively to a cdt you know cannabis derived terpenes but it still has good flavor um and well good effect you know like i said before and so my other delta hc videos i feel like this kind of hits me a little bit faster excuse me than regular thc it's a very kind of heavy like back in the head type type of feel at first it kind of just like it just kind of feels like it's pulling you back a little bit um and yeah i mean very relaxing effects not only for a lot of delta thc products and uh you know all that stuff so real quick question guys have you tried any delta 8 thc and if you have please let me know down below in the comments and while you're at it don't forget to like comment and leave another comment and subscribe if you're enjoying the video so far so yeah those are the notes we're getting with flavors here it's just kind of flowery you know i'm not getting um too many differences there you know there's a slight tang and souriness there um but not too much as we're getting a lot of that the flowery tones so let me go ahead and take another hit here and then talk a little bit more about how i'm feeling about this one cheers everybody [Music] okay before i talk about this a little bit more i do want to take the time to correct myself in my last video i said that this was legal in all 50 states it is not i will be putting a list of all the states that delta a thc is legal in uh down below in the description so you know you guys don't get it twisted i mean i have it in the other uh video as well but you know i just felt like i should at least address my mistakes i mean i always do anyway whenever someone corrects me but um you know i just feel like it's a little bit better to address that as well in the video so very sorry to those who might have been slightly misinformed i mean probably not a big number of you guys no one really watches these videos but but you know yeah so after that last hit i'm feeling pretty [ __ ] lit i know guys i feel like the more i hit delta hthc the more obviously you know you get tolerance you get a little used to it but the more i i just kind of learned to enjoy it more um i mean that's not to say i never enjoyed my first hit or nothing like that but yeah you know every delta a thc product i give you don't try out i'm more excited to get another one and give it a go give it a try all that stuff so for rogue or river labs i'm looking to try a cannabis derived terpene cart very soon so um for me this is the super sour diesel pretty good stuff i don't know personally whether uh i can discern between a sativa delta eight thc high and uh an indica one so hopefully you know i go grab an indica one as you know the cannabis derived terpene cart so that should be it for this video i do want to thank you guys for watching and tuning in

we have yeah out there in the universe there are different things yes out there on the universe atom so since the head of a major cannabis lab founder of a major cannabis brand I got the deets so so full spec is basically true - true - flower form so you know they maintain the the cannabinoid profile that exists on the flower terpene profile and they essentially just concentrate it so we do that with cryogenic ethanol here so we make a cryogenic ethanol concentrate then we reintroduce the same terpene profile extracted the supercritical co2 to the oil so the the profile of the terpenes and the cannabinoids is almost exactly what you would see on the flower just concentrated now most distillate based concentrates are more you know you would consider it to be more of like a THC isolate products so we try to concentrate really only the THC delta-9 profile and then a lot of groups will just put that in a cartridge by itself but a lot of groups like us reintroduce the supercritical co2 extract it's her teens - the distillate product then that goes into a vaporizer cartridge or syringe so you can't really call that a full-spectrum product because it's not really reminiscent of the you know the profile as it exists on the flower it smells more strange specific but distillate based right streamers is a dream specific full-spectrum exactly so that's the big difference there you get that Megan", "vfbEQNSMFXo": "[Music] so these forms of extraction kind of started like beautiful accidents like a lot of things in this industry being the first processors in the state of organ we dealt with a lot of new products and consistencies that have come about along the way liquid live resin is essentially our iteration of oil that can go into a cartridge we just take fresh frozen cannabis flower extract that here it get it clean and then fill cartridges with it so people are learning about distillate and about fake terpenes are liquid live resin is literally just libraries and it append there's no cutting agents there's it's not like a formulation it's not like I'm a chef and they're adding a bunch of stuff to a pot mixing it together and then putting it in a pen it's literally just live resin in a liquid form so that it can run through a cartridge from there we have innovated ways to then include liquid cured resin and those two products have a serious stronghold now with the demand for quality on the organ market so the difference between liquid cured and liquid live resin is the beginning product that we put inside so liquid cured resin is a cured either trim or node that would normally be made into a shatter and then the liquid live resin is fresh frozen that the cannabis companies will cut down fresh freeze it as quick as possible which gives you the highest terpene rich cannabis that you can have so that's just a differences the starting material as far as effects they aren't drastically different unless you're really looking for that 5% 10% more terpene variation which is liquid live rest when you pull this vape in out of your pocket and you have a drill on it you're gonna have that fresh plant experience just like you're at a farm

different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few

there it's got some nice clear oil in there and a nice view for you guys the uh this string type is a hybrid my opinion is a 50 50. i definitely get some nice euphoric effects as well as it definitely settles down into the mellow indica don't knock me out make me want to sleep or anything but i definitely mellow out it's not a sativa by any means particular lineage on this strain is a triple cross between three different strains chem sister sour dub and chocolate diesel all three of those strains cross to make gd4 original glue out of those three i honestly i'd like to try chocolate diesel by itself i'm not too big on uh the effects from the sour diesel strains i do like the gassy taste from it but i don't like the sativa but chocolate diesel that sounds [ __ ] nice go ahead and get another rip in here guys and then i will continue on about the strength hope you got your blunts your bones your joints bait pens whatever you do to get feeling nice and right get nice and medicate with me cheers everyone ghost got away with me but it was still a fat road make sure you stay hydrated guys when you're smoking especially when you're smoking even when you're not cheers i don't know why like carts these little vape pens over in cartridges always dry out my mouth always give me cotton mouth no matter which pic no matter what strain it is particular thc in this batch is 394.9 milligrams that comes out 78.9 percent thc 1.8 percent cbd leafly says it helps patients with stress pain and depression i agree with the the pain part definitely helped has been helping my stomach pain and nausea throughout the week i recommend this to people that like uh hybrid strains as well as need a nice daytime strain help with nausea and that kind of stuff it's a little bit of appetite stimulating you may get a little bit of munchies from it it's not a you know not very intense but i do get a little hungry when i consume this cannabis this particular strain had me feeling euphoric clear-headed um it made me want to enjoy music but then it soon made me uh mellow out didn't want to you know sleep or anything like that but i definitely just wanted to chill listen to some music and kick back that kind of thing so that's why i think it's a 50 50 hybrid in my opinion you know it's a hybrid obviously because i got that yellow [ __ ] from true leaf truly it's a hybrid it's yellow bud structure on this strain is both said to be and in my experience has been um light green with yellow pistols and hairs very um you know chunky resin covered uh very sticky buds so uh yeah you're really glue that's why gg4 that's why i got that name the glue part because it's very sticky the smell and taste on this particular strain is sweet earthy and very chemy we're going to take another rip here guys and i'll let you know what i think about that taste cheers like i said very s there's a nice sweetness to it i get the cartridge out of me nice but i got a little bit of chemical in there as well i definitely think that's coming from the chem sister as well as possibly from that uh chocolate diesel maybe i don't know a little bit of chemical there from the diesel and uh my experience every time i've had the flour it's always had a like a burnt chemical taste to it almost like a burnt tires but rubber you know how that smells that's what it tastes in my opinion so uh maybe that's how true leave is trying to uh you know represent it here in the distillate i don't know it almost tastes like chlorine like i like pool water you know when you were a little kid drinking pool or you know swallowing a little bit of pool water as a kid but not a bad way or anything nothing that would put me off just it's got that chemical taste to it it's definitely like a cam dog or a uh i don't know what else i don't know it's got like a like i said a sweet sour chemical taste to it i would definitely agree with that looking at the back here august 29th so this is about a month old every month yeah august 29th yeah about a month a month and a half here my math correct overall i definitely uh i'm enjoying this strain as well as the battery i know i've been talking a lot of [ __ ] about this battery been hyping it up from over truly for 10 bucks cannot beat it and anywhere else besides the dispenser you're not getting a battery like this for 10 bucks i guarantee that so if you have a chance to get over there truly definitely recommend picking these up like i said ten dollars you get uh two of the little metal adapter things and a little charger cable but it's just a

organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful

fifth to five 2020 so yeah I mean guys like I'm hoping this is going to be a fresh card she seems super excited about it and on top of it I don't even know what this is but like there's something right here take this off there's something right here that like gives like I guess like information but to find out pull it out I mean like rip it I guess you're supposed to yeah you're supposed to okay yeah you're supposed to take it off because it opened up just like this criminal warning storage information manufacture information see if the information note that is it kind of ripped off so I can't read that substance abuse warning and adverse event reporting adverse event potential product facts warnings keep that product away from probably children oh okay so it's basically the normal the normal their normal safety warnings and stuff I guess that's pretty cool how they do that I know you guys like it right back on there you know I so it says up here depressed or something flat right insert a flat object and push to open example a key or a pin or better yet I had a [ __ ] dab soul alright of course there's a sticker down here so you're gonna crack that sumbitch yeah that sumbitch open I'm super sorry about this man let's go already I like it I like to I like the packaging I like the hardware I mean not really hard let me look at this thing here SEC I like yeah I like this packaging ok even has a soft [ __ ] on the back here just out on the back no banging around not much uh not much head space here at all ladies and gentlemen and that's pretty good this is a fifty dollar cartridge of course it says C sell on it alright it looks like the normal the normal kind of I know if I have one just laying around I normally do anyway it looks like the normal sea so cartridges yeah I don't have one just laying around here I wish I did but I don't but yes it looks like the normal sea so Clark just not much headspace to charge up time here we go oh I bet that headspace here like I said not much headspace yet oh all right let's see here with this flavor it tastes like it says supposed to be what citrusy peppery mmm definitely peppery got a little thing on my tone there alright this guy had hook this [ __ ] thing up to the battery full spectrum spectrum our full spectrum full-spectrum let's see Jerry's hmm man I think what that's one thing I will say about the distillates that I do kind of miss the taste of the distillates because this was Joe I got some tasty as cartridges like I mean from from fruity to like cake to like straight-up tur P to straight-up cushy to skunky like it's crazy like I could take a cart there's a pink lemonade and make it taste like pink lemonade it's amazing now this one here is kind of earthy definitely a definitely peppery earthy I'm Dino the pool you know what Connor it kind of reminds me of like ups of a light MK ULTRA kind of flavor which was really really good yeah yeah like like it m'kay what's your kind of this what is reminding me I like my own notebook my wife got it for me it's I keep my little do my homework on the on the you know on the medicine I get but this is actually not not too too bad so just just say this the taste is is good I like to taste the price for $50 for a distillate a full spectrum I mean I don't really know the difference between full spectrum I guess I shouldn't looked thankful spectrum just means like one plant like nothing ounces on there but it's nice that they did it if they didn't have any literate live courts are carts I would I would definitely buy another one of these the 1937 [ __ ] full spectrum cars I mean this isn't bad or I would go with like the what is it there's another one out there that's so-called full spectrum I think it's I think it might be MPX or curio or some [ __ ] like that that has them like this but this taste I really can't get over to taste this taste is pretty amazing you bit what and I have it on the low the lowest setting on my battery tip - I don't never turn it up high I'm not trying to burn no oil in it but I'm definitely filling it definitely found it I haven't smoked in a few hours I wanted to wait to see how good this was and to be honest with you for a full spectrum distillate cart I got a nice little buzz going on and it's not like a little buzz either it's a nice I got a nice little buzz going on ahead buzz I got a nice little sweat going on almost like a dabs but I'd say mmm I don't feel like energized but I don't feel couch locked so that's that that's dead hybrid right there you know yeah man this is this is good for fourth distillate not bad not bad at all mmm if you're not let me tell you those guys if you're not a heavy dabber desolates will work for you all day every day right but like if you dab a heavy then you want to go with the liquid live resin karts that's just the way to go if you're if you're a heavy diver but if not if you're just a fire smoker bring

"akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "I4p7pJbjQtg": "what's up YouTube back again with another bid for you guys check it out some brand new something don't you and honestly ain't never done this before just kind of bear win all right bang first things first you know how about start the video from here and that's cherry this is a Cecil Jupiter enclosed which means not refillable but it's a sea cell a Jupiter's with C cell technology cartridge that's not refillable cartridge in get look at third I'll write something for you guys distillates syringes we're going to talk about distilling the prefilled syringes today check it out BAM you can always pause that's the bringing all your legal stuff batch numbers product numbers and of course all your warning labels that's just what it caming also another thing another thing is I broke it they come used it with something like this but if you seem kinda actually got broke know know if you can see that really well I'll flip that came but yeah there it is she broke off there cuz usually they got something like this and be able to on to the tip of it and you know I am cool should be broken there's kind of an example there's the thing which they using or a bit like that there's something to that effect and then they got that on the tip but I broke it so screaming trickier less them folks that's why I against got that that's why she's got that stupid stupid like Bowl thing around that and I've always hated that thing but that's what they do right there's they put this like I don't know if you can see it too well but it's that bowl thing like that inner Bowl thing they put that on there freakin lock into place and then just got a little spring in there - well thanks dumb cam that kind of locks it and it's real tricky to open and stuff when it's actually locked right which makes it child truth which is the hall but anyways it broke off don't matter just gonna make a little more difficult so anyways yeah back to funky I just wanted to show that I wanted everybody to kind of know first of all that I've never actually been sued the cart before I've never actually felt it with distillate or the more I've never really furthermore mean I've never really even like refilled any cartridge or even had distillery before it's the first time ever and honestly I'm diggin it man I so I wanted to try it so read a lot of reviews on it I think you're gonna bait this is the best way looking at about 40 bucks for a gram of distill II mean you know the pre feels more pay pay the same amount for about a half a grand prix food today we're gonna be filling in amigos liberty which is a new generation cartridge she's got a little picture on it if you can see that there - well I don't picture on the front of it dang it yeah it's got like a little picture on the front here so and also something totally new about this new generation cartridge I wanted to show you and sherry draw I haven't seen you yet first of all it's built like this and this coral stem is actually attached to the mouthpiece which is a little different for kind of needs to bold is hollow to feel awesome amazing I actually mixed where it's pretty cool to fuel pretty cool to fuel since I lost the tip but also comes off there too honestly you could refill it either way I guess probably gonna refill that away and flip it I don't know I'm gonna be doing alright and give me I think this is an amigo Liberty and this is what I wanted to show you guys I'm gonna fix the lighting in your little bit I'm going to show you this picture of it the picture on it also it's got a marking on it like a line I'm not sure what that is it could be a point eight cartridge and that kind of tells you for the we're you know over eight it over a half a gram is anything feel it upside down anything that line is probably at the point eight probably pulling a car probably posted you got it up but uh it's got this beam for airflow that you can actually adjust you see now let me know if you've tried the Liberty I just got it the other day let me screw Dean so I can actually do the thing check that out man one two or all three girls or just fully shut she not everybody it's just too awesome man I'm gonna close it check that out 1 V 2 V 3 V or fully enclosed see that breathing on it I've never seen with a breather on it and I've been meaning to see me see somebody actually do that with that I'm a built-in down here it's got an adjustable breather built in the top and also I might put what's over and left inside when I crush Urquhart I'm seeing mess with them I of course got him about a full cream and half cream minced in previous video showed in previous videos I don't really like the eye crusher Kirk because there's no resistance whatsoever like you just liked blending in oxygen and uh I really like it cuz I just liked breathing in oxygen a lot of people like that drawback I hold back but I really don't only down all to it it does have like a split back sometimes draw too fast and look it means that at the very bottom every time you know and get that out because you have other rules but there is oil all around it nice because there's no there's not a lot of separation at all completely lies in that very bottom piece so that's saying I guess we're going to go ahead this one will be trickier because this part does not remove on I crush your technology card in the card so it's gonna trick me yeah I don't know we'll give it a shot I'll see the packages it's gonna be a longer video than usual I'm really stoned you know I'm going to continue and I want to know all the details no too much all right me this game let's read through this thing like I said first time I ever done this me you how I'm gonna do this here right job I'm back I just wait for a minute and stuff up good news about that is I didn't find out a few things we're gonna looking peep out here I looked up I gotta feel this thing first of all and I'm gonna figured out what that line was at the bottom that's actually where I need to fill it to that's actually where I need to fill it to I don't know if you can see that line name there's a black line all the way across him yeah all right it's because I should I'll give you anything right now I'm sorry I'm we think the only thing I got today yeah we'll make a hole in the video on the other stuff though just because you feel it like that and fill it to that in line when this thing goes back in there it actually goes up you know I'm saying get the scenario so here goes we don't feel this big car now let's get my gosh it's so pretty just falling you guys can see it out there it's so pretty just falling I hope I hope you can I think he can see that gets us oh that's so lovely it's about half of it so it should be there and I know a lot of people got a lot of scenarios about this problem right here when it comes to refilling the Chargers like deciding I've done informed but I you know me I get schooled on everything fried to post this is the number one thing I found useful buy medicine and rent by looking it up looking into me and messing around the old cart because I've got me and step on the sides and as far as stuff that's sticking out ain't down there yet while I'm trying to refill this regular flame and some heat spill it fall over talent see that Bell every Tom [ __ ] fall should go down slowly now that's what I do to get to go down I'm right now I'm gonna see kind of how much that got us there it should be somewhere close we're gonna let it go down a minute and come back actually finish the video hold up right shot we've got it I need up at him to add a little bit more a couple more drops you see there but it worked out shown and I wanted to show you I actually worked out almost right on it's still going down a little bit but yeah there's the line you really can't you see that line now that it's to it but there is a line see that line there it is it has to be to that line being when you put your steam like I said it's got some kind of brain picture on it if you can see that like I guess why I try to show at the beginning the vid way like I said once you're to that line and make sure it's there yeah look at that on like I said once it just to that line man checking you should go up the wrenches leg on put upon putting this in yes sir just like playing oh that's awesome from my first time doing this every it's cool guys I think I did a little bit full fool but hey it works right hi that's awesome rose oh [ __ ] now drop it don't [ __ ] me like comment what fake cards have you found yourself using your and my name is just reeked of to distill it but yeah call me look big what big distill it brings

Jupiter or C cell technology out sesh up John I believe like I said this is an amigo Liberty when those it's so when the models out the amigo Liberty line and there it is folks BAM that's how to refill it like I said I paid 40 bucks for this this cartridge pre-fills I paid 40 bucks for off by it so as you can see I can refill it two or three times just saying I'm gonna turn the air ducts off for a minute see how this juice actually is I'm right dumb [ __ ] Cheers amazing now it does taste more like just cannabis it's got more of an earthy aroma that's because I know flavoring this distillery got anything like that anything like the pre feel it's a lot of times that have these extra flavors attitude and a lot of additives to like be here straight I'll distill it straight to your cheap oil but yeah that's how to do it folks if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up man smash you when somebody else to see man because they've been considered whatever reason share it to him

we did it as how to refill it yes take coupling shop fire what is the same recreational grade Pentagon syringe one gram Heartland industries LLC 30 bucks I paid more for this pre-field it was 40 and

that well stick around to the end of the video I'll demonstrate it but here's what comes inside of the box you get the unit itself the heating unit and then the gun there's a couple of tubes that will show you what you use those for there's an instruction manual of course there's also going to be a power core to supply it the gun itself as you can see there a couple of tips and some additional washers and o-rings now let's take a closer look at the front of the device you'll see the LED control panel and the heating lights and the connector where you'll connect the actual heating gun itself at the back there is a rocker switch to turn the power on and off and the plug for the provided on a 20 volt outlet at the tip of the gun is where you will put the attachments there's a little pin or a needle type attachment that you'll use to fill cartridges with the middle of the gun is the chamber that's graduated to show the 25 milliliter capacity then there's a rotating dial that will let you dial the output of the gun from a half a milliliter all the way up to two and a half milliliters for different size cartridges there's a release mechanism that will let you release the plunger that pulls and pushes the oil in and out of the heated chamber at the end there also as an adaptor or a fitting where the rubber hose will go that you use to pull up the oil the function and features are pretty simple you power it on the top light the red one shows you the current temperature and then the green one at the bottom shows you the set to temperature and you hit set and then you use the arrows the directional arrow to the left to scroll between singles to ten to the hundred degree range and then the up and down arrows to set the actual temperature and then it heats up automatically [Music] and now for the usage of the gun the gun is intended for filling oil cartridges of 510 thread or what ever kind of oil cartridges the size you use but the tube that you see there is used to put down into the VAT of oil that you're using and then to draw it up into the gun you then use the trigger to push out the excess air that may have accumulated in turn filling then you put the tip on and then you set the size cartridge that you have I have half a milliliter cartridges here so I set the gun to half a milliliter and pop every time I squeeze it it puts the exact right amount into the cartridge of course this is probably for more for manufacturers than individual use but if you think you'd like to learn more about it or purchase it please visit be bail tech calm and I'd like to

my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right

cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "ZIPLMpaH-JI": "want to do like some I've not just I don't know if you guys I'm pretty sure you guys have had select cartridges before I've no they were just me if I'm just tripping but honestly like to meet all of these cartridges they kind of taste us safe so yeah they kind of have like a strong hashey taste to it some of them's up so I have I got this one for like around $35 here to attack so it's a citrus SAP you know I grabbed the citrus top because it sound like I had it you know it was like fruity so we're gonna see we're gonna see how what it tastes like you know if it's like really fruity or is it just hashey you know like the rest of them so let me know if you guys know too you know like I'm talking about if you guys have select cartridges before if they have that strong agitation or let me know so the total carnival noises 87% you know it's been a while since I don't select you know these I used to [ __ ] with select heavy I used to get one of these a lot no every week Gracie [ __ ] would select so and I don't know where I just you know like I expanded I started trying new things you don't [ __ ] it when your cartridges so I mean don't get me wrong these are pretty far you know they're still good the quality of all it was pretty good so I had done this for like 35 bucks you guys want to see the back full grams so so yeah let me know what you guys doing on this Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back you know I'm trying to get this Vito before it gets darker so you go ahead and put the button push the pushing the button but let me know if you guys [ __ ] with these stuff you guys you know these stone you guys this list some people say no some people say yeah but I don't really care you know these cartridges are still pretty good so you gonna pop it open you're gonna get a nice little seesaw cartridge I like these right here these [ __ ] rip you know out of all the cartridges they have you know there's some different kinds and [ __ ] these are one of the ones that hit the most you know you get big clouds so you go ahead and take it out so we're gonna go try hit it I'm gonna let you guys know if it's like if it's like really fruity so this is a citrus up you know I'm gonna be doing a dad in video if you guys you guys stay tuned for that you know I already done I still need an editor and [ __ ] so I probably have like two videos uploaded at once so yes stay tuned for that so here we have the whole ever know and flip it over it's pretty nice to go you know garance looks pretty good but they could do better like in the flavor why isn't she I don't know if they Todd what's the process they do it but most of these cartridges they kind of taste the same to me so yeah guys pack on this flight 35 attacks she's not bad you know so not here in Cali do the bubble test I really appreciate my new subscribers if it wasn't for you guys you guys I wouldn't be where I'm at right now you know you guys are [ __ ] awesome I'm just trying my best to like bring keep bringing our content [ __ ] for you guys you know so you guys just keep you know supporting the channel you know I really appreciate that and we're just gonna let no we're gonna let hit a hitter out this battery it's just a simple you know battery to church buddy icon from the other cartridges it's pretty good you know it's a big big [ __ ] paddy and they [ __ ] rip so we're gonna enjoy hit this and we're gonna see if there's some flavors of it yeah I'm not lying to you I can't read it tastes like that strong catchy tasting this one and that's why I kind of like stop [ __ ] with select because they just have that strong hash taste to I mean it's not bad like I said but it's like I want to taste some mouths besides I want to try some fruity that's what I grabbed the citrus tabs or they don't taste like citrusy I probably I don't know probably want to stop I'll stop buying select so we're gonna hit this cheese if you got a smoke along with me go ahead and do so bring out your bongs pies whatever the [ __ ] you guys got to KI this one along with me cheers guys yeah guys it tastes it tastes clean it tastes good but it tastes like exactly like the other cartridge I had a gun like two weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to like rock gardens and I'm know if you guys heard of bear labs I probably get like a half gram with some bear labs or I don't know this just I'm not grabbing the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things but sometimes it's just I run out of options you know but that likes Dizzy's they have plug plays I have a whole bunch of [ __ ] you know so you guys just let me know like on the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see in the future and yeah if you guys like hot box of videos you know I haven't done one yet but I will soon I'm I just haven't got the time yet so I'll probably do that tomorrow you know get out of work something and yeah guys I'm going to hit this again for you guys well yeah these cartridges right here they [ __ ] rip these see Stiles right here with the c-23 these are like one of the best cartoons you guys can have oil in because they [ __ ] [ __ ] but oil goes too quick so the high on these cartridges they're pretty good don't get me wrong you get I'm like you know you feel like the quick buzz like after like two big hits you feel like a good buzz off him this was a hybrid this one's a hybrid so you know you get the boat effects you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about so you guys let me know in a comment section if you guys like these or not so or which or which ones you guys have favorite flavor and let me know in the comments section I would I'm just curious mind guys hope you guys having a really good day and stay blessed cheers guys peace", "Wcx2GCs8YHA": "you know guys what's going on we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on select I could poke of gold or however the hell you say that first things first I just want to say if you are not over $18.00 fee here I'm sorry it's against the rules I don't know what they do but you know they can't so with that out of the way I want to say welcome back uh I wasn't postponing this video in any way whatsoever I literally this is this is the state of the cart as of last night so I uploaded that video the night I started using this and I'm gonna upload this the day I start using this so that's how long it took me to smoke that for comparison when I used to post videos on like the regular League on every other day or so my card videos I'd go through a half gram and about a day and then a full gram in about two to three if I was like really try and trying or if I was just having like a rough day or whatever I would puff through them [ __ ] I couldn't do that there's no way I would be able to do that this [ __ ] is a lot in this I don't know how little of a tolerance break two weeks is or how big of it tolerance break it is but that [ __ ] really stumped me so I think it was almost three weeks actually I'm not sure two to three weeks but I still have some in this I'll probably keep this around just to get one random time or whatever but that courts out it's old news today's card is gonna be a select card here I ripped off if you're wondering why it's missing I ripped off the sticker this is coming at ninety point five seven percent tha this is a sativa it was made on September 17 2019 so that's pretty cool here you go with your sweet-ass select carts your full grams they come with this cool little like in inter pamphlet hearing I'll try to let that focus if it will maybe nope select leaf flavors your medical marijuana enjoyment to a higher level wig with luxurious 13 infused cartridges Wow alright so obviously all saw a cool nice little kind of popped out no you don't gate so you just kind of pop it up there you go that's gone it's old news doesn't come with a little cap unfortunately all no big fan of the caps big fan of keeping [ __ ] clean that's just me you know I don't like dirty dirty anything um comes with a little bottom cap crazy I know your jupiter-c so standard whatever all that good [ __ ] the only thing I don't like so far as I have to fat ass Bobo's right there at the bottom because I think this was laying sideways the box and they just kind of sat there and said so hopefully a hopefully the ventas will pick up off that side we have the dr. zodiacs moon rock a moon rock a moon rock battery I have the other one charging back here but they don't think it wants to hold a charge for some reason so we're gonna kick it back with this bad boy are you go ahead and screw it on here this is gonna be the first high to date it's only let's see 9:01 a.m. I just woke up you know took care of my dogs I like my cats right here on the floor by the way this [ __ ] ah right here we got homie he doesn't want to be here up so we're gonna let it go uh yeah so this is a wake and bake session we're just chilling we got some good ass cold cold liquids here so you already know it's gonna be a nice time all right all right let's enjoy this chill Saturday you guys go cheers let me know if you're smoking anything down down there you all know you already know the deal just keep myself over and over again all right trigger okay yeah this is definitely no [ __ ] there's no flavor whatsoever when it comes to this except for it's just like cook so [ __ ] [ __ ] yep there it is hydration break yeah I know that's a very strong taste out [ __ ] I'm is very strong very good though I do like push sometimes not all the times it's it's like a hit or miss with me so this one's definitely a hit I like it I don't like it at the same time no I'll say that so that's something to look out the oil of this see if I can tell the difference looks to be pretty consistent with the last one color wise if you can kind of tell the Lighting's a little hard to pick up on the smaller one because there's not as much so we hold it this way baby so it's pretty much the same consistency it's just hard to tell because there's so little of this one same same color maybe maybe this one's got a little bit more of an amber ish tint looks like came straight at a Jurassic Park like there's a [ __ ] mosquito in this [ __ ] or some but these things these ones are both very thick oils like they they don't they don't move pretty easy they gotta be sat there like this one has been standing all night and there's still a still small divot right there that it's still trying to fill so select is definitely putting out some top ass [ __ ]

me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks for watching brothers and sisters leave me a comment let me know what you think you like the strain you try to before you don't like the strain let me know why you don't like it you think I'm right think I'm wrong I read all your comments I

safe taking care of each other and above all everyone keeps smoking", "wWN8KL2KLvQ": "although friends have we doing it's been a decently long time since I did a video I apologize for that you know it's just like anybody you sometimes you struggle with content that one of release really good content so it's just been a few minutes since I release and stuff today's video I get a lot of questions about is what are we going to do with your leftover carts and we get a lot of these you know questions about these cartridges there's so many of them there's a bunch of different ways they connect together and really but it's really quite simple you can definitely get inside the carts even if there's a lip just a little bit of oil less than that we want to make sure we're using all that yeah this is a very expensive program and using all your medicine efficiently is really what's going to make that make or break it one month to the next without further ado you're gonna need a few things so I got what I did is I put a hook up excuse me a couple different cartridges together just show you different brands who we got here we got standard forms brand cartridge we got GTI brand cartridge and then we have a Terrapin brand cartridge right these are simple they just screw off they're not hard I'll do one for you right now this particular one is GTI and you just squeeze here and rotate righty-tighty lefty-loosey real easy to way to remember don't you get that off that's your trash this is what you're going save now some of you might be wondering what in the hell are you gonna do with that that that's gonna be worth my medicine there's a got a lot of things you can do you could soak it alcohol you can soak it in warm dump MCT oil or like tonight what I'm going to do tonight is I'm gonna heat up a little bit of high fat milk on the stove and once it's up the temperature I'm gonna drop like no no like 10 of these and there mix it together you'll start to see the milk turn like you know an amber color if you use the llars or the co2 carts how about them light tint to it that's your indicator that nicely you know this is already smoked up you know and you just kind of stir it in there you know not overheat this is something we made out of so it does get warm so it's okay to begin something that is warm you know you don't want to go ahead and throw them in the milk turn the milk on high and boil the cart in the metal together I don't recommend that I always heat up my milk and one for my milk is that temperature which is just slightly similar in our a little bit of bubbles I'll go ahead and throw it in there I'll mix that together add a few little bit of a chocolate then I'll mix that together but that's in a different video we'll do that specifically for the other brand cartridges like let's see we got here like your moxie carts or your LLR carts yes Koecher tangi whoa love it best corn ever and then you got your where these that's your outage this is your another one of those Cresco carts as well all right so we got that banks are you know what to say in a christelle cart this is actually a grassroot cart so these three carts here have compression fittings and this is why you're going to need these two tools and the two tools I'm speaking about today it's just like pair of vise grips pair of needle-nosed that's all I'm going to show you how I'm going to take this apart let's move this camera down here to see these guys are able to see what's going on on the table alright so once I've worked with a lot are these crest coats like I said kosher tangi you know sorry everybody all character changing is my favorite cartridge in the whole program it's amazing if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you check it out we're gonna want to do this right where that strip is you're going to get that in your vice grips now if when you initially put that down there I can't squeeze that it's too tight you don't want to squeeze it too tight so then you're just gonna loosen this up which is gonna allow you to lock that end see that and without holding it it's gonna not fall out and we want it to not be able to be wiggled either because if this is you can wiggle this that means it's not tight enough even if there's a little bit of play in there we want to make sure you got as much tightness as possible you know without squishing it okay so that's how that's going to look and then you can try a couple different ways you can put it on here and just work your way back and forth slowly but surely you don't want to squeeze this metal piece here bat metal piece if you squeeze that a bunch of times you're gonna make it hard for yourself I come out here or what I do another good trick is to stick your needle nose inside there put a flap down on the table and just give it back and forth little Wiggles stabilize your base of your car just so if it becomes an issue you can get it out what I like to do is increase the tightness on the court remember you don't want to squeeze you don't want to squish it and then and as you can see I'm squishing the crap out of the top of that but sometimes that's what's needed if you just wiggle back and forth boom off cam your piece and as you can see the end is good and I squeezed out of there and now I can gain access to all my compression fitting carts with all my medicine in there and that's what that end piece looks like I know you ladies are gonna ask me where I where I got this sweet little robber thing for the car actually a buddy of mine and 3d printed it for me my man Eman you're the man dude thank you so much that's awesome all right so just dump gonna do one more a couple one more here with these twisties just so you can see it up close just kind of twist it that's it if that has a bunch of stuff on there you can even throw that in just don't throw any rubber in and buy rubber you'll see like that sometimes I had this little rubber piece or they come on the bottom you don't want to go thread up and there don't kind of get in your way I know another one of the carts that have a big problem is these Moxie carts I'll do one more of these just to show you squeeze it right there clamp it down stick your partner map there we go squeeze the crap out of that hmm actually the moxie was easy easier to get often the crest Gallic has like it's like a little rubber piece so it just kind of flexed off on me which is nice that's pretty cool now you just kind of repeat this process until you get a bunch of carts opened any stuff you can move away from the top you feel free to do so but all that hot liquid is gonna get inside these carts so you can just leave these open like that and believe it or not there's another thing you can do now I don't recommend anyone just doing this but you can definitely get one of those extractor kits with the hollow needles and just suck up as much oil as you can honestly this is I've did that before this is still the best way I've ever figured out how to use my empty carts it's very efficient people are gonna ask me what's your dosing size generally when I do this I'm doing this on a Saturday or day I know I'm gonna have off I'm gonna do about five to ten carts that have a little tiny bit of oil if you get one like especially the standard forms ones oh wow I caught that you see how much of that is up there that's a lot of will right so maybe on this batch if I have something that has that thick that much oil at the top caked on there I might drop it down one or two carts just cuz I know it's gonna be pretty strong that day you know and then you know like I said I'll be making more videos and I want to definitely make a video on how to actually put these in some form of edible or drink and I will definitely be doing a video that in the future so thank you every much everybody thank you for watching take care of yourself and each other and hang loose", "IBB1abU3tBo": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with another west coast we tour review today's special guest jazzy reviewing the flav rx or i'm sorry it's no longer a flavor rx just the flav one milliliter premium refined cannabis oil ultra slim disposable and rechargeable i said it disposable and rechargeable all all-in-one oil pod and battery so this is lemon hey sativa convenient yeah this is this is super cool it is basically a disposable pen that is a full gram and it is rechargeable so we are here i'm going to open it up you let them know what the what is the say on the like the strain the the lemon haze okay this classic packaging pretty dope and then we look and dropped it here we're looking at the uh the actual device you can see the color of the oil a little bit is gold outside see if we can get out there and there you go nice little gold paint it's beaut it's a beautiful little vape almost looks like a usb drive nice and slick you know it reminds me of jules it honestly does it just reminds me of jewels so one hit review i'm gonna talk about it two hits four out of ten full review available on respectmyregion.com slave doing it big coming in hot working too hard rip it too hard yeah it doesn't say it doesn't oh it does have ingredients uh it says ultra refined cannabis oil so ultra refined is going to be distillate uh just as terpenes and then it says instructions press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking a three second drop oops so too big of a draw there that was probably fine misusing it is a common thing in vapes so here we go so you get a fat rip it's definitely potent you can taste the fruity terpenes tastes botanical does not taste like weed yeah definitely tastes like fruits and whatever else natural terps it's a little harsh it's a little harsh i'm sure it was hard for you because you took a long one yeah um i think someone who likes flavored things would probably like those products it rips i mean manufactured 722 it's going to be good until next year 7 22. i'm high you're high off that first i mean 86.84 total cannabinoids is a potent product in regards to you know thc in the best of the world it's not in the 90s by any means but when you combine some good terpenes um it can really get the job done so yeah it's so light it's very it's very light i i like i like how it feels i like how it hits um i like how it's branded i like the flavor there on both sides i think it's super dope it's a little slick for me i would like it to be a little bit more coarse and it does light up here in green when you do hit it on the second hit it's still pretty harsh for botanical terpenes and a disposable vape i think yeah it's definitely harsh look at the quality product would i recommend it not to anybody that wants live resumes or someone that wants the best of the best i think this is great for someone who's on the go very discreet maybe a cbd distillate vapor someone who is really looking for that super lemon haze like if super lemon haze is your favorite this tastes really good doesn't taste like real weed but it does taste really good so i'd say it's worth checking out score out of 10 though a flat eight for me i'm at a 7.5 maybe even a seven it just comes down to the packaging doesn't say what kind of terpenes it is doesn't give you the terpene profile and then the harshness like it just leads into this slippery slope of if you would have just told us that it was botanical terps and i would know in fact what it is and why it's happening oh nothing too just rechargeable disposable on their instagram um price point wise it's not even that expensive either so i mean if your you know disposables are your thing and you want to recharge it and um i don't know why you don't want to i mean i don't think you can change out the pod on this so i'm keeping my eight because it's just like it's convenient it's a full gram so maybe it's gonna die before you rip through the full ram i guess it's rechargeable but it can still die you just have to recharge it that's what i'm saying i feel like 7.5 final score for me i think it is what it is shout out to flav dope product uh definitely go check it out you guys this is another west coast week two review mail we're just keeping it real jazzasaurus j ping respect my region this is the west coast weed tour we are

see you on the road", "DMdIS3YSdwY": "hi my name is Peter I'm with transferring USA and today I am proud to present to you the transferring bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering customization installation and ongoing maintenance for this machine also in the meantime be sure to subscribe to our channel as we post more videos about how to clean this machine calibrate it and customize it for your particular operation I want to thank you for watching and stay posted for more informative videos about the transferring vape cartridge autofilter machine", "P1fsgq0iFEk": "[Music] it's mad at profile stereos welcome to cat abases today we answer the question what is a box behind fate this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can get a free gift with a code rough two on any product you purchased there including the Steam Cloud box mod like we used in the video today so what is a box mod vape box mod vapes are essentially vaporizers with advanced features and high-capacity batteries you get extra long life for those batteries and the extended power range that it needs to accommodate large tanks for ecig juice and also for the large puffs that many serious vapors chase after it was actually the ecig market that first popularized box mod vaporizers but because they're also great for travel with their big batteries and because they're powerful and will operate the numerous attachments for cannabis they're also growing in popularity with marijuana users as well you could find attachments for using dry herb wax as well as the THC and CBD oils and they're also compatible with almost all of the 510 thread cartridges so why would you choose a box mod vape for one of the big removable batteries make it easy to replace or upgrade the batteries you can also keep a spare battery charged making it great for long trips and for extended use the ability to have such a wide variable wattage range allows you to use the large tanks with the custom wrapped coils the things that the serious papers and the cloud chasers go after but it also allows you to lower down the wattage to use it with the smaller cartridges and coils so you have really maximum compatibility box mods really offer maximum compatibility with attachments when it's compared directly with other types of vaporizers and not only are many attachments made exclusively for box mods but most of the others that are not made exclusively for them will work with them if you adjust the settings of the box mod appropriately and so what kind of attachments do work with the box mods so you have dry herb attachments where basically usually just a ceramic oven that's inside of the attachments for the Box mod you have the wax atomizers which are the coil atomizers that you would use if your atomizing wax or shatters crumbles and things of that nature then you have the big tanks or the ecig or ejuice tanks and these can be infused with cannabis but also they could just be your regular nicotine or just standard flavored juices and then what really makes them great is that they're compatible with almost all of the 510 thread cartridges and so those are your prefilled THC or CBD type oil cartridges and those are really the rage these days and means that they work with those it's really great but there are some things you have to be careful of and that brings us to the drawbacks so what are the drawbacks of box mods well one is that they can be expensive compared with your standard single-use vaporizers that could be quite a bit more expensive but to most of us it's worth the cost another drawback is that there can be a little bit of a learning curve to use them because they allow you to use a really high wattage or a low wattage but if you use high wattage on devices that aren't used intended for it you can hurt your devices and so that's the last drawback that I'm going to point out is that you can burn up your atomizers if you use too high a wattage and that is specifically or particularly true when it comes to the 510 thread cartridges most of those want wattages down into two to eight watt range but you know if you put your papers up on 25 and 30 Watts you'll burn up your cartridge really quickly so that's one of the drawbacks of it okay well I hope you enjoyed this video on what is a box mod again this video was sponsored by a New York vape

connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "NyP7r-0VY4U": "hell trevor here with write a leaf and today we're going to be tapping into a 510 cartridge for this review we've got phyto extracts fire stick 2.0 it's their pink kush dislip pen i'm really excited to try this out and see how it does y'all let's get into it we'll see on the other side when we're tapping off the little bit of info that's on here before we get into the full on urban scale see on the other side cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into fido extracts pink kush 510 cartridge so this sucker came in with a thc total of 79.1 percent it's got zero cbd in it and it was packaged on the 15th of may 2020 i'm just gonna start pulling it apart while we're chatting through the information so we've got the lift and co website pulled up with this information you guys so we'll uh run all that off before we tap into this beautiful looking car so we've got pink kush 510 cartridge pink kush is an indica dominant hybrid that much like it's close relative og kush delivers a sweet aroma accompanied by a distinct herbal taste these point five gram distillate cartridges are made from food grade all natural terpenes with zero fillers and additives it contains 75 to 85 thc and no cbd we use top of the line c cell cartridges that features a ceramic heating element when filled this heating element absorbs up to 0.15 milliliter of the 0.5 mil of oil contained in the cartridge this can lead to the appearance of a head space at the top of the cartridge each of our cartridges are auto filled by weight to ensure that you receive exactly 0.5 of oil with 100 accuracy we need to get that thc sticker off there so we'll throw that on the torch while we uh rattle off the oh they don't have any more information you guys so uh i'm going to stick this on the torch while we uh do the urban scale intro and then we'll tap into this cartridge y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh

content you", "PgNhqH5H8nQ": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be reviewing a cartridge brand that i've had a couple people asking for in the comments and asking about um the uh the brand that i've got today is called green dragon extracts and the line of distillate specifically is called dragonglass distillate so let me turn this around and let you see the packaging and then i'll get into it and tell you what i think all right so here's the packaging it comes in um the story i got is cascade orange 87 cannabinoids total and you can see all the markings they got there green dragon on the left side or the right side and you got the window on the other then here's the cannabinoid info and the terpene info which i really like this one looks to be mostly beta pharmacine which i'm pretty happy about that's a pretty tasty terpene and then you got some more production info and then their license info and their website let's pull it open and see what's inside big empty box besides the tube it's pretty common let's get the tube out here and the tube itself has stickers um with just all the required production info so here's the cartridge itself a little different than a lot of the ones that i'm used to looks like it has an adjustable airflow feature right here yeah that's pretty cool um take that off the oil looks pretty good alrighty let's give it a try all righty let's get into the cart here it is screwed into my vessel took the shroud off just in case um it didn't fit but i may have actually i didn't even check i'll get this turned on here i'm going to try it first we got the settings the airflow i showed you got three holes that you can yeah three holes you can cover up there so um i'm gonna try it with the holes open first not bad at all um tastes pretty good on it i'm pretty sure they use cannabis derived terpenes for this they taste natural um it just it does taste strongly of i would say like apple to orange you know it's very fruity very fruity i wouldn't say um i know it does taste like orange now that's wild so um i haven't ever i don't think i've ever had had anything that's almost like entirely pharmacy in like this one um very good terpene though let's try this out um with none of the hole showing just this down i'm pretty excited about this because i've tried these one time roughly like a year and a half ago and i had a lot of issues i think it might have been my battery or something because i couldn't get much of a hit out but even with the air holes open i was getting a very nice hit so it'll probably be better now no issues at all that's very thick paper in fact let me try it out i might find a sweet spot that i like with like one hole that's perfect um yeah these are really cool um if you like especially the adjustable airflow i'd say that's its selling point because it is just distillate it is very well priced as well um the dyspo i go to also has some of some enjoy oils for the same price and i like the live cannabis terpenes if i'm going for distillate so i usually have been choosing those but i honestly if they have some flavor or some strains that i like i'll probably start grabbing these these are not bad at all not what i was you know not what i experienced before thick enough to blow rings so that shows if you were wondering at all so i mean i don't know what else to say um it's hard to really say much about distillate cards because they don't even have that you know wide of a range of effects it's pretty flat compared to a full spectrum extract and for carts i usually do buy um just distillate i will buy live resin for my dabs but yeah so um i've been trying to get some new dabs as well so um i'll start making new videos but i definitely want to try and finish off the low range of carts that i haven't tried including this one got a couple more one more for a posterity all right so um my opinion these are a really good card the package looks a little sketchy i don't know why it just yeah you know it really doesn't it looks pretty professional just like the artwork i guess but it's just more minimalist it's now it's a really good card i would recommend these if they have them in the store pick them up try them out you wouldn't you won't be disappointed i'll tell you that much so thank you for watching um i should be having another video at least very soon if it's not even about carts because i won the vessel weekly giveaway which is two vessel pins you can choose four different types wood expedition um two others okay so i don't remember but anyways you can choose four uh two vessels and a rover case which is a total of 183 dollars and i got that for free because i entered whenever i bought my vessel and i don't even think you have to purchase to enter and i forgot about it for four or five months and here it is like i got the email the other day that i'm getting some really cool free stuff so and really good pins as well so you'll be seeing those in some of my new videos shout out to vessel brand highly recommend them you've seen them in all my cart videos and for a reason it's the best pen that i've used so far so look forward to those videos if you enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and thanks for watching hope you have a great day", "ivRTpxFMtmE": "so what's going on guys we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on another kart the venom X this one is the pomegranate paradise sativa so with uh with that intro already done let's go ahead and let you guys know that this channel is a smoking cannabis channel only so if you're not 21 and older 18 and 21 depending on your state you can't watch this video it's age restricted or some some some I don't know I don't know YouTube doing me dirty with this but sorry so well now we can start the review like I said so it's the pomegranate paradise it's the venom X this is the first venom X we've reviewed on the channel I did like a week or two ago have two venom X's they were actually the same exact one they were supposed to be different but the girl gave me the same ones for some reason so that was whatever but I just didn't make a video and I explained why in another video so go watch that one um but this one I don't think it says anything about like what percent it is oh no it does this is meeting with 100% all-natural terpenes C cell technology but bought 85% - you see right there in the middle marade there we got it on the doctor's odx battery here it's pretty well charged when I was when I got this it was supposed to be like really fruity that was supposed to be the flavor like a fruity kind of earthy taste but after hitting it for like the last few hours like a day like I've had for a day I notice that it's very very cush it's just straight clutch taste so if you like those go for it but the high on this thing is probably the happiest ha I think I've ever gotten out of any car especially or out of any sativa especially any card this thing just smacked me like in a good way and I was like fully chilling the whole time but I just felt really good I was in some good vibes you know I'm saying so I got like hair they're mangroves if you guys like sativas um and you really want to get like a really good happy high like feel great moment I highly recommend this car venom X pomegranate paradise it is solid for that I haven't felt that that like great high in a long time and this one definitely did it so let's go ahead and take one one good couch off this bad boy and yeah let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments melesa interested to know so twos guys yeah I mean it I I will say there is like a little bit of a fruity taste maybe like pomegranate maybe a small hint of it but it's very cushy maybe a small hint of erythema like that that like weird you know the taste I don't want to say it's earthy but that's how everybody describes it but y'all know what the taste is but it has a little bit of those too but it's mainly cush to me that's at least my personal taste you guys might taste a little something different right sorry to me here like little noises in the back I just got a puppy I'm fostering and he's a little Brad so it makes a lot of noise I mean when yeah this thing's I'm already feeling a little little hot and body I already for sure head high a little a little bit I'm gonna feeling chill you don't here's the wax it's a really nice golden color beautiful background huh 10 out of 10 it is pretty solid they're pretty thick pretty damn thick no there was a deal it was a to 440 the homie uh-uh he the big the big homie got ice play with me so we went 20 20 and he got a cart shoutouts to him you got the same cart and I don't know how to say let's just shoot you another one guys cuz that's all I can say Oh yo so real quick so it's October right Oh in September Jesus Christ but it's September so it's almost Halloween to you that means that Halloween serials in season Nash it's the best so let me know which one's your favorite there's like Count Dracula or whatever the chocolate one a cocoa dragon track you cannot what it's called there's Franken berry and then Boo Berry let me know which one's your favorite I'm personally a Franken berry I think Don's left I think I was like tops for sure and then boo Berryman choco vampire [ __ ] whatever told mm-hmm but that's just me that's just me those are some bomb-ass cereals oh for sure for sure well well [ __ ] there is a little bubble right there and one thing I have noticed after hitting it when you do create a bubble like that inside the card it kind of hits off that bubble again so you kind of get like the weird battery like fume taste so it's kind of ideal if you can let the bubble move a bit that would be I that would be a bad deal but if not you know you can still get a pretty decent draw off it for sure for sure well let's take another one you choose yeah you know what I want to do for you guys I want to do a for one of the strings Saturdays or screen Sundays or whatever it is his move his battery's getting all my little one well for one of the streets after it is do like a Keith pre-roll or something like that like a full like Granberry Keith line or like a 3.5 grant that would be dope the I I'm not really ever smoked a chief joint at all I don't even know if Keith blunts it really made it often but I'm more of a joint kind of guy anyway but definitely man wow my lungs right there I definitely really want to smoke occasionally they look so fired or a moon rock a Zodiac moonwalk one of those those pre-rolls are expensive but I'm definitely found if you guys lend me one and see one of those I gotta find a dispro that hassle near me but I'm sure that'll be pretty damn easy I think that was three is that three yeah well I think yeah here she I'll kind of show you there's the bubble right it's just it got bigger it didn't like Oh to any other one I don't really know if he can do that maybe if I switch switch it a little bit if I open it a little bit more like not so tight no I'm saying it might be blocking a little bit of airflow let's see well I wasn't I feel like a lot more smoke and normal for sure Richard Oh ma'am that was interesting I don't know if I that was a good good idea or what I just I've always had it pretty tight so I just kind of loosened it so there's like a little bit more air fall but enough connection to get a hit yeah definitely hearing more air flow going through for sure well what interesting I'm gonna mess around with that a little more see how that works and see what happens there but I think that's a wrap for this video guys I hope you guys had a Wow Jesus Christ I am stupid I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did go ahead and give me a like or subscribe that would be awesome comments are always dope I always reply to all of them you guys are super dope on all the last ones you guys pretty much left comments on every single one except for like one which is totally chill for me but yeah I love to love the feedback so it's always good to hear with all that done and like for kids there's on them feeling feeling a real nice here real nice so I'm probably gonna put on some music by about some games or you know YouTube whatever maybe but yeah I'll see you guys in the next one deuces have go", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope you enjoyed the video, and thanks for joining us .We really look forward to seeing you again.", "lXefqGQGGvQ": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you you", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "2Oupus4iOBI": "you - what's up

court Raju's powerful this thing here I don't like it it has that fake flavoring just good for making so many cartridges that I do I just I got a rule I don't like that taste anymore like I like the original flavor like if I make a cartridge with just regular plain no flavoring original and you get the string taste I like but then you go throwing that Terps in there man the fainter whatever I'm not even getting like lit I'm not one of my favorites but you know what it is and to be honest with you this year our F sub Davin s stuff only the grassroots triple distill yeah me too I just that I don't like got pen at all I'd stay away from it the Clementine one that was 80 some percent was good that one they're not so good but we're gonna dab a little bit of RS Oh birthday cake I'm totally [

what's up everybody it's your boy heaven sent this is my smoking channel today's video i'm going to be doing a cart review for you guys it's a canadian cart uh it's lemon cherry gelato by farms canada carts premium vape carts net weight 0.5 grams has a little government warning on the back um cost me about 30 bucks for the half gram at the dyspo 28 dollars to be exact let's go ahead and uh pop it open you just slide it down like this and then the carts right inside pop it i don't really smell anything coming from the cart i got my ooze twist battery right here blue and red i'm gonna put it on [Music] the rubber gasket on the top and the rubber gasket on the bottom i'll take both of those off got the top one off see if i can taste anything coming from the carp i taste absolutely nothing coming from this car wow this isn't this isn't a good sign i taste zero flavors coming from this car i've never tasted zero flavors coming from a cart before wow nice oil kind of looks like live resin it's not live resin though i believe it's distillate but um i'm gonna go ahead and uh start hitting this card the only way i know how i'm gonna take a blinker you guys see if it gets me faded see if i cough see what happens you guys hopefully it makes me die hopefully we'll see cheers [Music] it's going to be a whole lot of trouble today believe that okay so like i kind of expected it doesn't taste like lemon or cherry i didn't expect it it doesn't taste like lemon or cherry i kind of expected there to be a slight lemon taste or a slight cherry taste of the cart but no it's mostly a gelato taste it's mostly a pure cannabis flower taste to the carrot [Music] so if you're picking up this card expecting a fruity flavors off of it you're going to be disappointed kind of like i was or kind of like i am right now but um that it's not too bad i'm used to smoking carts with live resin terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes botanical terpenes are not a problem fruit terpenes are only uh it's added to the distillate cards sometimes and i understand that but um yeah let's uh go ahead and hit it one more time i'll go ahead and uh rate the taste rate the potency and then uh yeah as far as for the looks i'm not sure if it's live resin or distillate it looks like live resin um it says nothing about being um live resin or distillate on the cart but if it is live resin it's not bad at all um for what it is 79 thc not bad if it's distillate i'd like to see the thc percentage uh put up a little higher um if it's a live resin i'm going to rate the looks probably like a a 10 out of 10 but if it's a distillate gotta rate those looks probably like a seven out of ten i'm unsure as to what it is if it's distillate with live resin terpenes or if it's just live resin it may just be live resin you guys um but i'm not sure if anybody knows in the comment section um be sure to let me know i'm gonna go ahead and hit it a couple times and let me let you guys know what the taste is like [Music] [Music] yeah it's um mostly a cannabis taste entirely a cannabis taste no lemon or cherry or any fruit terpenes used [Music] if you're someone who enjoys the taste of cannabis you're definitely going to enjoy these cards i myself will enjoy the car regardless um i just thought that it may have had lemon or cherry inside of it um but i was wrong um as far as for a live resin cart it's really good the potency is uh right up there with what it should be um so i'd give it uh i already rated it for that um no i didn't read it for potency i rated it for looks for potency if it's a distillate then i have to give it a seven again but if it's a live resin i'm gonna give it a nine for potency because it's um pretty decent it's just not the best [Music] i gotta say nowadays it is becoming harder to tell whether you have a live resin or distillate product even if you have a distillate product sometimes it may say live resin on it or even if you have a live resin product sometimes they may say distilled on it um things are getting um pretty uh difficult to determine in the cannabis industry but that's just how everything's going for a reason [Music] i don't want this video to take too long guys i just want to give you a review on canadian carts lemon cherry gelato overall not too bad of a car pretty decent when i pick it up again i don't think so i stick with uh other companies that are more just a better quality and it tastes a little bit better to me but um overall not a bad car you guys enjoyed this video so far make sure to slap the like button down below you guys have any

know that I slapped on some sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple type you should hide Apple Express or some [ __ ] but you know you you just know you're getting the extract from this sharing or from some legit pineapple Express you know the book is lit man if you guys owe a good thing I would I would totally recommend this brand and this these cartridges it's like cartridges especially if you guys don't want to if you don't wanna like hotbox your room or some [ __ ] you guys are burning like in the bathroom real quick you guys have a quick sesh you know cuz the smell isn't that strong there's no like stick to it like rock gardens oh my god they have like a crazy like leafy it's it's a [ __ ] it's it's a strong a smell on the other [ __ ] you know they have they have strong smells of [ __ ] down [ __ ] late cuz I do not shut the [ __ ] up I got a chatterbox anyways you guys thanks for watching like always soon everything we have from dispensary man in Italy some flowers so thank you guys for watching like always if you guys did enjoy make sure

yeah", "A2k1Q7rTNJg": "hey everybody its cannon Joe we are checking in today at Stinson Beach California one of our last days out in California and today we are very excited to review a Willys reserve distillate cartridge this is Mountain mist this is the flavor and we were super lucky enough to be introduced to a woman that basically gave us these and donated these products here to us from Flo Canada and we are very very excited to try this Willy's reserve as a Willie Nelson brand and of course everybody hears about that and they want to try it out and here today we are about to so let's just go ahead and get in on it so we've got our warnings of course this is awesome packaging I really like it local farmers you can check it out online recyclable packaging that's cool yeah this is nice packaging everything's nice I like the colors really stands out they did a good job they're got Willie Nelson in the background right there that's cool 81 percent THC again this is a distillate and then you've got 0.33% of CBD so oh I like that big packaging there I've never seen one like this now okay but you take that out like that wow this is this is a heavy-duty case right here [Music] okay that was an extremely long horn blow again we are at a beach so it's probably the get in or get out of the water call so here we go this cartridge is very high-quality we've got like a stainless steel feel here on the mouth tip it's a very large hole this is uh it's heavy too it's got the WR right there on the right there on the logo and so we're gonna just go ahead and try it out here see what happens okay here we go mmm that's good lemony hmm Wow mmm that's got everything you're looking for I mean it's got the Terp tic it's got the back of the throat choke it's got the whole tickle in the nose it's got pretty much everything but it's not bad in any way shape or form because a lot of the times that all those things can go into a bad you know they can be too much term tech too much choke throughout all them things that you don't want but this is pretty much all that you do let's try this again just get one more try see what really happens excuse me I didn't expect that okay who's that my friends excuse me all right so you want to be careful with this this is no joke this is not a joke this is the lowest temp a lot of times with your vape pens you know you can take the whole hit sometimes maybe even two you can time out the pin to really get the flavor saver going but this one here no this is a one I mean you can barely get through one time out with this and yeah I feel I feel a little on the road again so yeah I definitely appreciate this this is an awesome pin I give it pretty much a 10 let's give it a 10", "PvqNwla4YIc": "what is on canna fam and welcome back to another product review video so check it out guys for this video I have here a 1 gram cartridge here by Northwest kind and this is a 1 gram cartridge distillate I believe it's a distillate it actually I can't find anywhere on the package to confirm this but I'm almost like 99% sure this is a distillate ok so let's just go with that anyway so this is by Northwest kind this is gorilla snacks alright the gorillas hungry and this is his neck ok and this is coming in at a 88 percent THC so not [ __ ] bad that's almost in the 90s that's pretty damn good ok I had a little to know CBD ok doesn't say anything here about terpenes so I can't give you guys that information unfortunately but hey 88 percent THC not bad I'll take it alright so the gorilla snacks 100% cannabis extract and we're gonna go ahead and pull this out here does it say no it doesn't even say on there so I was just checking to see if it said distillate or co2 or something like that alright gonna set that in there so we don't lose it and this is our cartridge what do you guys think I pull that little rubber end off there let me see if I can get up a better view for you guys like this come on there we go look at that there we go nice shot there BAM very nice cartridge if I don't say so myself very nice color got their logo on it got the Cannabis thing on there I'm gonna say right off the bat before I try this and get into more of the review I kind of don't like that that kind of throws me off already the fact that this has got like that's not a sticker usually it's a sticker you can peel it off and whatnot but I mean I guess you could I guess you could sit here and kind of scrape it off see how I'm doing right there you can kind of if you really want to my only issue with that when they actually print it on the cartridge like that is one of the main reasons that we purchase these carts is for the discreteness okay this is because it's discrete people you know we can have these out kind of in public even though we're not supposed to and kind of just you know take our hits kind of get our medicine and stuff like that as we need throughout the day but when you have something like that that's like permanently printed on there it takes the discreet away you could be sitting here hitting this thing somebody looks over sees that logo and they're like oh oh oh you smell good way oh my god get him you know what I mean like I'm just saying like I just one of the big things about this for me at least I know for a lot of other people is the fact that you know they're discreet okay so and that kind of takes it away from me so I'm just gonna throw that out there that's just kind of my one negative so far with this but anyway this is a normal 510 thread okay so it's gonna fit most standard batteries okay which I have right here nice battery here this one screws in it's not a plug in at the bottom it's got the different two different temperature settings on it and we just screw this on ever so easy just like that we'll pay mo all right so here we go now off for me I usually do to hit hit too long hits off this okay so I'll hold the button down for 10 seconds until it flashes then I you know hold it again another 10 seconds so about 20 second draw okay that's what I like now for you I don't recommend that if you know you're somebody who can't handle a good amount of smoke then I would recommend maybe just doing the 10 seconds just the normal one time draw but for me I have to do it two times so here we go this is the gorilla snacks by Northwest kind much-loved guys thank you for watching my video [Music] well I say wow because I didn't have to actually hold the button down twice you see that cloud this this is good cart this is a good cart good cart a little bit of a cough to it but hey good cart tastes good I definitely get that gorilla glue that kind of like stinky gorilla glue you know what I mean like that it's really good I really like it it's not super pungent it's not like mouth watering turps okay it's not gonna mmm - so good you know it's not like that okay it's just mild it's a mild flavor on the terpenes you get it it's not all there like it could be but you still get something okay highs pretty good we're gonna go for round two on this now really quick I have my temperature setting because this has three different temperatures on it Green being the lowest blue being medium and red being the highest temp I have it set on blue so this is a medium temp it gives me a good enough hit without that you know if you put it on red and you kind of get like a nasty taste to it it kind of feels like a burnt taste you know what I mean and so I feel like blue is the safest bet because you still get a good big hit and yet you still taste the terpenes you still all that now if you want to get the full spectrum of those terpenes if you want to get the full flavor then I would recommend probably going to the green setting if you don't mind sacrificing a little bit of your smoke you know cuz it will be a smaller cloud of smoke that I highly recommend going to the green set okay but anyway I'm on the blue set we're in the middle all right here we go [Music] [Music] that's pretty good got a little kick to it I like it I'm a big fan of like guerrilla glue or guerilla snacks or Scooby Snacks or anything like that so this was right up my alley this was $36 recreationally here in the state of Oregon for this gram cartridge this is a full gram cartridge for only $36 here in the state of Oregon of course if your medical you're going to get it cheaper and I highly recommend it I really do I mean I really really do this gets two big thumbs up with me and let me tell you why even though even though it was lacking on the turkeys it was still there it's not like there was none you still got them they're just not like super pungent okay the fact that it's $36 for a full gram let me say that again $36 for a full gram okay that is amazing the fact that it's eighty-eight percent THC you can take a hit or two off this thing and actually feel it it actually feel it it's got a good high it's got a good nice relaxing high to it I could definitely see me like taking several hits of this before bed or something like that or before I need to like relax because it's definitely making me like just one eye just chill just just chill so I like it that's why all right the only thing the only thing that I really don't like about this is the fact that that's printed on right there I don't like that I really don't it takes away from it being discreet okay if I'm like somewhere you know outside of somewhere do you know a weight and smoking my [ __ ] bait pen and somebody looks over somebody who's not cool with cannabis or whatever you know some uptight [ __ ] sees this and then BOOM oh he's smoking in public you know what I mean and so I feel like - should be taken away okay part of the reason people buy these carts is because they're discreet you know they're easy to use they're discreet if you're somebody who travels a lot if you're somebody who's on the go if you're somebody who likes to go out and see nature while they get stoned stuff like that then these carts are gonna be perfect for you they're easy to handle they're very easy to maneuver they don't really have malfunctions most of the time okay if you get the good carts anything like in my opinion anything thirty-five dollars or so and up here in the state of Oregon not speaking for other states but here in Oregon and they say anything thirty-five dollars and up should be a good cart and I'm talking about the actual cart not the product inside should be a good cart okay anything lower than that you're gonna probably have malfunction problems okay I've had the $25.00 carts and I ended up sucking the whole gram through it got all over my teeth and mouth it sucked it sucked okay I tell you guys you don't want dabs in your mouth and on your teeth it sucks so just keep that in mind okay that's just a little bit of a advice when you go cart shopping and I would highly recommend picking this one okay that's what does the videos about so check out

throughout the pandemic we've seen it drop down to 50. and so because of the price point the quality the ease of use um the long duration of the charge i'm going to give this product a 9.5 where i

is a warranty so i got to give them that super cool um but i'm sitting at a 9.5 a device as good as this needs to be out there more they got to do more content you got to do more education i need to

day out today it's nice I mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost almost every [ __ ] battery out there and like I said man just

today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can

because all this is coming up soon and if you like this you're not going to want to miss what's coming up next enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be

content today we're doing a review on Mary's distillate by Mary's medicinals it's the THC blend so there's no strain I wouldn't get the starter kit you can't get the cartridge by itself now if you're not familiar with Mary's medicinals they're based out of Colorado that are known for their effective and award-winning products this is what the cartridge looks like 500 milligram as you can see I've been medicating it is rolling with the ceramic black flat mouthpiece one thing about Mary's dis lid is on very simple as far as the ingredients they don't use any fillers or any solve in some it's the ethanol extracted cannabis oil in Turkey you can just get the cartridge by itself but I purchased a starter kit and the reason why is with the starter kit you get this nifty little battery here alright you can see the USB charge it also has the screw in for the cartridge then this right here would be the LED screen I told you how much percentage your battery is tells you what your amperage is has a ten-second lockout and even has a counter for you from when you've taken a pool you can get an aqua micro dose it looks like put together as you can see is very compact slim sleek I really love the design this is how you turn it on it's five klicks to turn it on oh this is your adjustable arrows you know up down so go ahead and get this started for you guys see here one two oh I already had it on as you can see I'm sitting at 98% 97 oh I love top you get hit with this like kind of sweet taste then it goes into like this earthy piney trying to do then it goes into of like a flower or soapy type deal of um it's not bad let me try this again yeah same thing yeah definitely hit you with the sweet in the beginning then it goes into like this piney earthy taste didn't hit you like this flower like lavender soap type deal from I'm describing that would probably be like the hell is this but actually is not bad you don't think bait reviews we have a point system see where this cartridge ranks on dang great reviews we judge out for three categories which are taste potency in value or the max amount of points for each category is five and then a lot of points to be adding rape is tuned and then maximum amount of points to be adding rape is 15 so let's see where Mary's dissolutes fits on 10 great reviews so first up is taste for taste I'm gonna give it a 5 the taste is not gonna be for everybody just because I'm a goes from a sweet to look like a piney earthy kind of taste then to finish it off with like a lavender flower so P type deal like I said what I'm describing normally would be like what the hell is this but actually I'm like impressed so for taste 5 next up is potency for pouncing I'm gonna give it a 5 this cartridge is tested between eighty eighty five percent THC it definitely grabs you addition to where you need to go quick fast in the hurry and I mean it's a THC blend so for potency 5 I last but not least value for value I'm gonna give it a four depending on where you get the cartridge from can run you fifty bucks I guess um if obviously if you get the StarTAC it's gonna run you a little bit more um but hey what you get in return I think it's a fair trade or I'm the battery like I said suggestible it helps with micro Dossey you know the percentage you could do the paradise now some add up our scores for taste we have five for posse we have five and for value we have four so that brings us courts of 14 it's a dank vape you know I'm not going to tell you to run out and you know go have it you know just having some fun I'm however if you're familiar with Mary's medicinal zone I would say go get the cartridge if you haven't tried it on the stage true just with all the rest of their products um it works is it effective and it's potent so yeah I would definitely uh you know check it out if you ever come across it so before in this video real quick see I picked up some new subscribers so uh thank you welcome to the channel to everybody who's been reaching out to me I definitely will be getting back to you I've been very very busy all of a sudden I know a little bit behind on this review I apologize for that I've actually been working on a couple other projects that aren't cannabis related aren't even YouTube related so you know there's been doing other things and um to everyone appreciate the support I'm gonna keep doing these reviews and until next time keep baking in vaping y'all", "lkdIfY_gm3Y": "what's up Barry by shouldwe mastermind here aka Han theme Ohio cannabis live we're back with another video make sure you like subscribe and watch the end for a chance to win a free grinder what's up I should play mastered my aka Anthony here for hop cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're gonna be talking about a new product it has just come to the market I've been waiting all day to show you guys I haven't even opened it it's still staple in the bag isn't that something so we're doing a review from the bag okay this came from Burton creations in Columbus shout out to them and today we're gonna be talking about live resin syringes so a lot of people are familiar with these syringe products so I'm gonna read the information here but I'm gonna talk about why this is different from the ones you've already been buying in the program first of all let's go over the testing information here again this is a standard wellness product this is a live resin where is the other cartridges or the other surrenders you've been getting are just THC oil so the numbers here the testing here the TC is 550 milligrams and the CBD here's my favorite part is a hundred and twenty-five milligrams this is a distillate and this this particular product was created using a butane extraction process a lot of other dishes are created using a co2 extraction process a lot a lot of different people have different emotions about co2 extraction versus butane extraction so just so you understand and I'll put some more information on my website and everywhere else on the Ohio cannabis live page about these different extraction methods is that some extraction methods are better suited for some products than others so when it comes to making live resin part of the process involves you taking the cannabis and putting it into a freezer first and you do this to protect the plant from degrading typically when you take cannabis and you cure it in a normal method whether you cure it in a mason jar or you hang it up in a room let it dry and cure that way or in a barrel like some places do that is degrading the plant almost immediately so when you do live resin frozen live resin you freeze it first and then you put it into a butane extraction system - you couldn't use a co2 extraction simply because it just wouldn't work the the cannabis and the TCS and everything and terpenes everything with degrade faster so typically when dealing with live frozen resin it has to be a handle in a certainly different way than it would be if you were just making a co2 based distillate so a lot of people have concerns about butane extraction even myself I've had some concerns I have that opportunity to tour standard wellness and I have actually seen their butane extraction machine and I can tell you that it has a lot of safety measures involved with it utan extraction process also a lot of safety and it's you know it's relatively you know controlled environment that these things are done in and then there's also some testing and stuff done to make sure that the product is still safe so I can personally say that all the products that I've tried from all these growers including standard I feel that they're safe I haven't had any adverse actions person that doesn't mean that it can't happen to anybody so I'll just get that out there let's get that out of the way but you know with this syringe being in live resin like I say it's gonna be different than what you would be getting in a regular THC to still a syringe which as many of you who have been buying these since the program started obviously because you get more volume in the syringe than in the pen the pen is mostly half a round tins and with the syringe here we're getting a little bit close to a gram we're not we're not actually all the way to a gram we're at point zero we're 0.84 of a gram here so pretty close but we're not quite there yet part of the reason we're not getting to the grams because whenever they try to do a full gram it ends up being a higher potency and then what tends to happen is the state makes them take it instead of it being a one-day product that makes the product end up being a two-day product so I know many of you have wondered why these products are not coming to the fulgrim where every time they try to go fulgrim ends up being too strong for the states policy limit which you know it varies depending on what product it is there's a different potency limit for edibles there's different pulses little flower and there's different polti limit for these these concentrates and that usually caps around 69 70 % I do believe I could be wrong don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure it's pretty close to 7% or less that these have to be at in order for them to be able to be approved and also like I said this stuff goes do additional testing that lets say flour doesn't necessarily go through it because the way it's processed in maize so they have to test it before they make the actual solution that distill it and then test it after they make it to steal it so it's kind of like testing it multiple times to make sure that everything guy you know everything is the way it's supposed to be I don't know exactly how much that cost but my understanding is it's a lot more expensive to get the concentrates tested than it is to get flour tested just because of the way the product is so let's go ahead and open this puppy up fresh as you can see it is sealed I have not opened it I don't know what I'm gonna see in here what colors don't look like I don't know so let's do this together one two three yeah we're open all right you've all seen but for those who haven't seen to open these bags you have to get your finger in between a little place here where there's like a little thumb thingy right here I'm pointing a finger and then you get your fingers in there and pull apart it's not too bad that's not the greatest thing all right so then here is the syringe whoa hey that looks really good now that looks like some go there that looks really really good I would say this is looking really really good so what I'd like to do is tell people that and this is something standard suggested this you want to kind of warm this cartridge up a little bit I'm sorry syringe up a little bit before you actually use it what I'm gonna be doing today is I'm going to be using my packs and I'm going to be using the oven that comes with the packs in order to do this review now just like I did with the RSO syringe if you saw that video what I like to do is I like to run mine under some hot water to get it lucid so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pause the video and I'm gonna go run this under some hot water for a few seconds and then I'll be back and we'll go ahead and load it in my packs and see exactly what it tastes like now by the way I didn't mention but this is actually the strain is called headband okay just to make sure I have covered that the strain name is headband so those that didn't catch that I'm sorry I couldn't see it the glare was because of the gold on the on the pack so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and pause this and go ahead and warm this up and I'll be right back alright I'm back so still looks the same - ie I recommend roughly 30 seconds of hot water you know and that's it just you know make sure you don't make sure the cap is still on it before you do it obviously you don't get water and your distill it that would be bad all right so I'm gonna go ahead and twist this off see it came off real easy you can see the fluid here now Ivan is empty okay and we're gonna go for small small amount you only need a dab folks so don't fill the oven up the oil should drop right in there and this in this oven is cold so there's no I like to do my cold so as you can see the distilling is in there and that is not a lot but that's enough for us to sample okay and then I put my I screw this back on there and it's clean all right so now you know I'm gonna go ahead and prep this up and I'm gonna go ahead and do my 30-second warm-up and like I said I think it's important to note that a lot of people do use these syringes to fill cartridges and that is something you can do and you still the process be saying you want to warm it up and then you would want to you definitely want to get one of those needles that didn't come with it little needle but there's a little new you can screw on the top of there to make it easier to get the oil into the syringe I mean into the cartridge I'm sorry and I think that that's something they might have to look at adding maybe a plastic one or something like that that will kind of make the refilling cartridge process easier but for me it's fine without it so now I'm a green light I'm going to go ahead and give it a taste hitman huh whoa yeah yeah let's do it water let's do doing the water folks is getting us get a water test going cuz this stuff's and tasting all right still in that same little bit the those guys are standard they doesn't did it again this is very smooth yeah I would say how am I feeling right now okay well when I sat down into this video I was in a lot of pain so I'm trying to assess how this is helping me for pain because that's what I got it for because I'm having pain where am I having pain that right now I'm having pain in my stomach where I had my hernia surgery and so I'm looking for relief for that specific issue at this point I'm not paying other funds to the disaster that is where I'm mainly having pain and I needed some relief so I'm going to pause this video for a second just to give it time to set in and then I'm gonna come right back and tell you how I'm feeling I'll be right back all right I'm back so it's been about 15 minutes or so and that lasted a lot longer than I thought let me check the oven here and see what's left it I hope she's my - ticked off my oven cuz could still be kind of hard you can see it's still smoking and well lo and behold look at that there is essentially nothing in there and kind of get a good angle and so it almost burned it completely clean I mean they say it was definitely a small dose but what can I tell you I tasted terpenes I'm not an expert on terpene so I can't tell you what terpenes I taste it but you know I think that that's something that we're gonna get you know some feedback on is that when they make these kind of products it will probably be a good idea to maybe get the terpenes either on the front kind of like what they do with another another cultivator or even to get the terpenes on the back so I think that that's certainly worth doing but really overall I'm feeling a little bit of relief I mean sometimes takes a little while for stuff to kick in but as far as my body and my mind I'm feeling relief from anxiety and stress and you know I'm definitely seeing some positive medicinal effects from this so I would say that this is a good product it tastes great it has a smooth taste if you saw my video I didn't call for choke at all and I took pretty good topes on that even after I pause the video and I continue to keep taking toks I still didn't have any really harsh hits my throat didn't burn so what I would say is the product is smooth smooth on the throat smooth on the lungs I did faith fit through packs with the convection heat so I can't really give a fair assessment a little be like in a pen with the coil heater but it's still similar is still heating oil vaporizing but in this situation like I said but packs it gradually heats the product and then you vaporize it verses with a pen it's pretty much one to man heat you know so it's like now so I think that that makes a difference you know if I hit a pin it sometimes can be a little harsh on my throat whereas if I hit the packs I can control the temperature a little bit more and I can turn the temperature down so I think that makes it useful so with that I'm gonna go ahead and wrap the video and say I think if you get you some had been live resin because it is different from the THC syringe you got before it's definitely gonna be tasty it's gonna be a little bit stronger and I think you're gonna feel the effects a little bit sooner than other products but again I think that you should definitely give it a try and should Boyd mastermind okay Anthony on how cameras live sign up see you next time 8 well

guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind", "K2-iRt-P6f4": "what is out so today we are smoking on some skittles skittles thank you to my lovely fiancee um she's is this to what do you use it for baby she got this for when I have panic attacks okay so she uses it for anxiety I am trying it for the first time so I will let you know how it hits me initially and after the second hit I would do the same I have a bomb here the dab star that is a little dirty and I would love to do a hand out of this thing because it cools down the hit dramatically but the problem is you lose all the [ __ ] taste because it's a little dirty so we're gonna hit it out of this twice it is set to 7 watts as you can see 7 6 or 7 watts is the ideal temperature for if you have one of these things or if you have one of these things you know this is this is also set it said that once you know it's I use because I smoke nicotine as well I find these batteries very useful I used to smoke cigarettes but but anyway cannabis let's let's talk about that we have skittles here this is an indie be dominant mix of grape 8th and grapefruit which I mean I know I'm reading that right here and that's care about that but indica dominant is really for me a big a big plus because I do have anxiety attack this might go to Frank's iid do indica because they're generally my go-to for anxiety I did the chem diesel that I reviewed in my in one of my last reviews that was sativa dominant but it gave you indica of facts but still gave you the sativa energy so it was kind of weird but I loved it it was great but what we're gonna do for those of you who don't know is we're gonna hit this twice when we have flour we hit the flour twice when we have dabs we take two dabs we always do it twice that's what we're gonna do and we're gonna hit this once we're gonna let you to the flavor we're gonna cost a little bit because I can't I can't knock off you know and then we're going to review the taste and the sensations you know the high of it the any negative effects maybe if you're looking for if you're looking for it to do one thing and it does another we'll go over that all that fun stuff so here we go guys let's turn this right it's my favorite thing it's my favorite part right here just like look at that isn't that so cool it's very cool alright so here we go skills Wow okay you know how when you're eating skittles and you just dump four minutes in 20 seconds haha and you just dump a whole bunch of colors in your hand and you pop them in your mouth that's that's what that tastes like that is who that is a concoction of very fruity flavors the hi are the initial onset when you exhale you feel very one feels very relaxed I feel very relaxed um and it's a very euphoric very giddy kind of relaxation almost it makes you want to sit there and just kind of tell jokes to one another you know what I'm saying it's Thanksgiving here so it would be the perfect time to do it but I keep forgetting how late it is honestly so and that's another thing about it it it really helps with it would probably probably be good for pain I can't say it to probably put no Meah alright guys so upon yeah I know okay upon the first hit I am because I am roasty-toasty um feeling good feeling nice it's it's a functional kind of hi I have a feeling that the the hi is pretty it's a pretty potent hi so I have a feeling after two hits I will no longer be functional or I might but some people probably wouldn't be because this is this is like 99% THC in this little [ __ ] in this little [ __ ] thing not this just this this this is this is the whole thing right here just for those of you who don't know I will comment below and let me know what you want to see more of if you want to see more reviews like if you want to see more flower or more concentrate if you want to see more of my fiance or you know just dabs or flower or you know if you want me to go over the devices I'm smoking yeah so here comes the second hit it's gonna be intense I know it is because that first one was pretty intense but all right guys ten-second inhale you'll see what I exhale yeah tastes very much the same but now now I I know that taste is gonna be on my tongue for like the next hour I'm just very flavorful very potent very awesome it's uh it's very good for anxiety and when I say good for anxiety I mean like when you take a Tylenol it doesn't go to the center of your pain basically it goes to your brain tricks their pain receptor to thinking about something else and that's what this we've strayed does you start thinking about other things that are more important than the pain or the anxiety or what have you and it does alleviate some of the physical pain as well both of my elbows were [ __ ] killing me today because I'm beginning to Train 1-iron chin-ups and those those are pretty brutal on your elbow tendons and this is definitely this has definitely helped my elbows as far as anxiety goes I'm feeling very relaxed as far as depression goes I'm feeling very happy yeah I would say skittles as far as the high goes and this one I know hi I can never say that right the first time initial onset hi very very potent I would give it a night at his head so two of those two of those hits are [ __ ] you only really need one but flavor ten out of ten definitely you know it's there there's these are empty but they're just little cases with this deliver so it's completely portable as long as you have a battery you know almost odorless very very convenient so if you want to very discreetly smoke your cannabis medicate maybe not off this huge [ __ ] thing but you know out of this I have a battery but they have they have much much smaller batteries that are much more discreet that are just little boxes like little squares summer just pen some are just pens you know yeah so comment below let me know what you want to see if you want to see anything and you know if you liked what you see subscribe because I'm gonna be doing more of these", "2Ud1G3fDiE4": "[Music] what's going on youtube it's your boy turpy time welcome back

cartridges but before we do that let's look at the numbers right i have not even looked at the numbers so you guys are seeing the numbers before i do i don't know what it looks like my camera is super dirty but it's not lit i just wiped it the [ __ ] off let me try again better [ __ ] name tag always remember to rip your name tags off guys if you're gonna do reviews like what i do all right there we go there's numbers you guys can see it all right i'm going to take andrew these numbers here real quick this isn't this little cartridge which i really don't care for but you know it is what it is

mint kush all right let's get it let's go here we go please not big head space i know your [ __ ] whatever here we go here we go with that space oh yeah at least the headspace is about the same every [ __ ] time i guess huh all right all right not going to dilly dally in this one boys kind of tastes like christmas candy like uh peppermint kinda maybe that's the mint i don't know all right the lowest voltage which is at 3.3 one two three four five cheers here we go minty you can definitely taste the men in this one can't taste the kush like i said it reminds me of like a christmas peppermint is what this is reminding me of um it is a distillate cartridge i i thought i would be more excited about it but i'm not too excited about it bro i'm not i'm i don't know man i'm just not i don't know that meant that mint mint taste uh [Music] i don't know i just i'm not a big fan of it if if that's what you say it is good i'm not i'm not knocking it i just um i still have that taste in my mouth and i'm not a real fan of it i mean if you like mince i guess kind of like a peppermint i guess it it even kind of smells like a a mint uh i mean it's good [ __ ] it let's go in hot i'm gonna turn it all the way up it's going hot at 3.8 or what is it 4.4.8 and uh let's let's see what's up let's see what it tastes like on a hot hot hit cheers too hot now that just tastes like a burnt mint distillate and done going hot too hot let's try 4.3 and then i'm in this video nothing expands in lungs i don't know i'm just not really a disliked fan a dislike cart fan and this is what i think 50 bucks at maryland health and wellness center i would much rather pay the [ __ ] the extra 15 dollars get the liquid live resin cartridges but the [ __ ] up thing is like i said an earlier video homeboy down the street can get two of these for what the [ __ ] i pay for which it's sad it truly is it's sad all right let's go in at 4.3 about in between about the middle heat and let's see what happens let's see if i could taste the difference or anything and i am getting the buzz off of it don't don't get me wrong it is good medicine and the color that oil is [ __ ] always fire grass roots color their oil is always fire no matter what the oil always looks that that same color the same consistency cheers that's more like it not bad not bad i definitely like the concentrate better but uh yeah if you like mint stuff then go go try this mint kush from grassroots if you don't like mint stuff then uh stay away from it i got a little sweat off that is either that or miranda's hoodie is a little warm in my room here but uh anyway yeah smash that like share subscribe grassroots y'all this is [ __ ] like always cresco while you know y'all good y'all know the [ __ ] deal anyway i am buzzed so it's not a bad cartridge peace out boys [Music]", "rFboZt75oCc": "what's up guys ninjagos here we're going to fill up the uh the 1 mil syringe with the delta 8 this look got it in the in the uh here you fill it up to about your they'll take this to the line now you're gonna want to run this two cycles so you're gonna want to heat it up once get it moving good put it back in the microwave get it boiling again not with this in it just the water get the water boiling again put it back in there let it sit there for a couple minutes and you should be ready to fill now if you're worried about um terpenes burning off and cannabinoid loss and stuff like that then you'll probably have to do uh do it a little more professional and get you a heat plate with the magnetic stirrer but this is about the only way i know to do it and i've done it before so do all the in the water i'm gonna heat this up stick it on gonna pull up real slow do there you go feel the syringe pop this off or screw it off and then you get your one field just push it out let me see if i get it focused there we go just push it out you know you have to reheat it back up to push it out of course but push it back out and get it to a full even ground or whatever you want see if it's still hot enough to fill this no see you've lost your heat as you see this one won't feel because you've lost your heat it's clogged up so that's the trouble everybody's having right but it will work if you get it hot enough and you pull it slow enough that's how you do it but you said anything other than that if you're uh worried about it being too hot you're losing uh terpenes you're losing uh cannabinoids things that nature and you don't want that to happen then of course you'll have to do some uh upgrading right get you the the tools that the professionals use to put the stuff in there professionally but uh other than that guys that's about it delta a dislike being put into the syringe i mean i know it's not the most professional way of doing it but i guess if you have all the professional stuff to do it with and you wouldn't even know how to feel one right so anyways guys that's uh that's all i got i wanted to get that video out for a few of the people that watch and uh wanted to know it was a question that was asked a couple of times so try to get it out to you guys and uh hopefully i got some more videos coming soon so uh hit the like subscribe if you uh like the the video if uh you like the content give me a like give me a shout out in the comments let me know what you want to see next and uh i appreciate the delta 8 community they'll take this there's good things for me so i appreciate anybody out there making videos about them you know as long as it's a good quality stuff but uh until

don't let the lemony and citrus taste fool you this high potency thc extract is pure and ta true cannabis taste riff and then i'm reading all this off of the disposable webs the review for the same

review you guys so we're uh gonna tap into this john g and super lemon haze cart right now i'll see on the other side of the urban scale intro when i pop this card out and we take a look y'all cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys another unique looking approach at these cartridges ooh that is very different so pull that out ooh really small hole for the inhalation there but it's a pretty hefty cartridge it's got the rift logo right on the bottom it's got the john gee and super lemon haze wrap around there and you know what you guys know before we even get going we are taking that thc sticker off of this cart come on there you go that's off of there and we're gonna add it to the collection right here i'll see you guys oh this one's gonna stick nice and quick i was gonna say i'll see you guys after i'm done getting this on here but it's already on there so we're at the lowest temperature on this vape let's uh try it out and see how this john g and super lemon haze cross from riff actually turns out you guys i'm uh quite excited to see how it's gonna do i'll see you guys over there i don't know why i'm saying i'll see you guys over there we're gonna start out at the lowest temp we're gonna work way up to the highest let's see how it does starting with the lowest chisholm [Music] so this is actually a metal tip i don't mind that draws isn't my biggest fan for this cart to draw but it does have a decent enough flavor that i'm really interested and excited to keep going on this you guys so let's uh try it out the medium temp and see if the draw is any better and see if it changes the flavor at all because that was a really nice and light citrus kind of flavor i was getting at that time of trip you guys cheers still really sweet really decent flavor draw again biggest downside and then i'm curious to see if it's going to make a difference between the g pen and the fire side just because of how small the intake holes are going to be and the g pens are substantially larger you guys can see there like you compare the two it is night day you can't even tell the difference with the camera on here they're that small so i've got it bumped up to the highest temperature still got that really nice sweet almost more of a lemon push with this one i'm enjoying this cart so far i'm starting to feel the effects too which is surprising i don't usually get it this early in the review but uh i'm enjoying it so far you guys so let's try it out the highest temp on this fireside before we switch on over start pulling it from the g pen cheers [Music] first thought when this went on the g pen was damn that looks sharp with the whole black g pen battery but all i've got is a blue and i don't mind that i like this blue quite a bit my last hoot was still really smooth really lemon rich flavor overall just enjoyable to smoke you guys and i i had quite a good flavor coming off of it and it did really really well but now we've got it moved over to the g pen i had the same draw issues with that battery at the highest temp as it did with the lowest so i'm hoping that the bigger ports on this g pen is going to allow for smoother pull and potentially some bigger clouds you guys but the only way we're going to find that out is by actually finding out we've got it set on the lowest temp of this g-pad let's see how fruity and flavorful this is going to be through the three taps you guys cheers definitely an easier lighter pull it allowed the um the flavors to definitely be more explosive in my mouth i've definitely got a really rich almost like a lemon jolly rancher not jolly ranchers um starburst that's that's really what i'm tasting here and i'm enjoying it quite a bit is that lemon starburst flavor and i was not expecting this sweet and rich of a flavor to come from this cart you guys so now that we've got it set on the second temperature let's see how it does there before we move on to the highest cheers i forgot to score the five side battery guys we're gonna give it an 8 out of 10. there we go it was enjoyable but the difficulty to pull through those ports key reason why i'm knocking it down two points but this g-pan there ain't no issue pulling from the ports it's it feels just like a regular vape cartridge does no different on the jeep than any of the other ones i've had but it's significantly different than the fireside battery and i haven't noticed any other cartridges giving me that big of a of an airflow issue through the fireside just just this one that we're trying right now you guys which is curious that uh it's the only one to have that issue right now or that noticeable of an issue but we're gonna move on to the highest temperature really easy to pull from really fruity and flavorful for um just enjoy it is a really mouth pleasure really enjoyable vaporizer to smoke you guys so we're gonna go ahead and try it out at the highest temp before we start ripping through some glass you guys i'm looking forward to seeing how it tastes um on this highest temp and i'm also really excited to see how it's going to do through the rigs because that always changes things up a little bit but let's try it out cheers okay biggest thing i'm going to mention not that harsh through the nerve through the nose doesn't burn quite as much as some of the other carts which is actually really surprising we've got it switched on over to the fireside battery again come on let's get you switched on over there we got it set up on the fireside battery at the lowest temperature again we go through our mad hatter rig here we are man we are all mad here absolutely 100 true and uh we run it through the three temperatures again to see what type of flavors we experience through the uh additional water filtration that comes with the rigs we've got our hemper adapter on there we're gonna put that in there and that's how we're gonna do it we preheat the last rip so that uh it's as fast as we can get it but for now let's uh try out the lowest tap and work our way up there i'll see you guys after these three reps when we have a chat about uh the glass but before we do that i'm gonna give the g pen a nine out of a ten the flavor was really good it had a nice strong explosive flavor in the end i just wished it was that strong all the way through and i'd give it the ten it's enjoyable but it wasn't exciting and that's where those tens are gonna come from so let's see if it's exciting to glass you guys but uh let's get smoking see you guys after these three hits cheers [Music] [Music] uh okay guys so that uh a pen did rip quite well through the rig it really didn't have an overly explosive flavor until we got to the second earth and third ribs and then you definitely got more of that lemon flavor the last one was where it was the strongest with that almost starburst like flavor and i i did enjoy it quite a bit um definitely it's something i'd be interested and curious in combining it with a really sweet citrusy strain to try and get that overwhelming overwhelming combo i think i've got some orange cookies left from gage and that might be might be how i celebrate any anything bigger just why not but uh yeah we've got the g pen ready to go you guys we got it on the lowest temp time to do three more rips and preheat the last one because why the [ __ ] not but uh yeah i'll see you guys after these three rips when we give the glass a score and then we wrap it up with the high and the overall but for the time medium cheers see you after these three rips uh okay guys i'm gonna give it a 10 out of a 10 for the taste from a glass it really that the last the g pen took it away it honestly reminds me of my favorite candy it's a hot like it's a hard candy it's the uh um lemon drop i absolutely love these lemon drop candies they're or not lemon drop [ __ ] i'm thinking of a plant you guys can that's the high the high is going to do incredibly well um not a lemon drop a sherbet lemon candy they're really really good hard candies i absolutely love them i would oh if i could have a bag of those i physically have to move them away from me because i'll just eat one after the other after the other after the other after the other i love that sweet and citrus blend absolutely favorite candies so i'm going to give it a 10 out of a 10 for the high as well without a doubt um this is one of the best hitting cartridges i have smoked yet just because it's got that combination of that jonky and the super lemon hey so that john gee i'm feeling is that really heavy mental drift that's kind of that's making me stutter up and make some mistakes but still it's really enjoyable and quite heavy on the effects but i can feel that super lemon haze it's like okay let's get up let's do something let's enjoy it so it's a very good out and about cartridge because you can smoke it and then oh let's go do something ooh let's go do this ooh let's go do that and while you're there you're really just enjoying it you've got that mental drift in there it overall it's really really great cartridge for during the day and i'm quite impressed with how heavy the effects are hitting and how much of a body uplift that i'm feeling with this riff um cartridge so it did it did incredibly incredibly well and with a 37 out of 40 only dropping three points on the entire review that's not bad um the fireside vape the biggest downside it had i honestly had from it was the size of the ports and that's more the battery than the cartridge however most other cartridges didn't have an issue with that so i've got to dock some points on that because the restricted airflow does make it a little bit harder to enjoy because you're hauling harder moving to the g pen it had that flavor but it didn't have the the the sherbet lemon the lemon heads whatever you want to call them but those really good candies lemon candies um they it just didn't have that pull with the vaporizer by itself but when you threw it on a rig it absolutely had it was 100 way more enjoyable and i'm really looking forward to combining it with a very citrusy tasting strain and uh enjoying it that way but for now i'm going to take one more haul off of this and then we're going to wrap this video up after uh you see the clouds you'll see my end card slide

best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you

morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on these but I would appreciate it and I'm also gonna do a giveaway because they gave me two of them so I'm not gonna use the other one so I'm gonna give it away I will personally share to you guys his doorstep I'm sending out to UPS wherever you guys are at so you guys let me know and guys she got something loaded already I'm glad and hit it again she'd like to take a blinker man [ __ ] it never tried to blink on these [ __ ] arm pen cards which is only like on Stevie or like a plug-and-play but we're going to try it blink on this [ __ ] I'm already loaded this card you just smacked guys if you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I don't know it's it's weird but yeah that's just like a MX for like a little short you know we're for maxi but really appreciate you guys watching my

help the channel out a lot you know bring out better content for you guys and also would really appreciate that as well so you guys have a really blessed day and these guys", "2quA9B22k4M": "welcome to community cannabis review so originally my strategy with videos was to basically make one video per brand essentially didn't even really get into multiple videos per strains um mostly just to show you that so you got a brand you searched it up on youtube or you saw it at the dyspo before you bought it search it up on youtube and just verify that they don't make some crap or they're not basically gonna scam you for some booty that you don't want um but i've been having a lot a lot of people say that they want more videos more often and i kind of want to make some more honestly more frequently than i do so i'm going to start making a video basically every time i get a cart or a concentrate if i can or as frequently as i can to that anyways so um i'm not doing the editing on this one i'm gonna re-download my editing software and stuff but for this one i don't feel like it needs it too much because there's not very much packaging to even go over let's start with the hush brand cartridge because i was really surprised with the last one that i got so i picked up another one so um i got this one at beaver bulls where are we at let's see if i can get it to focus there we go phone's actually focusing uh purple cali cush cannabis extract cartridge try that again um this is one gram container uh contains rather 77 points 77 percent thc there we go 77 point actually the 770 milligrams dhc excuse me i can't talk today um then the cbd is 22 milligrams total i believe that puts it at 0.22 percent i don't remember how to work that i'm not thinking clearly um you got all your production info on there and then compliance labels and stuff but other than that it doesn't come with much it's very bare bones for a cart um you got the price there before tax which this dyspo does a lot do before attacks some do after etc anyways and here's the cartridge itself you can see that's some really nice looking distillate which this looks hard to screw up but at the lower um lower price points you will find just like i assume it's made from trim that's even worse off so it just requires more starting material allowing more contaminants in total like chlorophyll and just well everything that's not desirable and you know with distillation i don't know that it matters maybe it's just they got better with their process don't know what the situation is all i know is in my opinion they got better here's the you got um got two silicone caps and then you got the compliance label which i always tear off or peel off whatever and this little weed sticker got these like everywhere all right let's see if i can get some better pictures of this i got a sun lamp right now which is doing nothing but making my eyes look gorgeous nothing for the weed though um let's do some different colors put it in front of super clean um super clear what got me into this was i actually got a cart a couple days ago and it was even better than this one i don't remember the strain i think it was like um maui papaya or something like that um all right well i'm throwing everything i can't speak or grab anything right now apparently um that's the one that i was talking about same same deal basically but yeah i tried them out and they were readily better than i remember them so i wanted to make a video plus i just want to get into making some anyways so let's see if i can't taste some terpenes on this the other one was very interesting terpene wise that's also something i was grateful for they normally have some basic ass servings but this last one they had um i definitely tasted some one of the more exotic terpenes i'll say i don't remember what it was though the consistency is really nice on this dude's gotten a little better i'm using a mirror behind my phone so that i can point it straight at me so bear with me as i look that way and i hit super nice these are up there now with like what i call gold standard distillate cards because like i said distill it's hard to [ __ ] up so once you get to a certain point it doesn't really get any better it's just like as good as it gets and that's really not hard to achieve either but somehow people occasionally mess it up but you got like buddies and select those cards are just distill it how it's supposed to be done hush is getting up there they're pretty dang close now other than the fact that buddies and select have better hardware i want to say it's very close for this one sadly the terpenes i'm only really getting some pretty heavy mirror scene it tastes like a lot of purple strains for sure which that might be something different yeah these cards are solid um i just wanted to get another video out because i want to start putting out more so i hope you enjoyed this like and subscribe and stay tuned and i'll put out more and ideally better ones soon thanks for watching", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "cVoQG7IDVD0": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films and I'm excited to be back at you with another legal cartridge review here in Illinois as you can see this is a Lemon Drop disposable point three Gramm yes point three gram cartridge I didn't know they made them that small but you know it's a nice little disposable cart the first disposable I've tried here in Illinois and you can see it's in the matter line of products by far McCann which is a cultivator here in Illinois now in this instance I believe Lemon Drop is not a strain specific flavor but instead it's a kind of laboratory infused combination of terpenes for a sort of confectionery flavor I would say that flavor is definitely achieved it's got a delicious almost like that lemon head candy if you've ever tried those tastes just like that to me kind of a harsh hit but I really enjoy the high from it it very much that put me in a cerebral headspace where I was like really productive for at least felt like being productive and didn't want to sit still very sativa dominant in terms of the high for me but yeah great taste like I said a little bit of a harsh hit but I do like the disposable convenience and as you can see in this video here no external battery or charging required you just draw and you get a nice hit out of it and this stuff is good medicine now let's talk about price so pretty much the standard recreational price I'm seeing after-tax there's a little bit of give or take to this depending on where you're located in Illinois but pretty much to give in to price after-tax for these point three gram disposable carts is about 50 bucks which is an unbelievably horrible deal I can get full Graham carts for considerably cheaper that are just top-shelf quality from the black market which is the case for most people I know but nevertheless why I'm here is to document this legal cannabis situation here in Illinois and it's gonna continue to progress hopefully and hopefully prices will be less [ __ ] but hopefully this painted a good picture if you're interested in picking up this cart I would recommend it for it's great lemon confectionery flavor and its really awesome sativa dominant productivity inducing buzz that's all I got to say today though guys stay safe", "Bq2J1yIaXBU": "so lately I've been really into these um THC C cell cartridges and there's been a lot of stuff on the news saying that a lot of people are breeding these things in getting permanent lung damage from these bootleg bunk carts you know so I'm here to kind of show you what a bootleg cart does look like these cards fit 8510 battery you know you guys are big bite and you're in your seaso palms that's a distillate right there when I got in there anyways these ones right here I've all bought in from the club's seasons I got black market these black market ones you see I open one up I tried a couple puffs off it didn't have any effect at all you can see you I'll show you Brendan this hood right here you see all the markings on it I've tested no pesticides but what's funny is this company doesn't even make these things anymore they went out of business for being you know testing too high in pesticides and and all sorts of stuff so they don't even make these anymore I'm hearing and only people that are making these are filling them up with fake distillates or whatever and making people real real sick because these are the ones my god they totally fake the strawberry cop hybrid that's a sativa it's not a hybrid it's more strong see so I thought oh it's California tested you know California that's some [ __ ] dude um the only way to really make sure you're not getting bunk carts like this is to just go to a dispensary and buy them and and even even then it's still kind of a fee like let's say look I got these buddy's brands that I've been smoking all these things are pretty good yeah you can see that they've been you know even with those markings right there you wouldn't even be able to trust it you know but uh it's but hey it's on there look there's the percent look here's a navy x1 this one co2 but you can see right there I've tested this one right here I got for all the cheap right there the dispensary here locally and kind of iffy what you can see has the real testing on it and whatnot these ones on the other hand they don't they have the steel you think it'd be real but you can get them on you know th Gator I like expressing and get these and fill them up with whatever you really want and people would think you know did you go to the clubs and you think the packaging is sick looks like one of those high-end ones look it's even got thick thick oil in there but bogus is [ __ ] did I never seems kind of expensive you're like Oh for the price of one of these I can pick up a [ __ ] grip of these but it's any worth it dude any worth getting sick dude you know just pay the money for it whatever you know you have a good hook up and good for you but you know just stick to these or get yourself a Carta just quit [ __ ] with the distillates altogether but you know I like my [ __ ] on the go too so it's whatever dude she so don't smoke this [ __ ] let me better look so you could see what they look like you know here's a bogus one not open here the one that I did open I kind of [ __ ] you fake-ass a brass knuckle thread I actually took out some of the juice out of this one we kind of like look at it and [ __ ] everybody has some it's all the carpets just [ __ ] way somebody filling the trash yeah dude someone's out there hustling this shit's crazy can't believe it it's kind of funny having one it's like a little novelty these fake-ass cards you know anyways alright guys well it smell good", "DmI1HIfQqUo": "what's going on guys it's your boy the Loki legend how the [ __ ] y'all doing today I'm doing alright I got a brand new episode of STONER tips here for you guys it's gonna be episode 23 and we're gonna be talking about dab cartridges versus regular wax and what the difference is and if you should invest in a gram of wax or if you should invest in a dab cartridge so just jump on into it obviously if you're going to get regular wax you know there's you know you're gonna need it hopefully you wouldn't have a rig to smoke this out of and you know an actual little setup a dab rig you know blowtorch when you're picking up regular wax I feel like you need to have you know a good kit on you a good little stoner a little setup that you're gonna be able to smoke this wax efficiently off of and not waste any of it rather than trying to smoke this on maybe a bowl with some weed or something so in it all depends on how you're smoked in it yes it if you can pick up the same amount of wax you know a grandma wax or a cartridge for the same price I have a nice little setup and if you guys don't have a setup then maybe I would recommend actually buying the dab cartridge because all you need for the dab cartridge setup is you can go to a tobacco store or a vape store and ask them for one of the disposable batteries or rechargeable batteries and I think they're about ten dollars the one I bought was ten dollars it did not have a button so it kind of just worked like a jewel where you kind of just hit it and it recognized when you were hitting it and it would heat up the dab cartridge so in that a sense I did spend an extra $10 on the kit so you know it's it's a lot cheaper to do that than it would be to go out and buy a rig a blow torch and a banger or a nail to smoke your wax off of but in the long run it all depends on what your personal preference is and you could still take some pretty fairly fat dabs from a dab pen so it's not like you're really missing out on too much if you were to just pick up the dab cartridge rather than pick up regular wax regular wax there was a lot more fun to dab there's a lot you know different more methods to dab depending on whatever nail or bang are you using a lot of different temperatures and a lot of different flavors overall but I can't complain about the dab cartridges either because they are very they get you ice bucket very discreet and they're portable you could bring them wherever you want which is the the main key I feel like dab cartridges the main purpose of dab cartridges is because it's just so retina ly available like if you have that on you you can get high pretty much wherever you are at whatever time of the day you want and that's you know you can't really do that with regular wax you kind of just gotta be in a you know a safe environment and you know get that vibe going so it all depends on what your guys's personal preference really is if you know you'd travel a lot and [ __ ] or you're on a sports team or something maybe a dab cartridge would be your best investment rather than picking up regular wax but you know if you're not really doing too much [ __ ] you're just cooling at the crib regular wax probably might be a little better than they have cartridges but let me know in the comments section which you guys personally think I'll drop a like on this video if you did enjoy subscribe to the YouTube channel if you guys are news is up so 23s stoner tips i'm gonna drop a new stoner tips tomorrow probably episode 24 so check the channel follow me on Instagram if you guys are new I'm gonna catch you guys tomorrow though for a brand new video so y'all stay safe stay savage stay low-key it's about a Loki legend and I'm out of here adios", "bXJfXSECsZ4": "[Music] as mad at ruff house studios and welcome to my review of the steezy premium concentrated vaporizer cartridges and pens before we get started with the review I would like to thank the guys at steezy for sending out the cartridges that we're using today and setting up this review if you'd like to learn where to purchase them or to learn more about them please check out Steve's e-comm or find them on weed Maps now let's get started here's the unboxing of the steezy starter pen kit this is the pen that you will need if you're going to use any of the steezy cartridges inside of the box with the pen you have an owner's manual instructions warranty information you also have a USB charging cable and the steezy vaporizer unit itself and you can see we have a real simple kit there nice-looking little vaporizer unit but of course you're also going to need a cartridge that we're gonna unbox one of the indica biscotti and inside of the cartridges you will find also an owner's manual to tell you how to use it as well as the cartridge itself and you had you can say this is where the magic happens with this product here and we'll get it and talk more about the oil inside of these cartridges in just a second but first let's take a closer look at the pen and the cartridges themselves the pen is actually metal I thought it was plastic but upon inspection it's actually a nice metal pen there you've got the microUSB charging cable in the bottom and at the top you have the elements or the connectors that will connect it to the actual cartridges it's a really nice shape and design and it's very very small and stealthy it fits right in the palm of your hand and it's very light and you can see at the bottom of the carpet cartridges there's a little cap that comes off and that shows you where the connections is that'll connect it to the device you plug it into device the device flashes a couple of times blue there's also a light at the bottom on the heel of device and I'm not sure if it's intended but that cap that was on the bottom makes a perfect little dust cover to keep the land out of it and so yeah that that's pretty much it on the device list now to get to the most fun part of it at this little usage and the testing of the steezy concentrate pin first you're gonna charge it up that blue light there will be red while it's charging it once it's fully charged it turns blue you know it's fully charged and then comes the hard part and isn't making a decision we had 12 different flavors to choose from we had a for each of the indica as the hybrids and the sativas three or four of those were actually flavored as well but most of them were just strained specific and I tell you what they taste spot-on this is some of the best taste and cleanest wax I've hit it's a very very enjoyable experience the taste is smooth you can get a big hit if you inhale for a minute it does after about 10 seconds or so it will automatically cut off but believe me you'll have plenty of big enough hit for maximum head this pin is really great it's so easy to use the taste was incredible on all 12 of those different strains believe me I've tested them all and they're really amazing they're a distill it so they're out 90% THC and man you can really feel it let's go to the pros and cons oh the pros are that is so super easy to use it it's very clean of all these cartridges I had there was no leaks no breaks or any kind of problems with any of the cartridges the taste is amazing you can get big hits or you can get small hits and it's very strange specific no additives and the extract themselves cons are the battery life is a little short and the packaging on the cartridges tastes a little bit like or smells like on the issue anyway I still think it's great I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars out of 5 it's amazing so if you are in the market in California you can please check out Steve's EECOM that's st III is UI comm and you can find out where you can purchase those and you can also look them up on weed maps under brands and thank those guys for setting up

much on them or the strings available i have a link to their website down below and let's open it up and see if it's worth the vape on the front you'll find the strain logo and a mount in the cartridge not much on the side the back shows you instructions ingredients where to find them and general info along with warnings this one coming in at 85 thc left side nothing much again underneath zip on the top nada to open it up rip off the top and pull apart the cartridge comes with the rubber stopper on the top and bottom it has a really nice gold color [Music] on the lowest setting it burns like a champ the taste on the inhale is a little burnt but the aftertaste does have that hint of citrus the limoncello had me feeling good and laughing at the little things i was enjoying it as my main source of cannabis and lasted me about four days at full use is it worth a vape i'm gonna say yeah i was impressed with papa herb having never tried them before but everyone is different and i

out", "ZHJqEUTD11U": "hey how's it going i'm here to uh make a quick review for this vape cart right here called the willys reserve oro blanco distillate card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye", "-DLv-IvXmsU": "okay what's up youtube so if you're here today you're probably wondering how to transfer thc oil from one cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up for you guys i really hope youtube doesn't delete it again because i think i fixed the safety violations that it got deleted for um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching like comment subscribe i love you guys so much peace out", "xXKGA5iZFFM": "hello senior stoner fans the senior stoner back at you and today I have something I hope is pretty interesting I'm gonna do for you all I talk about it a lot but I don't do it in front of you this is the vapor slide take it apart battery the cartridge and the distiller notice that it's half-full only half-full so now I'm gonna open it but it's turning the mouthpiece whether it's white or black doesn't matter you still turn the mouthpiece counterclockwise to expose the inside of the vapor cartridge now there's no mouthpiece okay the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to heat the cartridge very carefully with a lighter I heat the top where you can see it's tip is metal I heat that and I heat the glass you want to heat the glass so your distill it becomes viscous so it starts to drip and move around inside the cartridge because as you attempt to drip the new distill it in you need to have a hot surface for it to come in contact with for this to work correctly you also want to warm up to distill it gently just a little bit in the syringe just to make it so it's easier to handle then you take the syringe and gently apply it directly onto the top of the cartridge touching the glass but pouring it in through the center you can see it filling up do you see it filling up gradually as I push the plunger down on the syringe it fills the inside of the cartridge with the distiller and this is one of my favorite strains tally OG which is gonna be mixed with what they're ready in the cartridge which is tangerine dream so I'm gonna have the best of both worlds I'm gonna have a real OG experience and then I'm gonna have the flavouring of that nice creamsicle that I tell you all about putting a little bit more on this side so it drips into that open space and also do not be afraid to retouch it with the white or again just so things go in smooth just give it a little touch on top like this so it goes in smooth now what you'll see is a completely filled cartridge you look all around it's completely filled then what you do is simply take your mouthpiece and reattach it by screwing clockwise because you're screwed counterclockwise take it off if you have any residual on the side what I like to do is take in a ready roll joint and just wipe it along the side you find that you get a really nice enhancement to whatever you're smoking by putting this strength of distill it right down the middle turn to Jimmy joint super into a Jimmy joint deluxe super and then we put our distill it back in the area belongs put our cartridge into it battery and begin to take a hit and that is how you fill a vapor slide two cartridges with your own distilling very simple easy process try to do it neatly don't leave too much junk on the cartridge if you can help it but it provides for an amazing experience just like that or the enhanced way I throwing it into a bubbler and doing it that way I hope you enjoyed this video on how to fill your own vapor slide cartridge please everybody have a great day and thanks for watching senior star", "0k8OwpS5HoU": "what's up everybody it's your boy henson this is my smoking channel today's video i'm just going to be session for you guys i'm going to be opening up a new cart this is a card i haven't smoked before on the channel but yeah it's going to be kind of like a review kind of just like a session today instead of vaping on my geek vape hsx i'm vaping on a smart novo 2. the part of me was killed when i was smart it's not one of the original color patterns i think they should have recently added this one or at least after the original ones were added someone had some [ __ ] party right i seen it coming but chose to ignore it and hopefully i hadn't had a novo 2 before this but it broke so this is my novo 2 my second lenovo second one [Music] [ __ ] that you can do but the card that i'm going to be opening you guys probably clicked on it because you seen that the card i'll be opening is a juice card it's super lemon haze by jeter juice premium cannabis oil distillate i believe it's made with live red not live resin terpenes but uh botanical terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes just because it tastes like flour i'm not 100 sure though this is what it's looking like ingredients on the back just slash thc facts little button you probably got to pop the bottom before you uh can uh slide it down though so let's tear the seal everybody it's pretty cold out here i can't even lie it's a little warmer than it's been for the past couple of days but it's still pretty freezing out here so i'm gonna try and make this pretty quick take some blinkers warm myself up this is the super lemon haze i have had this before but i haven't made a review on it or i haven't put it on the channel yeah this is gonna be the first time the super lemon haze is being reviewed on this channel on the side it says all the instead of vitamins you need all the thc you need pretty cool so what the oil looks like it's pretty dark distillate to be honest compared to their other cards pretty dark doesn't mean it's going to be bad however there's a clear oil there's a dark amber oil yellow oil it all hits pretty much the same as long as it's good oil and it's a good quality it's going to get you high i like that this card is not clogged so it's a nice brand new card i'm gonna put it on my gold ooze twist battery variable voltage [Music] because i mean the pens themselves are really good and they don't break but the chargers they give you with the pen are just like [ __ ] and they break all the time so i got three use pens that work for only one charger that works so you guys may understand the struggle but that's all we hear about we're here to see how this uh super lemon haze by jeter juice is hidden as i dry hit it and dry pull it without actually um hitting it it tastes good it tastes like a fresh fresh lemon so i'm imagining it's going to taste like its name super lemon haze should be pretty good uh the thc is coming in at around 81.25 percent so close to 81 that's not too high not too low i like to see distillate towards the higher 80s in the lower 90s so this isn't as high as i'd like to see it but still should be pretty good [Music] yeah let me take another vape real quick before i hit a blanket you better up your strips and if the cops pull you over better shut your lips for any [Music] so let's take this blanket cheers everybody if you guys got a card make sure you're taking the blinker getting medicated along with your boys better that way here we go cheers [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] little taste of flour the lung expansion's there it's a really smooth cartridge it doesn't give me the sensation to cough or anything like that but it definitely does hit [ __ ] [Music] i'm definitely gonna have to hit it again to give you guys an accurate uh taste uh an accurate rating for the taste i'm gonna have to hit it again and then for the potency i'm gonna hit it again too taking one blinker and based off what i can taste it tastes decent it doesn't taste too diesely or lemony it has a nice um subtle lemon taste with a subtle taste of flour as well so it tastes pretty good i'm gonna go ahead and take another blinker everybody [Music] cheers all i know [Laughter] [Music] it's really not bad at all it's actually pretty pleasant i'd probably give it like an eight out of ten for taste because it doesn't taste too strong but from what i can taste it tastes decent and uh pretty uh delicious but um as far as potency i'm gonna go ahead and hit it one more time and then give it a rating for potency um it is only 81 thc so it's not as high as it could be so i'm gonna have to keep that in mind with the rating as well but um just because it's not a high thc percentage doesn't mean that it shouldn't be potent though i've had carts that were only 70 something percent that felt like they were 90 something percent before never if i had like a 60 that felt like a 90 but like i've had 60s that feel like 80s before as well um it all just depends on the quality um regardless of the thc percentage sometimes the terpene profile and the entourage effect of all the other cannabinoids is what really gets you so um yeah that's something to keep in mind let's hit it one more time and i'll give you guys a rating for potency for this jeter juice um super lemon haze the original motor oil is better than ever valvoline's new formula is proven to maximize engine life tasty for potency it's not bad really it isn't since it could be a little higher i think i'll give it like an eight out of ten but um that gives this cart an overall rating for me an eight out of ten it's something i can definitely smoke on the daily um when i wake and bake or even when i'm going to sleep i can smoke sativas nowadays they don't keep me up but yeah this is my review on the cheeto juice super lemon haze i'm going to be session on this for the next couple of days so you guys might see it in the sessions overall like an 8 out of 10 really solid product as far as for a sativa cartridge it's not bad not my favorite from them i like their tangy berry a little bit better i like their strawberry cheesecake as well but if you're looking for a pickup and you see this definitely don't pass it up i definitely go for it i think it was around 35 in the dispensary for a full gram which is on the lower end of the spectrum for good quality oil but um if you guys enjoyed

is my smoking channel stay high", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "jZ6x8shCQqI": "- PO Boxes you're gonna be doing a video today for you guys I really hope you guys are doing good it is Wednesday afternoon today I'm just kicking back - I was just wondering you know what do you guys prefer you live residents really hot right now really popular now compared to distillate which distillate pretty good you know don't get me wrong it's still [ __ ] fire but a lot of people been saying you know distillate get you a little bit more higher than live resin or I don't know it just depends but they say live resins way WAY tastier than distillate but this really gets you higher than live resin so here we have a live resident Stiggy what a distillate is your regular stays you know that means hopefully you guys got a close-up on the tasty percentage so one has more CBD than the other one so that's pretty interesting as well so let me know what you guys prefer a live resin or a distillate you know pretty curious about that so we're gonna see you know to me I honestly I love both I [ __ ] with distillate a lot to me honestly I love distillate since dizzy came out it's one of my favorite distillate cartridges or applause whatever you want to call it plug and play and there's just other some other distillate cartridges are pretty fire out there but here we have a live residence tizzy this was a this was a living cookies you know I did a review on it but I haven't dropped it it's just I've been really really busy you know it means daughters coronavirus [ __ ] going on but if you guys haven't noticed live resin is way darker than actual distillate is as you guys can see this little a way lighter than what a live resin is so you know first when I seen a live resin cartridge or a pod I was like what the [ __ ] you know cuz it's way way darker so that it was like one of my first times I had try live resin so it was way darker so I was like kind of sketched about it but you know they taste really really good they taste fresh like most of life resin cartridges are really dark you know dark amber color compared to like a rocker which is really light but the but the taste on it is way way different but so today we're gonna do comparison table I'm gonna take a blink round of both of them and I'm gonna hold it in and see which one will choke me out a little better to see which one will get any high so first off we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and hit this regular distillate sativa cartridge it's a Sour Diesel as you guys can see I've gotten out of my dispensary in the fake [ __ ] you know it's good to spend extra money on the legit cartridge guys you know to make sure you guys are smoking no [ __ ] so we're gonna go ahead and take a blink out of this distillate pot and I'm going to let you guys know if it's better than the library cheers guys if you guys are smoked a lot let me go ahead and do so [Music] those who know distillates dizzy pods are always [ __ ] fired the blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play but the blinkers on the stasis are [ __ ] fire you know all you need is like maybe one blinker or two and you're good so the oil on the dizzies on the regular distillate they're really thick compared to a life resin after couple hits the live resin the library will run way way more than what a distillate when you know what I mean so if you were to flip it upside down after hit a night it will you know the oil will go upside down real quick so I'm feeling pretty high running off the distal ahead so we're gonna let him show you guys a close-up on the life resin one as you guys can see it's darker as I was saying so I suggest to see the California little sticker but they say you know don't be sketched about it you know if you guys get life rising cartridges and they're darker just because you got smoked rock garden and they're little lighter doesn't mean they're good you know but like rock garden is far but I'm just giving you guys an example you know just because it's darker doesn't mean it's bad but I take a hit of this life resident cartridge and we're gonna applaud whatever I just get mixed up by same pot and cartridge but we're not going to see what's the difference on it so I'm gonna take a blink row this life resin this is the lemon cookies I'm gonna see how it tastes [Music] Wow now the taste on it it's really fired to be honest the THC percentage it's a little lower than the distillate but the feeling you get on the throat is way different it's more like if you took a DAB like an actual diet and the taste on it it tastes so better it tastes it tastes so clean like it tastes like if you actually took like a DAB you know like the smell of it like you can literally taste like the actual terpene in it you know compared to the distillate you know the d\u00e9sol\u00e9e it does taste good but you do get like a little fakeness taste to it compared to life resin but it tastes pretty good you know I'm going to take another hit you know that's how good it is if you guys haven't had the lemon cookie you guys time how the lemon cookie won this one's pretty far ready going now to take another hit off to the [ __ ] taste so bitter [Music] but the light resident does run out a little faster than the distillate guys now now that we hear both of them honestly it's up to preference if you guys prefer life resin go ahead and drop a like or whatever let me know in the comments section of you guys prefer live resin or a distillate cartridge to me honestly I smoke any one it just depends you know I'm not really picky when it comes to smoking cartridges as long as they taste good and get any high as [ __ ] I'm good with that but that doesn't mean I'll get like the cheapest [ __ ] but you know I just like to try new [ __ ] not like I'll let you guys know if it's fire but to me honestly I'll [ __ ] with both but let me know what you guys preferred so now that we tried both of them it's time to abuse the share of these bad boys let's go ahead and hit both of them at the same time oh wow catcha is really good you know I see a lot of people that carry two batteries at the same time it's just one of them [ __ ] up so I had to get another one but ended up working all of a sudden so now I have to so that's pretty dope I really hope you guys stay safe out there while she got his hands coronavirus a [ __ ] so don't really want you guys to end up and catching it and nothing like that so you guys be safe out there take care of supra-conscious and you know and drop a like and comment what you guys would like to see next but peace guys", "DpXEya_eY2s": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka x420 and we're back here for another video guys it's just another chill-ass day it's actually nice and bright today it's actually pretty warm compared to the last couple days where it's just been cold and rainy and stuff um i'm out here in california but today guys man we're um this week has just been a budget week i bought a whole bunch of budget cards so your boy is doing budget cart reviews today so today i got a honey leaf and i'm trying this [ __ ] so you guys don't have to man but um honey leaves they're pretty cheap distillate but i've heard they're pretty good and i've never tried one or at least i've tried one but i've never tried one on the channel i've only tried them like you know in passing one of the homies had one so you know i ended up buying it but i got the northern lights and um it has 92 percent thc it's pretty freaking high in thc but that's a given with the distillate and it has 2.26 cbd guys so your boy we got the ursa bat today shout out to um ursa extracts i came home today and i got two packages um one from ursa x-straps and one from another company they sent me a gravity bomb but shout out to ursa extracts i love the lanyards because i love wearing a battery around my neck you feel me if i ever get big you know i won't have a chain your boy's gonna have lanyards with like different cards like different lanyards with different carts on it feel me so let's open this baby up and let's get into it [Music] like i'm not a big dislike fans but these carts are like 20 bucks 15 20 bucks a gram so when you hear that price you're just like huh should i try it should i try is it worth it do you guys think it's worth it so let's check it out see what it looks like [Music] the oil looks actually looks pretty good i'm not going to get a super close up but you guys can see it it's like a super gold color um darker than raw garden darker than a lot of distillate cards too in my opinion um but let's put it on [Music] and it looks like it's just in like some cheap cars not in an avd card or c cell it doesn't even have a name so you know you gotta watch out for those type of cards guys with either c cell or avd avd cards or one of the cards or any type of ceramic um but avd is um one of the big brands that are kind of dropping their carts and they have ceramic coils inside of them so they look like a normal sea cell but inside they actually have ceramic coils but shout out to ursa extracts man they got a full ceramic cart that's crazy so we might have to get pick up some ursa extract soon a strain that i haven't tried yet or something so cheers guys we're gonna take a rip of this northern lights it's not bad [Music] it's not bad but it's also you know not my type of flavor like it just tastes too much like it doesn't taste like they put any kind of terpenes or anything in it sorry i'm trying to get a fat rip i have it on red on this battery but if you guys don't know ursa strikes batteries uh they only go up to 2.0 voltage so sorry if it doesn't look like i'm hitting it but i'm actually i'm hitting this [Music] [Music] but this is good i guess if you're on a budget you need this lit but it's not the best distillate i don't know if it's just the terpenes they put in it or it's just because they barely put any terpenes or anything flavor but i don't know it just tastes like like basic distillate if you guys ever um had friends who just had a jar distillate and you ever just took in a dab or smoked a little bit of this religious straight distillate you guys kind of know it kind of tastes like that in a way [Music] man i gotta take super heavy hits to get nice hits off of this ursa battery but i do like the ursa battery but yeah guys man i don't know if i like this i would give this cart a rating like six six out of ten just because i would buy this if i was on a budget and this is all i could buy to get me through you know a couple weeks but i would rather go for a raw garden or a stizzy type distillate or any other this one's not as good like i think papa herbs is better than this one i would say papa herbs distill it is way [Music] better but yeah guys man today is just a chill day i just got back from work got some hennessy coming because if you guys don't know on saturday nights i like to drink a little bit of hennessy and smoke a bit with you guys a live stream and this saturday we might even be able to throw some gaming in there a little bit because i finally got fortnite and i finally have cold war on my computer so we probably could play some games too also if we wanted to you know shout out to all the people that are in the live stream man the live streams are actually starting to get a little more fun than the freaking the vlogs man i like the live streams actually um so i'm gonna start going live stream way more often guys um but i'm also doing more reviews i still haven't even tried um that noose dizzy strain that came out i bought i bought it and i just haven't even tried that out yet and i feel like everyone's trying but i'm gonna try that out and probably do like a wake and bake or story time but during the week it's kind of hard to like you know get out and do those types of vlogs because i'm just working but um yeah we're just trying the honey leaf guys man let me know if you guys ever tried honey leaves this is the northern lights 92 percent thc in this it's not bad i'd give it like a six but it's definitely not you know the best quality you know like if you're gonna choose a cheap cart just get a pop of herbs it's cheaper and it tastes better just tastes way better but shout out to everybody that made it this far in the vlog man don't forget to like comment subscribe more vlogs to come i just wanted to give you guys my opinion on this freaking cart but yeah guys more vlogs coming soon don't forget to keep watching guys and let me know if you guys have any suggestion on videos too i'm

further ado let's go ahead and get into the video G you already know we gotta be medicated so right here this is gonna be the limit head make a blinker as you guys call it nowadays fate your boy on the limit head let's go ahead and hit the Mojito know where to go ahead and get in this review [Music] [Music] take the blinker heads right there get it's nice and medicated let's get it shot the game alright y'all right here we have the mojito right here we have the lemon head Jacques and toe these are my dang fate so I know everybody be talking smack about these you know everybody has different opinions on them depending where you're at that depends on the quality you know depending who you're getting them from if you know what's filling them that's even better y'all so you know what depending on where you gotten from the [ __ ] everybody's gonna have like a different feel on them but basically your boys gonna go ahead and start writing these but the lemonhead first off I rate this one a 7 out of 10 yo the quality on this one the oil is stick yo y'all can see the oil stick it's not really moving at all takes a while to drip down the windows nice intake yo the flavors are right on the lemon head you kind of get the lemon head flavor on the exhale but on the inhale you don't really get no flavor it tastes kind of like the lemon peel to be real job but this one I'll have to rate a 7 out of 10 and definitely more of a body high type strain pretty tasty on the exhale besides like the lemon peel type vibe but I mean you still get the lemon flavor in there in general but yeah similar 10 body hi let me head right here by dancreep your boys gonna go ahead take another hit let's get gang [Music] getting nice and medicated right there yup I want to see these DAP pins right here for some reason it takes a minute to hit you boy just for the living head like probably about like a minute or two and then you start feeling the effects these are great for pain and stuff the THC and especially if you're not an illegal stage show that's the thing you're not a legal state these are very popular yeah as long as you know what's going in here everything should be good but um yeah lemonhead right here seven out of ten some watching the mojito y'all BAM got it right here in the CBD twist 650 let's go ahead take a hit it was gonna go ahead and review this one took a drink from our beer then blew that out and honestly the flavor my mouth right now is crazy and what I want to say about this mojito right here if you guys have ever had an actual real legit moan you know this is what it tastes like right here I don't know what they did with the turkeys and everything excuse me your boys died but the terpenes that they put in here is pretty [ __ ] good excuse your boy I think that definitely caught up to me I'm definitely faded tarentines stone to the boner no y'all but yeah this mojito the flavor on this one is pretty good it hits you instantly I would say way quicker than the lemon head I would say this one hits almost immediately up definitely hits me in between the eyes definitely in the face I would have to rate this one a high almost 10 you know almost like a nine point seven five or nine point five almost a 10 this one's almost perfect Joe y'all can tell the liquids nice and thick right here let's go ahead take another [Music] the flavor is definitely really limey on the inhale definitely extremely like kind of tangy kind of sour on the exhale you definitely taste it in your mouth definitely a hard hitter this mojito right here I would definitely ready to nine point five out of ten it's pretty clean ding Fame seal your boys opinion king-chavez trash or gas I would have to say gas you know depending on who's making them who's filling them because they are being filled by somebody in your guys local area if you guys don't know you can buy the packaging online and stuff but huh make sure you guys check him out make sure you guys go ahead and like try to get to know who's actually filling these holes that's all I really got to say about them but I'd go ahead and rate these gasps right here my favorite was the mojito out of the two but you know what boys shut up go ahead okay both these at the same time get extra medicated let's get a cha [Music] [Music] [ __ ] yes I already know what it is y'all should boyfriend Travis hope you all enjoyed this video right here I'll see you on the next one peace", "kyDnfHFKO70": "those dabs are no jokes that just ripped me oh my god hi friends welcome to that high couple where we explore and discuss our passion for cannabis today we are doing another delta 8 thc video quick recap that is a cannabinoid that is extracted from hemp cannabis plants it gives you a similar feeling to delta 9 thc that we all know and love but we sort of like to think of it as thc's little brother something that's not going to give you those same kind of paranoid effects from higher doses but i think the biggest surprise from this video is that i had no idea how many different ways you could apply delta eight for this video we've partnered with hometown heroes based in austin texas using hemp grown here in the united states they extensively work with veterans and a portion of all proceeds goes to help the vfw and the dav they sent us this big box so let's pop open this box and dive into it so let's start with the way that we've already at least featured on this channel before which is using a cart so we've got a 510 thread vaporizer cartridge here it's got 600 milligrams of delta eight and it is flavored after strawberry coffee and because it's a 510 thread cart you can pretty much put it into any battery is good for those carts and install it click a button and you're good to go oh cheers alice there we go i love it get this started oh nice big hit off of that yeah does kind of remind me of this kind of cotton candy flavor to it especially with the strawberry cough oh yeah really nice flavor it's not like overly sugary candy but this is this is good i would not mind smoking on this all day long so another way to consume delta eight is actually by smoking moon rocks kind of like a turducken of cannabis you take bud you take wax you take keef you push it all together into this crazy kind of hash sort of looking like thing and you can easily add it to a packed bowl or even sprinkle it into a little bit of a joint what this is is cbd bud with delta 8 distillate on top and then rolled again in cbd keith another very easy way to consume delta 8 is actually with delta 8 infused edibles edibles everybody loves edibles yeah we are looking at three different flavors gummies are kind of the go-to for edibles i love that i'm looking at pink lemonade fruit punch and blueberry and blueberry so these have 25 milligrams of delta eight per gummy and there are ten gummies in each container pretty good off of this vape i've taken a couple hits a bit yeah it's it's not that i'm high because i know what that feeling is this is different but i do feel pretty chill pretty uplifted that's what's so great about delta 8 is that i feel like we could dabble in every single way here and not get so floored that we couldn't get off the couch because that's not what the whole point of deltate it's to give you a kind of milder experience so cheers cheers everyone yeah that's good get a little gummy definitely don't taste the cannabis i don't taste any cannabis in this whatsoever if i just ate this out of a candy jar i would not know it's inedible what's great about these two is that it's kind of in the same genre as cbd which a lot of states have legalized and are allowed to ship and everything like that go ahead and check out the website for like exact details on bi-state specifications but pretty much all of this can get shipped nationwide which is really cool great way to experience cannabis a very popular cannabinoid without worrying that you're like breaking the law this is only one cannabinoid off of thc is delta nine that's delta eight exactly right another edible way of experiencing delta eight we have a couple of different tinctures usually one of the strongest ways to feel the effects of cannabis definitely the strongest in this box yeah yeah this is each bottle comes with 1200 milligrams that's insane 40 milligrams of delta eight per milliliter with tinctures usually it's good to just do them right under the tongue absorbed into your body really quickly tend to take effect really quickly great way to infuse food too if you're doing any kind of cooking add a couple of drops of this to it and like bam your whole meal is now infused this is the natural tincture this is mint tincture and this is berry i'm gonna try a little berry oh going for it you know i'll try a drop of the mint it's like a i was expecting it to be a little bit more syrupy but it's flavored water almost yes there's there's a lot of different almost like mouth sprays mouthwash that kind of reminds me of i mean this is also the mint so i'm definitely getting that's true that's true you should be feeling the effects of these very quickly i know i'm already just now starting to feel the first effects of the pen getting in front of the camera you're just like oh what's the next thing going but this i'm just like in the flow of it right now yeah there is just kind of an uplifting sort of happy mood and we haven't actually smoked any thc today so this is all just purely a delta eight high rolling on to the next product i see what you did there we're looking at this roll-on topical i know you can infuse delta nine you know thc with different topicals especially because it works really well for like veterans for anyone that has chronic muscle pain you can roll it on to very specific pain points on your body relaxation it has a kind of like i i rubbed a little bit on my arm earlier and it has a kind of like minty tingle feeling as well yeah i could actually see this working really well for any kind of a like post workout regiment um i did just roll a little bit on my arm and i do see what you mean there is kind of like a cooling like very light tingling effect feeling really good if you've got any kind of like neck or back or muscle cramps of just rolling that in and feeling the medicine get inside that's great nothing to do with like smoking or eating i this could not be easier for anyone that is totally adverse and afraid of cannabis in general the last way to use delta a that i was really surprised at hometown hero is

so delta 8 up", "FVVKvVeIaMw": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman officer honey stick and today we're gonna bring you a real informative video on how to build your perfect dab pen and tank basically your wax pen or dab pen is made of two components the first component is going to be your dad pen battery which we can see lined up here from very simple to complex so you need to have a battery which is essentially your powder plant for your dab unit then you're gonna need to pick out a wax tank which is what you fit the wax into that is actually going to vaporize your wax and what I mean wax or dabs we can talk all the way from you know oils that really hard enough to be to go into solid state all the way to your crumbles your shatters and things like that and you're pressed waxes then as you can see I've also arranged them from simple which is in this term small and then all the way up to big pro size over here which is gonna be more complex now I want today's video not to be too long but just to give you a really good basic idea of when you're trying to put together the perfect wax or DAB vape set that you pick out the perfect dab pen battery and also your wax tank so let's get started if this kind of mix and match is foreign to you at the very end the last two minutes we're gonna run through that we've already paired some and put together some awesome kits for you so if you're unsure you can always pick up already a pre-selected kid that is meant to work for your wax and vape pen needs very very well so let's get started let's start first with the power plant the wax or dab battery so for your wax pen battery or your dad pen you it depends on how big of a tank you want if you want something relatively slim and sleek you can pick up one of these stick batteries right here like this is our elf battery it has three different voltages and you can use any kind of slim wax tank or wax atomizer as a power plant just note that you're gonna want whatever wax atomizer you get should be skinny to match the circumference or the diameter of your battery so if you pick up an extreme tank never mind that this isn't powerful enough to power it you know let's this this would look pretty odd so let's say that for thin batteries you definitely want to pick a slim atomizer so out of our slim batteries we have a whole slew of colors for the elf which is a simplest least expensive buy in here that gives you good power and then you can step up to the twist batteries the twist batteries are one step up which you can twist adjust the voltage this is our phantom carbon fiber twist battery but we also have some twist batteries and other colors in our honey stick line so for the stick batteries you can really step up to two of our slim atomizers which is our phantom wax tank or our silencer both these tanks there's slight differences the phantom wax tank has a dual core power plant the silencer has a slightly larger bowl with a proprietary silica carbide interior both of them do have ceramic bowls but they do use the internal power plants this one's dual ceramic this one's silica carbide I can take it off and show you just so you see here go so here's a little side-by-side let's get real nice and close you can see the inside there here's the silencer just slightly larger bull diameter and then here's the phantom wax ink which is a dual core coil so these are slim these will work real nice with your stick batteries you can pick out the color you want the texture you want whether you want it to be a twist or a variable voltage stay away from Auto draw stick batteries when using your earwax tanks because push buttons generally do give you more consistent power output which is required for the best wax experience so moving right along in our dad pen batteries here if you don't want to stick battery because it might stand out a little bit or it might be kind of tall like this combination you can always go the concealer route and pick up one of honey sticks awesome concealer units which a concealer unit basically means that the unit gets hidden inside of the actual atomizer so let's take our beekeeper 2.0 multi dab pen battery or wax pen battery here and show you what it look like if we paired it with our silencer all of a sudden it is concealed in a small and compact you have more capacity you gonna need some less charges when you go with these bigger batteries and it's gonna keep your wax atomizer hidden it's gonna look really really cool this is also about the same size as a phantom tank this isn't a phantom tank but they're about the same size that's about how it would look there with if you've got the Phantom tank you can do that or you can upgrade to our if you want more features like digital functionality and concealment you can get our bee box Pro which is fully digitally adjustable screen here as you can see to really let you hone on power and this is one of our little flip units so now all of a sudden you a concealer that is all like a key fob real high quality flip and is an awesome little dab pen unit now so you can go with one of the concealers they're digital we also have our our arrow B battery which allows you full temperature control on your wax unit you see it's paired here with the silenced or it fits and real nice if you want something that's luxurious and has a real luxury feel with a few temperatures but it's still simple if one of the digital units is a little too complex I mean if you pair it with our Phantom's signature I mean look at this pairing this is just gorgeous right here this is a luxurious wax pen you get about thousand milliamp hours I mean you're this thing you're gonna be able have about two charges worth of a stick battery two to three charges a stick battery to one charge on this thing that's how much capacity it has it's got the carbon fiber feel and handle this right here is an awesome pairing for the concealer luxury route so that pretty much covers the slim the slim lacks tanks here that we discussed now when you step up to larger wax tanks you're gonna also need a larger dab pen battery which lets get into this section here so what honey stick has is we really have three offerings we have our stinger battery we have our defender battery and we have our sport battery the sport battery and the defender battery are both digitally adjustable and very high output the sport battery has a little bit more sophistication with different temperature wattage and voltage controls and it also goes all the way up to 50 watts of power our defender carbon fiber battery is what powers up our Cannabis Cup kit it runs up to 36 watts you can adjust the voltage or the wattage and what's cool about is you have a little ego adapter so you can actually run slim tanks off of it just as well so if you flip this over you can still put on a slim tank or a 510 prefilled cartridge just make sure that you have your wattage or voltage turn way down because this battery does have a lot of power with our defender option you have several really cool designs that you can choose from to make this battery customizable those are our digital options or very high power but if you're getting a slim tank you might not necessarily need all that power and they're also a little heavier and a little larger as you can see for example compared to our phantoms and concealers you know they do carry a little bit more heft but they put out a lot more power so if you don't want digital adjustability but you want some high power our stinger battery that we sell here has three temperature options as you can see which should be indicated by the different color in the LED it has a good high capacity but again it's very simple charge at the bottom three temperatures but you would need one of these batteries if you want to get into let's check out these these wax tanks now that we just went over dab pen batteries if you want one of these tanks starting with our aficionado tanks which we have a ceramic and a dual quartz in you need more power and the more power can only be attained with the larger dad pen batteries you have a doughnut option as well as a dual quartz and these are thicker so that are going to require some more power but they also have the larger bowls so these are gonna work well but you're gonna need at least one of these stinger batteries or defender or sport batteries to power these babies up now we also have our stinger battery which is a ceramic doughnut coil this is for those taste aficionados it's a standard ceramic doughnut ceramic body all around this pairs very well with our battery as well as these other ones but you don't want to run this one over 12 watts so it does acquire more power than the stick batteries put out but you don't want to overpower them with any of these big batteries that I had over here so you have a stinger then if you want to step it up we have our dual chords very popular tankful last year or two is our hybrid it's a dual quartz bull and it has this open chamber so you can really see the vapors really good taste purity has a very large sized bowl and dual quartz this is a good unit in that 15 to 20 watt range to really step up the power if you're hooking it up to a bubbler I mean this thing puts out a lot of power but you're gonna need more than just your slim stick or concealed batteries to power it up so again that limits you into the stinger the defender of the sport battery then if you really want to go extreme pun definitely intended you can go with the extreme tank which you can run on a triple course as you can see here I mean these are monster triple courses in the bull this is our most powerful tank I mean people compare this thing to a pocket rig because it really puts out rig style power you can have the triple course or you can have the big ceramic doughnut we sell both coils and both options do come in the kit for this thing you are actually it is so powerful that you're gonna need more than a stinger battery to power this thing up this thing isn't even going to give this the power that needs so you would be forced into the defender or the sport options for this so I hope that this part was informative on showing you what you can kind of mix and match between the dad Penn batteries and the wax batteries and also the wax tanks dab atomizers that you have here that are offered on honey stick a la carte so you can mix and match if this video was confusing for you you can always pick up one of our ready kits like our cannabis cup kit which pairs our stinger battery and our hybrid you can pick up our plasma kit which we didn't go over because it's not 510 thread so it's not mix and match this proprietary it has a cords coil that doesn't actually touch the concentrates really cool unique new pen we have our stinger which combines our stinger battery and our stinger atomizer for a perfect little ceramic donut kit for on-the-go if you're looking for something convenient and disposable we have our rip and ditch now for the environmentalists we aren't promoting running through these things these are for a matter of real travel convenience should be kind of a last resort from there if you're looking for a pen that you want to dispose of so we're not promoting throwaway culture so if you're looking for something small caliber check out our name Dabra kid it combines our silencer and our twist battery kit fully rechargeable awesome little kit so very inexpensive - so you could definitely step up from the disposable to that and the small caliber kids if you want a little bit more but don't want a lot of space we have our aficionado kit which combines both these nice atomizers that I showed you earlier let's take a little look which has a ceramic doughnut as well as a double quarts large sized bowl this is actually a 5/10 battery high capacity it even has a place for an apple charger on it for a rapid charge very small slim sleek very cool pen but it is wider than the slim tanks then the slim batteries that we went over so it's gonna put out good power so real good end between unit then if you want to go extreme you like that that pocket dab rig kind of feeling that gives you the max power that's kind of the cream of the crop the Best of Breed we have our extreme wax kit on our site for a really good price of 129 it comes with an extreme tank a sport battery the two coils and the mouthpiece and are in a different mouthpiece here which two mouthpiece options from the extreme which is really really a beast it comes in this awesome hardshell case for your on the go it is probably the best large you know still pocket-sized large caliber large output wax pen kit you can get super high quality the combination as you can see here is really really like they were made for each other I mean just look at the silvers and stainless as complementing each other here I mean this is this is a gorgeous kit and you're not going to find something that can fit in your pocket your purse or whatever that is more powerful and hits like this thing then if you want something really unique the reason we didn't go over any of its parts is because again it's not 510 but you want to be concealed a Ripper 2.0 has a beast of a wax atomizer in there it's a large bore large output dual quartz wax atomizer in there that is full concealer that is subohm caliber so as you can see this concealers this big butt has basically the same power as these larger batteries it's a unique proprietary blend looks just like a little lighter even clicks and flips like one buttons right there only one temperature little extendable mouthpiece if you unscrew this just mouthpiece the wax atomizer comes out you you don't screw it take a look at those dual quartz coils we're talking about monster concealer hits in here very high sub-ohm power those are thick coils and they get very very hot you'd fit a good amount of wax dabs into there and it's gonna be really good use but it's not a 5-10 thread it's its own proprietary magnetic bottom so I

we're bringing you the latest addition to our honey stick 510 slim tank family which is our full ceramic honey stick tank now a lot of comments that I've gotten in the YouTube channel since we've started whenever we're launching cartridges and emails I've gotten from from you guys of viewers as well as my extraction clients and partners that we make cartridges for is they want something that is a hundred percent heavy metals safe state of California as they have cracked down on eliquids and a lot of other things because they are definitely ahead of the health curve and an innovator in the cannabis curve has outlined that certain cartridges once they've been prefilled have contained heavy metals and those may be harmful for you so they are still testing all of that and not all the research is in but a lot of companies and a lot of you guys out there like hey I want a cartridge that I make sure there's absolutely no heavy metals in it because I don't want to take the chance and rightfully so so we had cartridges made and brought in and they're now available on our website that passed the phase three heavy metals test of California before we even brought them in our manufacturers had already been working with with California we told them the designs we wanted and these came back and passed the test because they are 100% ceramic on the interior ceramic on the exterior they use a ceramic heater and do not use any heating components that will set off the heavy metals test and also they're the only ones that pass all those tests with flying colors and we can really sign off on and say it lives up to the honey stick performance now all of our other tanks we have sent over we are testing and we will get those published as the industry moves more towards that but we want to be ahead of the curve and make sure we offer something for you guys so this right here our full ceramic cartridge we have them available and are already private labeling these for a lot of our extraction partners and a half mil size so that's a half gram and also the 1 gram size which is the one milliliter capacity cartridge now these are gonna be full ceramic interior body if we can zoom in and get a nice close-up as you can see you have a full ceramic interior body center post bottom base medical grade silicone gaskets sealing the bottom pieces which the blocks are also made out of ceramic and it has a ceramic heater core power plant now you say oh you know that's all good and well it's safe but does it vape up the challenge and yes it does these things definitely do hit hard and they vape well and because of ceramic in tin internals they're gonna maintain a really nice flavor of purity for all you purists up there you're definitely gonna get more of those turf tastes out of here because it is not interacting with anything except for the pure coated thick grade ceramic now the heater actually people say okay what's the orifice hole size now this has a unique orifice hole and I'm not sure you can a hundred percent get this onto the camera from this angle but it is a dual two millimeter valack kind of a moon shaped heater absorption system so you're still get a lot of good absorption you're gonna get a nice vape cloud it's not gonna you know run into any bad situations when you're putting the thicker oils or CBD oils or distillates in there you know this cartridge is made to perform so you also have the medical grade silicone internals as I said to make sure this thing is sealed up and doesn't leak and you have the the full ceramic mouthpiece that is gonna feel nice on the lips and is also going to be sturdy as well as easy to clean now these are not one use tanks however they are disposable so you could get a handful refills out of them as long as your key easier gentle with them because they are ceramic you do have to be a little bit more gentle with them even though the glass is a high quality of Pyrex grade glass you do have to be gentle with them because the ceramic internals are not metal and they if you bend them or put a lot of pressure on them ceramic does have the tendency when you put unneeded pressure on them to break so be a little bit more delicate with these tanks however know that you are getting a good bang for your buck now how do you fill these up and what are some of the tips that that I can give you guys when you're when you're filling these tanks and using these tanks because they are relatively new and innovative so when you have these tanks there we're gonna send them to you partially opened right there to make it easy you're gonna remove the mouthpiece and as you're gonna see you have a threaded ceramic shaft along with the little silicone gaskets these are gonna help give you the seal so you're gonna have the top mouthpiece that's also gonna have a little gasket that's gonna be a glass sealer because these threads are ceramic if you put a lot of pressure on them and twist because the ceramic threads have to line up you're gonna strip the ceramic and it is then going to compromise it's not gonna you know particle eyes or anything like that but it's gonna wear down and you are not going to have a good seal and if you leave your tank on its side they're upside down once it's been filled you do run a higher chance of leaking and you're not gonna have you know the fully sealed air flow possibly that you want so it might affect your rips as well so this is just a caution point this is why we do the videos so when you're putting them together you're gonna fill around the outside edges around the center posts you're gonna fill up with your oils or concentrates your CBDs and then you're gonna take this top and you are going to gently apply pressure and it's going to kind of stop and then you're just gonna twist and give it a little bit of prep just very little pressure and it's gonna take a little bit longer and then you're gonna feel the thread catch and the rubber gasket the glass is going to compress and as soon you feel the rubber gasket compress against the glass then you're gonna know that you are all sealed up there you go boom nice and sealed I wasn't pushing it out enough buddy there you go now it's nice and sealed it's flush I felt it it came to a stop do not overtighten the tank otherwise you're gonna run the risk of stripping it that's why I twist a little bit more times because I didn't want to put too much pressure on it I gave it a little bitty push it was enough I gave a little bitty more push and the thread caught perfectly and now it is all lined up it is sealed and you are ready to vape just remove this end cap here screw this on to your favorite 510 thread battery and yes this does work with auto draws as you see the little air hole on there I don't know if you could zoom in to see the little air hole so it does work with auto draws screw it on to your favorite battery and give this thing a try so again if you're looking for a purist experience something that passes the latest legislation inspections in the California extraction community and want to tank the rips and taste good definitely check out this honey stick

with another CBD and flower review now I am super excited about today's review we have an amazing product over hope is gonna be amazing from the vendor we've seen on the channel before my CBD Haven my CBD Haven has my opinion probably the best CBG and CBD concentrates you could get currently well they just change the game and they release read what that says delta 8 THC distillate syringes you might be wondering what is delta 8 THC well the THC that is illegal is Delta 9 THC there are other forms of THC in cannabis THC a THC v delta 8 THC Delta 9 THC is obviously the most psychotropic the most strongest the most noticeable it's the thing that really gets you high and that's why that's what is illegal in most places Delta 8 THC is not illegal it's legal so just proving your started in case you're wondering right now man this is too good to be true yes you can order it in all 50 states it's not illegal it's not Delta 9 THC this is Delta 8 THC which is not illegal does Delta 8 THC still get you high to put it bluntly yes is it as strong no he says racy rushy no no no from just from what I've heard in my research everything I know Delta 8 THC is kind of like a watered down version of regular juice definitely stronger than CBD stronger than CVG but not as strong as THC or I should say noticeable or psychoactive and with that means that it doesn't cause as much anxiety we got Delta 8 syringe we also have CBD syringe and a little vial of the same stuff in each here goes the delta 8 and this is the CBD with my CBD Haven logo we also have test results all right so we're gonna start off with the CBD distillate and that CBD comes in at four hundred point two seven milligrams all the COA the test results with a small amount of CPG CBN and CBC so that is a nice combination a nice smorgasbord of cannabinoids right there so let's see here goes it's a syringe and while I'm opening this the awesome thing about these syringes is you can use this oil to dab with you can dab it like wax you can make edibles with it a lot of people just simply enjoy putting it on top of flour rolling a blunt or smoking bowls of it and it does come with this little skinny applicator so so I'll give you up close that's what it looks like you unscrew the end of it out like that and then you put this in you screw it in and then then it's ready for whatever today I'm gonna be dabbing it so that we just get the pure effects of that I don't want to you know I would recommend personally putting this on top of flour to kind of you know intensify the experience but it since I'm reviewing it I want to tell you exactly how this feels [Music] [Applause] we're gonna squeeze this right into the banger Wow there's no flavor in that no harshness I mean it's my pure CBD distillate so I wouldn't expect any kind of harshness or flavor this is really really interesting now even though hitting concentrates like this usually does take effect immediately let me kick back for a few minutes and just let it fully sinking and I'll come back and let you know how I feel a few minutes later all right I'm back that was interesting it's just so interesting to feel CBD without any other little bit of THC or anything CBD by itself is very like it's not like psychoactive psychotropic it is very in the body and behind the scenes so I don't really feel any different right now maybe a little bit more relaxed but this type of thing is intense concentration of CBD this is really recommended for people that really need it for like medical reason so if you have some kind of ailment you know I don't know I'm not gonna go through the list but if you need a high dose of CBD and you need it quick this is perfect you know those little syringes are you know it's so convenient you can carry them everywhere like I said you could just roll these on top of a joint stick these on top oh really quick just a tiny little dollop distillate I have absolutely nothing to compare this to because I'd obviously never tried anything like this before but I'm gonna give it the sebastio approval I think if you really benefit from seeking you by itself this is a really good option to get a very high concentrated dose of it all right now to the main attraction the real reason you're here this is the Delta 8 THC cartridge 66.3% Delta 8 THC 0.62% CDN so 66.3% Delta 80 X and I'll just think about a few Mets with something at 66 percent Delta 9kc you're gonna be gone like you're gonna be in space packaging everything is the exact same deal appearances exactly same little syringe the little adapter piece to get it you know in a small amount you know same same deal we twist this piece off right here and then we twist this in and you do have to kind of handle it for a little while because at room temperature this kind of settles and hardens so you got to get it just a little bit of warmer than room temperature so that it starts to know so that you can you can get it moving down the row syringe so we're gonna handle this for a minute and I'll just talk while I do this I am THC sensitive like I told you before I love cannabis but I cannot handle the high concentrations of Delta 9 THC it just makes the experience unenjoyable for me like I know it does for many others in the hips and CBD community Delta 8 THC might be the perfect answer if you thought CBD was a perfect answer well this might be a way to enjoy th see without the negatives that come with it for some people [Applause] all right here goes to Delta Wow once again no taste no throat burn I come coffee is just irritated from inhaling something but absolutely no harshness nothing it's interesting I'm getting the most craziest sensation just like a wave going down my body and throughout my limbs Wow I know wow it's hitting me it's hitting me fast and it's hitting your heart and I want to break away for a few minutes but I almost kind of want to share this experience with you you've ever hit if you've ever taken a hit some really strong TMC flower concentrate and you know that feeling you can feel it come creeping on handy just you know and you could that's what this is doing right now it's just creeping along heavy and that's it's getting me this this is amazing there's like seriously right we thought CBDs would like the answer to our prayers I mean there are many people in McD's amazing CBD will forever be you know the standout aside from THC but there's Delta 88 see this this doesn't this feel like th it just doesn't feel like City this feels like so like strong hopes to make city but I'm not feeling literally any anxiety in Russian I don't feel my heart beating faster I'm not worried about nothing about what we're thinking anything I feel like I'm baked but my head is clear like I'm able to control my thoughts and food I just feel like yeah I feel like I'm Paris Thomas [Music] Wow Wow this is amazing this is amazing yeah I just I love I love how clear-headed I am I love how control I am of my own thoughts and everything my own feelings I'm not letting anything get the best of me this isn't invoking those kind of feelings and I think that's amazing well here it is it but it ain't here I think this is the answer to a lot of people's prayers a lot of people who want to enjoy cannabis and maybe CBD flour just doesn't do it for you a regular THC but it's too strong here you go right here you could thank me later I'm really glad I'm doing this review because not only am i reviewing the product yourself but I'm putting out some awareness about what Delta a THC is and what it does and that's awesome because I think it needs to be more focused on for sure I think that this is probably the best thing in cannabis and I think if you mix Delta eight with CBD you have the honest-to-god perfect combination Wow this is Bob this is Bob I'm sorry I can't shut up but this is absolutely bomb I have to stop myself someone just let me say this is one of the best things I have experienced in the hemp world since I first started using hemp flour and reviewing hemp flour this is I mean this is this is amazing more focus needs to be put on those Delta 8 THC and obviously this is concentrate so you know 66% Delta 8 THC so you know it's not this isn't light weight one tiny drop does it take my word for it I put just a tiny tiny squeak like the size of the drop of water and that's it that's all you need pretty sure this feeling is gonna last for at least a good 45 minutes to an hour I don't think I need to say do I need to say this gets the Shabazz silver pool now I believe there's other Delta 8 products out there they're few and far between my CBD Haven is a stand-up company I I could vouch for them this right here this right here this is dope definition soo cool I love this product I love what's in this product I really like look at this this looks official this looks official like you could whip this out people in like am like what you doing me like look at this do it over here this is spicy spicy pan I'm enjoying myself a little bit too much this is this is what you want just let me just clip on me a lot of you that's watching you

undercover police officer on several different occasions he had no problem whatsoever hitting on the hundred federal officer on the audiotape trying to pick her up and sitting there on their pigment in a bowl of oatmeal", "IxckcK20ET8": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna be doing some OpenCart surgery I'm just kidding we launched we've all been there a kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or just any type of oils or CBD mixing or injecting you definitely want to have one of these definitely come in handy I mean we've already had half of our employees have already taken them to go work on their graveyard of cartridges so definitely get a lot of use out of this get it will be

that [ __ ] is like homeless [ __ ] white gosh it looks like vegetable I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't I show you my personal information alright yo what's up guys are on your way back out true so I have another cartridge review for you guys in this video so I actually picked up two strains of his brand like I normally do but I only take apart and they have the Ewell's guys watch my video as you guys would probably know that I saw like I said I never tried I never like purchased these myself but my friend had one of these a couple days ago and I like guys I tried it like it's my friend let me like hit his pen so I have try these but I have tried these before and I was like actually like really impressed with them I'm not gonna lie and then like a couple days later that guy seemed to buy one get one free deal on them so I figured like their [ __ ] fire I liked them so why the [ __ ] not pick them up and also never did a video on them so it's like a win-win situation you know I mean I get some fiery cards for myself get some fire video is for you guys so um you know they man but well it's by the brand Delta eight I'm not sure if this is like a Arizona based company right I don't I don't know too much about the brand to be honest with you I probably did a little bit of research before making this video but if you guys want I guess this is their website history and that little shiny font just I lava calm so yeah Delta eight either or I guess the brand is I lava I guess that's like that's actually the brand nature this is the brand is I lava and unusually Delta eight cards so yeah got a little bit mixed up there but the brand is I lava and then Delta eight clarity that's the cards so you see I got Clementine and I got a pineapple Express so I got two different strains here this video we're gonna be reviewing the sativa the Clementine you guys want to see a video on the Pineapple Express so I'm gonna down below in the comments and there you know that that output the Clement time so like I said the brand is just I love but Delta eight clarity that's the name of the court so it's made with solvent free distillate it says it's obviously a sativa it's just around Clementine here's the front of the packaging I like how they put all like them I don't know what you really call this just like the colorful the colorful letters you know I mean it's just like a little small detail that makes it look good then the harvest day was for 24 yeah she was really nothing through fancy about the packaging I'll let you guys look at it real quick so you already showed you guys the front that's the front the side just says like don't store and like extremely blah blah the back thing like just as the Department of Health 1 and side besides the sticker you bend your back to the front there's nothing on the top and bottom just pull it out and then that's the little seal so I guess I said you know if it's been open or not so just open this up though take it out of the box nothing else in there this is what you're greeted with so that's looking [ __ ] stupid fire already in my opinion this packaging it's [ __ ] dope too like underneath the car says uh what does I say hashtag I love already I don't know that's pretty good out of the way we'd like the packaging look at this oil over hood like holy [ __ ] look at this oil look at the color on that that [ __ ] is like homeless [ __ ] white flash it looks like vegetable oil Voki you know what i mean like i should looks like water like that's just crazy let's look at the bubble [Music] yes and you see that should stick his [ __ ] the consistency should suck not moving the color [ __ ] is [ __ ] insane like look at that [ __ ] the clarity is [ __ ] insane you can see right through it [ __ ] read a book do it if you really wanted to yeah now that [ __ ] looks insane so let me know down below in the comments what do you guys think of it cuz I say it in every review but even though this is like my review we're gonna do I'm always curious to know what you guys think of it and um I forgot to say it earlier these parts or I think they're originally $60 but I've got them on the buy one get one free deals like I don't feel like 30 bucks each you know what I mean so 30 bucks each this is [ __ ] fire in my opinion I mean having smoke - yeah but just based off the looks you know I mean I'm happy didn't really go into that detail but like I said that's their website so if you wanna check my yeah if you want to check them out just I love the calm and every try this brand coming down below in the comments what you what you guys thought of them but let me take these little rubber pieces off and I'm just gonna be using my little basic CB 5 pen on this the homie over at CB 5 some company you actually hooked me up with this pen does that mean I think it's pretty [ __ ] dope I like the way it looks so I'm gonna use it but it's just the basic pan has like low medium high temperature settings and I'm pretty heat it's just a basic pan you know I mean nothing special but I'm just gonna put this [ __ ] on there we got the car in battery um one more look for you guys look at that [ __ ] beautiful oil that [ __ ] looks like I don't even know this looks amazing I sew climbing time sativa I love without the a carts um I guess the way we'll go over this is um I have like five factors that all like the importance reviews or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it on you know what I mean so the packaging and the aesthetic looks of it kinda already went on with that so I'll give that like that uh the packaging I'll give like a four and a half out of five it's so close to a five out of five I just wish they had like a little bit more information about the car and what you're smoking on the package and you don't I mean like if you've seen some of my other reviews you know some of the package and it says like what terms they use and just it gives more like information you know what I mean I wish this part or at the packaging would give a little bit more information about what you're smoking on but it's not really too big of a deal I guess you know what I mean but especially because it's from a licensed dispensary so you know it has to be always like [ __ ] clean you know what I mean but so the package in 4.5 out of 5 extremely close to a 5 the looks and the quality of the concentrate so this is like this without the taste high or anything just the looks I'm gonna give that a [ __ ] 5 out of 5 because that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] amazing that quality you like the thickness the consistency the [ __ ] uh clarity does everything about it bro it that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] insane and like I said if you guys disagree or if you guys just want to tell me something down below in the comments just let me know what you guys think like this [ __ ] just looks crazy like the color on how you know what I mean but the looks definitely got a 5 out of 5 so next up we're gonna do a taste test so alright so I have on the lowest temperature now I'm gonna preheat this out and then I'm gonna give a little taste test and then ice available do with a little high test I'll blow a couple fat like the taste test I'll do a couple small hits and see how it tastes the high test of capable a couple fatter it's see how I like smokes and all that [ __ ] see how the high is I'll go over the price point I guess I find out are doing over that a little bit but I do like that and then after that I'll do like that um I thought overall review like review the whole code um you guys are smoking long cheers I hope you guys are smoking something dank alright so yeah like I said if you guys are smoke but a long Cheers I hope this [ __ ] tastes [ __ ] fire and this [ __ ] get it Cheers [Music] oh yeah you definitely get that that Clementine that Clementine the Clementine tastes like right after that like get a straight like Honda sativa I mean it's obviously it's a sativa but you get that straight like sativa tation I mean you can find up like a citrus lemon lime taste yeah it definitely has like that lemony like citrus like Clementine is for sure 1% and difficulties that definitely [ __ ] fire I barely didn't really even hit it too hard and just saying I'd rather decent cloud these lights make it kinda harder for the cabin to pick up the smoke sometimes up a lot more smoke than it actually looks like but no this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire like that [ __ ] looks like the color of it still kind of blowing my mind bro like that [ __ ] is crazy I don't know this should it's like [ __ ] fire so far I'm gonna take like one or two minutes and then I'm going to taste the reading then we're going for the high test so Cheers like I said if you're smoking long list [Music] definitely straight that's pretty much all you really get I'm obviously you taste like a strong this little taste to obviously but on top of that you taste every strong like citrus lemon taste it straight Clementine like fire um a lot of cards kind of like I don't want like really name any cards like those shade and certain brands that I'm saying but I feel like some some cards or some like some brands that makes but like some brands that make cars that like will make out a card that's called like a Clementine card but I don't know they might use extreme specific types or some [ __ ] but in my opinion it'll taste nothing like the actual straining we're just actually tastes a lot like before this drink does you know what it means so and not only does it taste like does it taste like the strain it tastes [ __ ] good like it tastes good as [ __ ] so to be honest I think I'll get the flavor a 5 out of 5 this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired the packaging looks packaging his [ __ ] dope the looks of it a [ __ ] fire the way it [ __ ] tastes fire the high I can already [ __ ] tell the highest air like I'm already feeling that I've barely even hit it and I don't know why I mean I haven't really smoked today and I'm gonna smoke before my car reviews maybe I while I'm doing a little bit higher but no this is definitely some stupid [ __ ] fire but I mean put it on the medium temperature now so I'm gonna take a powder hit to see if I can blow I'd like to see what kind of clouds I can blow you know what I mean and then you kinda see what the pie of tips I get you know what I mean so it's get into that now Sophie I just smoking along too and [Music] [Music] whoo [ __ ] all right yeah so now this is I can only tell this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um I'll give it one more if you guys I don't want to get too high though they still got a record that pineapple Express for you in a minute but um I'll get one more fat hit for you guys you guys are smoking along seriously Dan and I [ __ ] get it so I don't know if you guys have ever seen my video I don't know if you guys ever see my i'm just like the lead cart reviews but um these are actually [ __ ] $40 for a half a gram and i think there were like it's 75 for the full gram so these are [ __ ] way expensive I think I said these are what sixties it's $60 for the for gram I think I prefer these over those like the lead car it's a hundred percent like a hundred percent I would rather have one Indian and they're cheaper too you know what I mean so I don't know that's just my thoughts and opinions the high high rating the way it hits it blows clouds are you guys can't oh so it's like the white smoke finish it I'll get on that before the five the high definitely gotta go in between a four and a half like now I'm gonna give it a four and a half out of five cuz for a car to be a five out of five is like extremely hard for me because I smoke so much [ __ ] wax so like it's like a different I don't know you know you know what I'm saying I mean I'm gonna be like at this yeah the heart rate indefinitely gets like a 4.5 out of 5 it's fire as [ __ ] but like it's not not real wax and I'm saying before a cart super fire there um hi like I said it's like one of my favorite cards probably like on my top - oh for sure it might even like I don't know I gotta hit it a couple more times like finish these two cards off and I'll let you guys know but but now I can already tell these have potential to be like my like number one like favorite go to cards especially when they have like the fire one get one free deal is getting me that they're you'd always a [ __ ] granite I don't like funny you can't beat that price you don't I'm saying so please like when they don't had to deal with those $60 is that something don't be a [ __ ] pricey 75 bucks for the lead guard that's pricey useful so I like props to them for making it like cheaper than no read cards I just like the week or it's not the throw shade on them because there's a fire - you know I'm saying but I don't know the high is definitely there so 4.5 out of 5 the price point so I know it costs a lot of money to like make some quality this lit so I mean it depends though guys like these companies obviously buying this [ __ ] in like super polka melts you know their names sounds really getting like Luigi Christ isn't they're probably profiting a lot but if you're not buying it uh-huh you know what I'm saying it still costs money to make quality this list so but for the quality of this oil in these parts the price point is a lot cheaper than a lot of the quality cards on the market like like for example like this like the meat carts that's like like these are tricked like like these are just as good like if not better than the select elite cards and they're $15 cheaper you know what I mean so props the [ __ ] I lava for that [ __ ] but but I cannot don't say that's like the delete I [ __ ] love them to what I love I'm just trying to give you guys like an example down the name I don't find the rambling now but the price point I'm looking at 60 bucks is still kind of expensive but if you get the buy one get one free deal that's a [ __ ] steal so I'm gonna give it a four and a half out of five and then the overalls for the car there's gonna be a 4.5 out of 5 I really feel like the only factor would be is that they were about $50 or $55 for the full room not I mean it's $60 for a 4 quart it's like still really [ __ ] expensive in my opinion because like he's like in my area at my dispensary I can get three grams or like concentrate for like $60 not I'm saying so I'd rather have like actually three grams of wax and a [ __ ] card so I don't know how that works out but I guess for the conveniency and the portability you know legit it's still fire I don't know but the courts definitely [ __ ] fire over all sport but yeah I don't know the card still fire or four point five out of five is overall score like I said definitely pick them up in their area for ever see them favorite ride then let me know down below in the comments besides that if you guys have any requests anything guys want to tell me - I'll blow in the comments stops for that - Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do you know what to do be on the lookout for the pineapple Express video and besides for that peace out", "JHuSstnceBE": "do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart review and this one I'm actually quite excited for it because I bought this just yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment below if you've got your own opinions bye", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "DjM05mkW8JE": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another video and i was bored you know just out here chilling like a villain caught up in my feelings listening to you know them heartbreaking music songs you feel me and i was like i got two [ __ ] carts on me right now i should just do a card review right now while i'm out you feel me guys so i got a new pop of herbs that i haven't tried the z skittles and then i got a bloom and i didn't mean to get this bloom actually feel me i meant to get a live resin bloom but i ended up getting a disjoint guys so [ __ ] it i'm hella high already guys so let's [ __ ] get into this [ __ ] let me just put a [ __ ] camera down for a second though so guys so guys i've been smoking on that kingpin but i'm pretty much at the end of it guys so let me unscrew this real quick you feel me kingpin as you can see it's pretty much empty and first off guys we're gonna try the bloom guys because the balloon i haven't tried yet before and if the dish looks good if the bloom dish shield is good guys then the live resin's gotta be good so it's a bloom it's a skywalker indica you feel me and there's a cannabis digital pure terpenes and terpenoid profile so the terpenes and the profile i think come straight from the bud guys there you go boys slides open like that comes in a little nice little red capsule [ __ ] you i hope no one pulls up on me [Music] i hear somebody skateboarding right now guys someone's skateboarding but yeah it almost looks like uh raw garden the way it's made like at the tip and then the oil it looks almost like a raw garden well let's test it out on the bat and then you know i got my discreet battery on the go but we're not actually gonna put it on because i'm gonna put the other cart on so [Music] shit's fire [Music] damn this is actually not a bad dish it actually has that flour taste but it also has like a fruity taste to it i don't know if that comes from the flavor i don't think i've ever tried skywalker og string [Music] we get loaded [Music] but this [ __ ] is actually pretty [ __ ] flavorful guys [Music] yeah i had to get this bloom for the one time but honestly i prefer live resin guys so i'm probably gonna get a live resin on this but this is pretty good guys if you're into dish lit i think bloom is actually [ __ ] pretty good like bloom and stizzy is you can't get i don't know because stizzy you can't get no better than stizzy and then stizzy also has you know live terpene carts live resin and distillate but if you guys don't want to buy a stizzy pod the battery and all that get yourself a bloom this [ __ ] actually is pretty fire hopefully this vlog comes out good i'm just in one spot guys like i'm walking over this bridge like stoner moments guys oh guys i wanted to talk about that what if i made a vlog talking about all the thoughts that come in my head when i'm [ __ ] stoned guys like what if i made that type of vlog like for instance like i'll give you guys a [ __ ] um i'll give you guys an example so one time one time when i was high i was talking to my friend my boy nick and i was like bro what if like we didn't have to pay taxes on some some crazy [ __ ] i'm not saying this will work i'm not saying this will work but what if we could pay taxes guys so and then instead of paying taxes you feel me we have to go out and clean the earth you feel me clean the oceans lakes you know clean the things that we can clean replant you know trees and whatnot and stuff like that like what if what if that was like [ __ ] real like that was just a high moment i had with him and i was like trying to change the earth and everything trying to heal the planet because like because the planet does need healing guys and like someone has to do it and i was just thinking about like what if we just didn't pay taxes instead of paying taxes we know we clean up the earth what do you guys think tell me in the comments yeah yeah but this cart it's [ __ ] fire guys i honestly was gonna get rid of this when i bought it i was just gonna give it to someone because i'm not really much of a distillery person but i'm gonna keep this and this is going to be my daytime stoney pen right here but um let's try the papa herbs guys the papa herbs so this is the z skittles you feel me it's an indica 2 and it has 81 percent thc and the bloom had 84 [ __ ] so the bloom has more thc but that's because the bloom is distillate and i usually have a higher thc volume or whatever yeah i think that's the right word value i don't know correct me but it has higher thc and this is actually a live resin i talked to them on instagram and their instagram guy said that papa herbs is a live resin so this is actually live resin guys and sorry if the lighting gets a little weird it's starting to get dark so i'm probably going to end this one quick you feel me let me rip it open hopefully you see it that normal golden goodness you feel me so you feel me it looks like that typical uh papa herbs karch like that typical gold like it looks creamy almost i forgot what word my friend used but he used a good ass word for it and man this [ __ ] just always looks good hold on i gotta screw it on real quick but yeah papa herbs has always been [ __ ] fire [ __ ] flame like i give them i put them up there with [ __ ] raw garden right now with consistency on each strain that i've tried like it's been bomb there's been no bad ones really like shout out to papa herbs i actually bought some of their concentrate so i might do a freaking vlog tomorrow when i get that tomorrow morning i will be getting some concentrates and yeah we're going to take some dabs i actually want to do a vlog with willow g hopefully he wants to do one soon and we're going to get it in but yeah thinking about a dab for dab vlog willow g tell me what you guys think okay okay okay this one's a little bit different but it's like i don't know how to explain the flavor it's like uh it's more earthy i thought it would be more fruity but honestly it tastes more earthy than the other one i guess that's because it is live resin i would honestly get the granddaddy perp over the z skittles guys but it actually isn't that bad it isn't that bad but but we out here chilla this is just a short vlog for you guys tell me what content you want if you guys want me to give you my stoner thoughts let me know the thoughts i have when i'm stoned but i want to do an another wake and bake i want to do a hot box i want to do a late night sesh so a lot of vlogs are coming soon um don't forget to like comment subscribe and dude always good vibes guys thanks for always watching my vlogs all the people that hit me up in the ig all the people that hit me up on snapchat i see you guys i hear you

[Music] so i'm gonna end it right here because i don't want it to be too long peace out guys yeah [Music] oh", "3lfY0yL0Bwg": "okay so you've got your distillate you've got your terpenes and you mix it in a pen how strong should you make the flavor well that's really dependent on how your customers like your pens how do you know that without experience my name is Drew owner of mr. extractor comm and my terpenes are in millions of pens across the country and have been for years I'm gonna tell you the truth about how strong you should make your pens in this week's episode how strong should I flavour my cartridges from the terpene Institute okay so you don't want to make a pen that's too strong and you don't want to make a pen that's not flavorful enough so what do you do well I can tell you what a lot of other people are doing and I can tell you what's popular in the industry right now again we serve in Los Angeles and Los Angeles is one of the epicenters for pen manufacturers all across the country well like it or not they make millions of pens and ship them all around the world we get a lot of good feedback on what people do and don't like so I'm just gonna share that with you and save you some time but remember it always boils down to what your customers like don't worry about what you like don't think so highly of yourself your customers are gonna like what they like now we all may be natural organic people who don't like anything but maybe your customer just wants a bubble now always listen to your customer first but let me give you an idea of where we're at so we're finding that in Los Angeles with the real large manufacturers that are making hundreds of thousands and millions of pens a year there's a certain amount of terpenes that you need in order to liquefy your distillate to work and that's usually at about 10% say 10 to 12% now that functions correctly in the pens to good pens but what we're also finding is that the customers want it stronger than that reason is the distillate tastes like [ __ ] it doesn't taste good tastes like plastic to me I don't like it now that is the component that gets you high and everybody wants their strengths or remain high but I also tell everybody look I'd rather take an extra hit of something that I really like the flavor of then one less hit of something that I didn't the flavor up and that extra hit equivalents out to you just thinning it down a little bit more and giving it a little extra flavor so we're recommending right now at about fifteen percent or even a little bit higher you don't want to over liquefy your product you have to find the balance between what your cartridge can handle versus the flavor that it's giving customers are liking the more flavorful profiles they want to taste it they want to hit it they want to experience it they want that flavor but you can always just do some trials I always recommend trials never mix up some massive batch unless you've tried it we batch test everything small batch everything always you should if you're a manufacturer that's common practice small batch something give some trials out we give samples out to people get the feedback and adjust it larger and larger and then work your way up to it so right now trend is airing on a little bit more of the flavorful side and we're finding equal sales in cannabis profiles versus flavored profiles actually the flavored profiles are picking up the fruit flavors they are kind of outpacing the cannabis stuff right now people taste the weed for a long time it's kind of a new thing to taste something that tastes like strawberry banana or bubblegum so do some tests I recommend that you find a group of people that you work with that are just really good users and give them some free stuff and have them tell you what you like or what they like and sample it out more and more but what I recommend watch the video on how much to dilute your pins but dilute your pens and do it a little bit more cuz that's what people seem to like right the terpene Institute was founded on just giving you a simple common-sense understanding of how to operate in the cannabis industry and how Tarpons work without all the [ __ ] of social media social media sucks because they're preying on you sometimes they just want to influence you so you buy their product I'm already doing well enough to where I just want to help you create a good business okay so go to the terpene Institute I'm gonna give you a no-nonsense common-sense understanding of all the different aspects in terpenes and cannabis if you have a question I'll put a form on there fill it out I'll probably shoot a video of it alright if you want to try any of our terpenes go to mr. extractor comm we've got tons of amazing profiles you can start your own business or you can just add terpenes so the millions of pens you're already doing we sell gallons and gallons and hundreds of gallons of this stuff alright my name is Drew owner mr. extractor thank you for watching and I'll see [Music]", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "HQc9FXLOkiM": "what is up YouTube family boy baths is here I'm gonna be doing another cartridge of you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you

into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "sJNxWvWjCSo": "how's everybody doing this gelatine connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today so today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking some millenium extracts blueberry which is a 70 percent THC and we are going

going to fill the cartridge with take your cartridge remove the mouthpiece now you're going to want to take your applicator and put it as far into as possible then slowly begin to dispense your oil into the cartridge [Music] if you have a very thick oil you'll see that it takes a while to move farther down into the cartridge that's just something that takes a while to do make sure you get as much of it as far down as possible we're going up filling up the rest of the cartridge once it is full leaving a little bit of space [Music] take your cartridge would you know filled with oil put the mouthpiece back on it's over screw it closed now we're going to take this cartridge and let it warm up a little bit and that all those bubbles float on out of there so here it is all ready to go this is the eye crusher JC 105 as you can see right there I crusher it's a very popular 510 thread Partridge we are going to be trying this out on our ego - very nice battery we've had for a while all

parts Mart calm you make sure you swing over there and have a look at them if you're looking for some cartridges to refill they've got a very nice widest orbit well thanks for tuning in uisidenav salute wonderful day peace", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me

yeah if you got a taste for it you know exactly what you want if you don't smoke tsc very much excuse me i mean taste and flavor-wise yeah that's worth the money that's why it's worth any dollar

see you in the next video you", "cU3_ZwBvf7Q": "hey what's up guys welcome to dev connection and here i got the herb delta 8 thc cartridge now um all what delta 8 really is in a nutshell um is just it's simply a form of cannabinoid right and it still has a similar properties to thc and delta 9 and all that stuff and still delivers good effects you know it's not as strong as regular thc cartridge you get from your dispensary but you can still get really nice effects and it's uh we recently actually reviewed a delta three shy delta thc and those ones actually liked a lot they uh they have a seesaw cartridge hardware so they deliver really good hits and i was surprised with the high right but these are herb a and um taking a closer look i like the packaging a lot like this is pretty cool so it stands the whole time never falls down but i thought it was a c cell right and i realized once i like unscrewed it and everything it is not a c cell this is a it's ceramic coil so that's good but there's no improvements and there's no imprints on the anywhere around it and it's uh i don't know i could just tell the way until it wasn't a c still just by hitting it to be honest because the hardware is not that great it gives really light hits it's uh uh yeah like i said after hitting it i knew um you could tell right away because it just delivers really smooth really soft hits or really light soft hits but um as for the taste i mean the oil is really good it looks really good it's like doesn't move at all the taste is uh here we have two different strains we got chill indica and sweet sativa and uh sweet steve is actually lemon haze that's what i'm actually smoking right now it's uh the taste doesn't deliver that there the cartridge doesn't or this strain doesn't deliver that great flavor to be honest like it says it's lemon haze but i don't know i didn't hear i didn't really get that good of a taste it isn't really i don't know it just kind of takes a little harsh burn and just doesn't really deliver that great taste taste here i'll show you i'ma hit it right now and see show you guys all right yeah so i don't know if you saw that but this uh this cartridge delivers really soft hits and when i pull it when i pull to suck in like smoke it actually feels like i'm pulling kind of hard you know so i didn't like the hardware at all and the cartridge itself it doesn't taste good it tastes burnt to be honest it has a harsh flavor but it has a harsh taste but delta eight is a cannabinoid that is like known to be harsh itself the three-shot delta was pretty harsh but i still like the taste of it way better and they use they actually use sea salt hardware but and like i said the main thing with these cartridges is if they had you see some hardware that'd be so much better because um here's the challenger right it actually broke on me i uh pulled it out this didn't break here right i pulled it out and i already got most of the oil out and um i always hate taking out oil or replacing oil to another cartridge because you'll always lose some oil you'll always lose some oil regardless how good you are at it uh even if it's a little bit but still you know it's like who wants to lose oil you know but it didn't break from here i pulled that part out but right here is where it broke this piece came off i tried pushing it back in and just pushing it as hard as i can but it didn't work i didn't even push it that hard i just you know push it in to see if it would um fit back on and hit but no i didn't work it just i ended up replacing the oil to an actual sea salt cartridge you know and it did hit way better than this and the you know i can't really say anything about this flavor because uh it when i hit it in this thing well the heart was way better right and it still has leftover like flavors from the other cartridge that i had so it gave it tasted a lot more like that you know so but as in regards to the flavors to this strain it didn't deliver that great taste it was harsh it was uh it was just all right effects wise it still delivers good like pretty good effects right like you actually get a pretty nice again a nice uh nice eye right it's not nearly not the same as a regular thc cartridge but at the same time it's a the way i see it personally is like a high or it's like a strong cbd you know it's like strong cbd or a high quality cvd or they're like high quality bait pen that's the way i see it you know but it still delivers great effects uh similar to a regular high not nearly as strong as a cartridge but still nice you know great alternative if you don't have access to thc cartridges or you know if there's a lot of sketchy sketchy brands out there around your area this is a great alternative but this one these ones in particular i wasn't a huge fan of you know i much prefer the three shy delta a thc that one is still harsh right after if you take long hits but it's still i don't know i felt it to be more potent and it was a lot way more tasteful i uh i really hope this one tasted better but i'm not too sure like i said and the taste like just wasn't that good effects were not nearly as strong as the deltae thc but they were still there you know and like i said this is a great alternative if you uh prefer if you are if you're unsure of the cartridges that are around your area if they're pricey like here in illinois cartridges can go for half grams gold for like 60 and a full gram would go for like 80 to 120 you know and that's before taxes the these or maybe you're around an area where all you see sketchy carts are unsure cars that you're just unsure of you know in that case this is better delta a thc is federally legal and legal in most states they'll ship to you and it's just uh something pretty nice to check out if you're like maybe trying to switch up or like you know trying to want something uh reliable something something that trustworthy but more trustworthy than sketchy cards but yeah this is dave connection this is the herb delta athd cartridges and i hope you guys have a great day peace", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in the bathroom man that [ __ ] was [ __ ] had me

there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "1odTaRYhy-E": "okay what is going on [Music] people of earth my name is chilly back at you with another day pass video and in today's video we're gonna be talking about something super fun today we are going to be comparing delta eight versus delta nine and decide really who wants it more and which one is actually better [Music] okay so we're gonna be smoking a little bit of delta 9 yet egg um got a little bit of bud we're going to get you a little shot here is the bud that i'm smoking on today it is literally nothing special there we go nothing crazy nothing crazy at all and we got ourselves a new bowl boys the other one broke alright that bowl this is the new bowl so that way i don't break it rubber and then you just pop this out to clean it uh yeah so if you are new here remember to like comment subscribe all that good youtube [ __ ] if you guys do not know you won't know i'm on twitch twitch.tv slash chillydilly link in the description as always now let's grind this weed up and actually get into the [ __ ] video eh okay so i wanted to take the time to compare the two of delta delta nine really sit down think about it think about the points and think about this argument okay so delta a being on the rise and with this still being legal right now with you being able to buy it online with all that stuff more people are getting into it and you have two halves of a crowd one saying i don't get high and one thing i get high as [ __ ] if you check out my delta 8 uh negative video you can just go through the comments and you can find people arguing for days about how it gets them high and some people it doesn't uh anyway let's get into our first point okay anxiety all right so i think we both know you know if you've smoked delta nine we both know me you everybody watching this video that regularly smokes sale tonight we've all smoked a strain of delta nine that has made us paranoid as [ __ ] you know what i mean it could just be a certain strain bro smoke it next thing you know you're [ __ ] geeking out um it's not the best we have saved the best for last this is our favorite we played it before before the police officer who himself calls 9-1-1 after he and his wife decided to unwind one evening by mixing up a batch of pot brownies here are the best parts bon appetit i think i'm having an overdose of this my wife okay you and your wife yes overnose of what marijuana i think we're dying how much did you guys have uh i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead i really do time is going by really really really really slow did you guys do this on a regular basis no this is the first time that we've ever done it you've never done marijuana before par yeah i have you've never had this reaction to it before ever let's just go on the redwings game what what's the score in the red wings game i'm getting uncool i don't watch the runway i don't know you just you know what i mean i make you uh question your life decisions and yeah pretty much it can be a bad time you know what i mean but with delta eight it's the opposite uh it's meant to be less pair like it takes away the psychoactive effect so you're supposed to not be paranoid you're not supposed to have anxiety so yes well for the most part with delta 9 you don't really get anxious every experience that i've had with delta 8 i didn't have any anxiety at all not one bit i felt just fine honestly all right let's pack a bowl boys let me know what you guys are smoking on dab on eating on anything you're doing to ingest the lovely thc cheers boys oh yeah man that shit's good that's the good [ __ ] let's hear it again boys cheers that's rough okay so pretty much i'm gonna say most people have smoked up tonight dozen nine got anxious paranoid most people delta it's the exact opposite so we're gonna have to get this point to delta eight okay now for the next one this is a pretty controversial topic i feel like um you know and all of this really is when you think about it because you're gonna have groups of people that are like oh it doesn't make me paranoid and then groups that say that it does you know what i mean the next one price you like that the price anyway so the price right so this is gonna be a hard one to really even discuss about but i'm gonna throw in all the variables for the most part so i live in a legal state an illegal state so i don't have medical marijuana i don't have recreational marijuana um i buy it i get it when i get it that's it like a lot of people that watch my videos you know what i mean so for the most part i know there are people out there paying 20 a [ __ ] g which is crazy my boys don't don't just don't just smoke delta just try it at that point and then you got people that live in like colorado and they're paying [ __ ] 130 for an ounce of some [ __ ] that you were paying 20 a g for so with that said i think for the most part especially in legal states but is cheap i mean it's pretty cheap you can buy an ounce cheap you got mid shelf top shelf all that good [ __ ] pretty cheap even uh you know people that i know get it cheap i find it cheap in most areas you know what i mean um but delta eight is pretty consistent about the price now you'll find people in my videos that post links to delta eight cards that are ten dollars i don't know about those websites i don't really trust anything that's ten dollars when other people are selling it for 35. maybe that's a dumb thing on my part but like i just think okay you get what you pay for you get what you put you know what i mean like be careful what you play in your body that's all i'm saying okay i'm gonna buy these shady ten dollar cards so for the most part delta eight because you can't really buy the bud because there's no really bud um you can it's just cbd with delta like sprayed on it but that's we'll get to that later anyway those a cards can vary really anywhere from like 25 to 50 bucks to you know 35 40. the gummies are about 25 to 35. uh i'm honestly gonna have to give it to delta nine on this because in most places delta nine is cheaper than delta eight now i understand that people pay that price especially in illegal states because it's legal and they can get it and then they know it's going to work so i'm still going to have to give it to delta 9 on this just because i feel like really at the end of the day delta 9 is cheaper another thing the higher [Music] okay so once again i know this is going to be a very controversial topic hold on let's hit the ball boys cheers we're gonna have to pack that again i know this is gonna be another controversial topic just because once again it's really all up to the person but i think uh you know what i mean if you agree with me on some of these points please let me know so that way it adds to you know you know what i'm saying anyway uh the high so in my experience and most people's experience of smoking delta a they do get high but it's not as long lasting now that is also based on you and i imagine your tolerance and how delta a or delta 9 reacts to your body but delta 8 high definitely lasts shorter whereas cell 29 you know what i mean you smoking eight blunt or something and you're [ __ ] hot for a hot minute you eat a couple edibles you're hot for a hot minute you know what i mean uh with delta eight it doesn't last as long in my personal experience at least um and even comparing like delta a edibles and delta nine edibles well first of all just be careful with edibles i'm honestly thinking about making a video of the true dangers of edibles and how [ __ ] crazy they can be let's uh 10 likes 10 likes and i will do that okay so the delta edibles compared to the delta 9 uh felt a little stronger but only in the aspect of they made me lazier whereas the delta nine edibles made uh more of a tripping experience more psychoactive so i enjoyed it more because you know when you smoke delta nine like a part of you knows that's what you're going for so i'm gonna have to give the high to delta nine okay so right now we got delta a1 delta nine two okay and another point that i wanna make that honestly this is a no-brainer um speaking of a lot of these that kind of go hand in hand is uh the legal situation so obviously we're gonna have to give that up to delta eight right away just because it's more legal and others like it's just more legal anywhere than delta nine so the option of getting it in hand and buying it online is so much easier so i think that's really a no-brainer um i don't even know why i really added it i really just wanted them to be like neck and neck because it makes it two and two okay so anxiety delta eight one the high delta nine one price delta nine one and then this one i mean it's i know i know you're like that's a no-brainer but you gotta throw that in there because a lot of people that watch wetube or watch my content especially a lot of them don't live in legal states so like this makes it easier for these people so for the last one the one that is really going to make the difference the one that's going to make them one of these two win okay so it's neck and neck right now and yes the last final item on the list is the product [Music] yes i know that's once again you're probably thinking what they're like look you got to think about the product itself you got to think about delta 8 how long it's been out how it's made right now it's still almost being like it's almost new now at this point being made because they're putting it in carts and they're not really doing much with the edibles to be honest like they have some cool stuff sour candies whatnot but they're not making gourmet food they're not making chocolate they're not making all kinds of stuff that delta nines already been making um hold on before we get more into this cheers boys okay so delta a really you you can't even buy deltae but you can buy cbd bud that has delta eight sprayed on it now i understand that you know what i mean but like delta nine off rick that's the first thing people think of is weed but okay okay well let's talk about the cards right seems like delta it's really like trying to push the cart situation especially with how big it is right now but guess who still wins that delta nine because delta knight has already been make doing this and they're going so many steps further to make sure that people don't buy fake cards so they're adding their own unique thing to it they're their own brand like they even had batteries designed just for that brand so they're already winning by having so much more options whereas delta i feel like is in its infancy stage of just making these products so it could get bigger and it could get better but you can buy delta wax i'm pretty sure yeah so like they have that but guess what delta 9 has so many other forms that gets you high higher higher you know what i'm saying speaking of getting higher let's smoke you both i didn't know i could do that uh so yeah man gonna have to give it to delta nine on that one they do win just the product alone it's better better everything about it so the final score three delta nine two delta a now if you guys have enjoyed this video let me know in the comments below if you have made it this far i appreciate it so much remember to subscribe for all the new videos if you guys enjoyed it i hope you did i hope you guys with me much love guys be safe i will see you guys in the next video okay", "X5tMiybynP4": "what's up guys today we're going to show you how to make thc infused oil we used about 19 different pucks from 3.5 and 7 gram bags first let's add 50 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker throw it on your hot plate and turn it up to 120 degrees fahrenheit you're gonna want to let your pucks cook for about five minutes to seven minutes at most extract each puck individually and strain it by squeezing it to release any of the liquid that could be trapped inside you're going to want to repeat these steps until you run out of pucks [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] next we're gonna start the d card process turn your plate up to 240 degrees fahrenheit you're going to want to continue cooking your oil until you don't see any more bubbles rise up to the top don't panic if your oil darkens it just means that the d card process is working for our final step take a nug smasher 37 micron bag and strain your oil through the bag and into a clean beaker [Music] drop a comment below and let us know what you're going to make with your infused mct oil hey guys make sure you check us out at nugsmasher.com

"why does that Kenna Pham and welcome to another product review video so check it out guys for this video I'm gonna be tried here this is the chemstar by phantom farms one gram cartridge alright this is a co2 distillate mix they mixed it whatever this they mixed it okay anyway so this is again a co2 distillate mix one gram cartridge okay normal 510 thread so they fit pretty much every standard battery out there and this is again the chem star and opens up it says hello well hello meet your shiny new cartridge alright hey they ever need me for advertising anyway so check it out this is coming in at 81 point eight percent THC no CBD and two point nine percent on the terpenes okay so not super Turkey but but should be a good hi alright so let's open these up these are very easy and discreet okay so if you're somebody that is on the go a lot you travel a lot maybe you like to go see nature just get out of the house do stuff and you need your medicine you want to smoke whatever

button there and we're gonna go ahead and try to so this is the chem star so um my thoughts I like this product okay I like phantom farms just because they're an affordable reliable company okay they runs me about $35 or so recreationally for this gram and I really like okay very affordable get you high the cartridge that they use is one of my favorite I kind of tend to go for this style of cartridge no matter what company I'm getting okay doesn't doesn't necessarily have to be phantom farms okay I tend to gravitate towards this style of cartridge just because this style of cartridge here gives a nice hit as you guys just saw it gives you like a full-on like you're taking a real dab you know what I mean and that's what I look for in these type of a pens I don't like those little puny nothing cloud whatever hits okay if your vape pen does that it's [ __ ] that's [ __ ] don't argue with me anyway we want a massive dab we want that cloud okay so this is the kind of cartridge I'd go for and I like it I mean obviously you can tell look very nice that here let me look at that very nice product ooh sexy very vibrant color I like it I like it a lot okay so it hits well it's got a nice high to it I'll hit it again here we go I do the double click maybe three times it is a bit of a coffered I don't know why but cartridges always make me call my [ __ ] ass off like worse than dabs worse than anything okay I coughed okay I got one of those people that will try to hide it like a lot of other cannabis entertainers okay who try to hide the fact that they coughed oh I got iron lungs no no no I coughed okay this [ __ ] makes me cough hopefully one day it won't be like that but for right now I'm a cop okay um so it's gonna make you coughing a little bit it's not the super smoothness that I've ever had but it's definitely you know overall good I love that I love that it's 80 some odd percent THC because that's where it should be especially for these kind of cards as the high 80s I love that it's $35 for this gram recreational medical you're gonna get it cheaper I love almost everything about it I think it's a very nice product in my opinion so if you've ever had fan of all work really quick rating rating we got to give this a rating hold on lemme hold on you don't get too much of the chem taste though I just kind of noticed that I was like this is chemstar it's gonna have some cabinet that diesel that kind of gas and I don't really get that too much I don't really taste that too much so that's a little bit disappointing this is a hybrid and tastes alright it's not too much of a taste to it a little faint like a nice earthy get a little bit tinge of like a gassy taste but not really like a not really like a diesel it's more like a cookie gas almost I want to say something like that you know what I mean almost like a Durbin poison gas almost I don't know exactly what it is that makes the chemstar but you know that's what the flavor I get when I hit this get like an earthy a little bit of gassy taste to it and it's nice it's not super pungent it's not super mouth-watering but it's nice it's nice overall so this product right here definitely gets a thumbs up from me all right I would recommend this if you were somebody that's on a budget or if you're somebody that just doesn't want to spend a whole lot because hey there are those people too they just don't want to spend an arm and a leg on the best hash rasen carts that are eighty hundred dollar you know whatever just find yourself a good cart that works for you that's gonna fit everything that you want and for me phantom farms does a good job okay I love phantom farms they get a thumbs up for this product and let me know your thoughts and opinions about the chemstar in the

oh thanks Trey damn [ __ ] go hey all we salad clowns around it look like", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in

back and see some more we'll see you later thanks tune in this been John with CNC connoisseurs peace", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things

an insane amount so if anyone of you have experience with this company real or fake let me know let me know how it looks different from yours whether you think you think or know for a fact that yours is real it does have lab results I scanned it it brought me to the raw garden website except one thing one one little discrepancy I noticed the batch number I typed it in and it was for a different string it was not dojo cush but and then I typed in dojo Kush and I looked for the one gram one and it was like a two V two to three or something so I don't know if it was a typo that's mad weird what if it was fake why would they even put in the effort of putting a batch number that was two away from the real number why not just put the real number many questions you can pause that it and read that if you want to manufactured bang bang Best Buy bang 21 we're good ingredients you can let me try to get it you can pause that right there if you'd like to read that let's see Oh God a lot of

can probably tell I'll get comments like bro your plug was hitting your [ __ ] it's like I I have to I have to hit it to review it some just some I hit a lot some I do not hit a lot but I've been decent I don't have any weird feelings about the cart itself even if it is fake I believe and normally live what's called raw Gardens usually clearer than most carts and that this is it looks more yellow on camera but this is clearer than most carts I've seen recently see if we can't get a nice like this so I think this I think this is legit it tastes very clean bro when I when I got this and I was like just named my car and like I left the room and came back and it like smell like weed so I thought that was kind of a good a good sign like it smells good and tastes good it tastes like tastes like bud has like a little bit of lemony I mean yes to it I would maybe if you if you're going to grab these I would definitely just scan it on the spot before you even grab it just scan that [ __ ] see if it brings you to a legit to the right and then you search up the batch make sure it brings up to the right batch you don't want to be smoking Bunco you need to stay safe especially now our lungs are particularly yeah at risk at the moment so make sure you're taking care of your lungs I am probably not gonna smoke any more of this just to stay safe but hope you guys enjoyed if you like

set up a scheduling Ford but this truly was an impromptu and as such I am gonna have to get a couple things in line before I do this since this is a high-quality distillate granted it was cheap but that's just because it was inexpensive the quality on this is actually pretty on point and the distillate itself is actually pretty thick if you do not heat it up it will not flow well at all that being said I need to bring your heater over here and set up right here taking about one minute so if you guys got a minute there just grabbed a pipe grab a lighter pearl the [ __ ] you doing Phil common in the comment right there miss Foley I'm glad to have you here myself thank you so much and I will be right here [Music] like nothin ever happened right got here here turn a little bit so the

real quick and she can sit down and enthused you just a second while I go take care of cleaning my [ __ ] tip because the oil is [ __ ] thick because I just did that video did everybody see that videos that I put out um I still hope that it helped some people out I thought it was really helpful if I'd have seen it whenever I was first refilling some cartridges whenever one went out and I just broke to some bits trying to get it apart instead of actually figuring out how the [ __ ] it works and come on push hard okay so Cassie's here everybody ready to say hi Cassie I'm from back here I just all you guys get to do is see the smoke nothing else I need abs and a tool and a lid I [ __ ] is hotter she just won one hot [ __ ] air like a [ __ ] right I know this is taking a long time to Marty fifteen minutes into it I'm sorry guys I know this is taking forever I apologize completely uh Emma you guys do over from the UK you guys tuned in at all I know this probably like tonight or some [ __ ] for you guys but that being said what we're going to do we are going to I'm cleaning out this goddamn thing I use it I use it to make that video and it got all gummed up if you guys don't clean your equipment in between uses it tends to gum up and it works like [ __ ] so please God don't do what I do and [ __ ] clean your goddamn equipment just clean your equipment not hard now I've lost a lot of people that's amazing I did that I did that live about three weeks ago yeah I do that I smoked the wedding cake I smoked the wedding cake cartridge in one sitting with my wife we sat down and we smoked it back and forth with a nitro collector using a dab cap it was uh it was brilliant it was absolutely brilliant okay now that this tip is clean I will be utilizing the built-in syringe that is used in these who filled these cartridges with it okay first things first I do have a custom cartridge stand um but I also have a couple different methods this is about the easiest one that I've come up with if you happen to find one of these laying around it's for 9-millimeter casings all right four nine millimeter but everybody nine millimeter this is what they come in these goddamn things they just they stand up and they're just [ __ ] so perfect they just fit right in there and they just stand up so [ __ ] good they don't [ __ ] fall out or nothing they don't [ __ ] fall out [ __ ] perfect [ __ ] yeah fell out thing cause I dropped with some of this but yeah you press them in there it's the [ __ ] works very very good very good okay now a tip like this and a syringe hover glass one can be found at Bay Park mark which is where I get all my bait supplies from and they are in the link in the description below bay parts marcom as well if you would like to improve the quality of the show or help contribute in any way check out the link down there for the patreon of double tears feel free to check them out no obligation but there are some wonderful prizes available as well that being said the first thing you do whenever you've got a cartridge you're trying to fill you unscrew the lid unscrew the lid a monster lid on each of these because I got 2 grams to fill so uh that's what I'm gonna be filling this is the distillate that we're gonna be using this one is the strawberry lemon-aid what I'm doing is I'm scoring up the top of this one because this one's the strawberry lemon-aid so when I open this one the mango and I mix them up because I'm [ __ ] stoned I'll know which one is which is there a better way of course there's a better way I just chewed on the [ __ ] thing yeah I could have got a marker and written on it if I wasn't a [ __ ] idiot but hashtag not a [ __ ] idiot you know what do you do this one as you can see this one is undamaged now I can mix them up readily and be like okay I know which is which always stinking always thinking now the mango flavored works out for total cannabinoids of 87 with a total THC of 73 the strawberry lemonade works off with the total cannabinoids of 87.9 a simple point to increase which is minimal and does not affect anything in my opinion with an actual THC total of seventy seven point three the seventy-three point two and the seventy seven point three that's about four percent that that can affect a little bit but when you're dealing with numbers this large if you're smoking hip and you're smoking weed that's got four percent THC there is a difference there but if you're smoking seventy three percent THC and seventy seven percent THC well you're smoking THC so they said as you can see these are come in and syringe with a threaded section there specifically to put a tip on it whenever it is nice and warm however if you can see there's a bubble in there and it's all graduated but I'm gonna do this is the chewed-up one this one has a bubble in there can you see that bubble in there it's on the bottom all right I'm gonna set this one up right here so you guys can watch and see if the bubble does rise up in that one which it won't it's it's pretty high-quality distally I rocket ition grot rocket ushion that's hard to say Joe are you doing my friend nice to see you how's it going thank you for joining my channel my friend what I do here is I spread a little bit of knowledge concerning the lovely world of cannabis and cannabis extracts right now what we're doing is I'm refilling I am filling two new cartridges these cartridges can be bought at bay parts marcom in the bottom with some distillate some THC distillate as you can see that bubble hasn't [ __ ] moved yet that I picked up for grand total I do is 12 and a half dollars give or take 10 or 15 cents twelve and a half dollars give or take ten or fifteen cents for the gram of distillate these are 77 percent THC and seventy-three percent THC we're really putting them into a cartridge we're gonna do the mango on the right and the strawberry are on the left I know this is cross corner of you guys but whatever like I said these are relatively thick and uh it needs to be heated up a little bit just to be able to flow you know not an overly a substantial amount but definitely a little bit definitely a little bit I have a heater over here that I'm using and one of the first things I do because I'm weird and I don't know if this really helps but this is the way I do it like my shirt oh gee cush Platinum boy I ran shadow what's up everybody boos Magoo man how you doing again again again all right so here it is I remove the little plastic cap that just screws on the screws off whoop take that off that is a plug that doesn't actually excrete anything you want to get rid of that [ __ ] this is completely useless much like tints on a rock you don't need any any tits on a rock and this isn't very good what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna want to utilize the tip that's using doing that why don't I do that just yet one of you first first and foremost I actually draw some air into the cartridge directly from in front of the heater this is some superficial [ __ ] at best but in my dumbass mind I think if I draw a warm air into it it will heat it up faster because you're a [ __ ] idiot we're total check out me I don't know so first thing I do is I draw some air into it and then I set it in front of that heater and just let it rotate I let it rotate right where my fingers are so that cylinder gets no harder than my fingertips now my fingertips can take a decent amount of heat but nowhere near what it would take to in any way compromise the plastic or the oil in that in that syringe so I'm not worried about burning it any more than I'm worried about actually burning my hands you know I'm saying my fingertips are pretty tough from smoking roaches and all that but when it comes down to it I'm not gonna let myself get burnt just holding this so that's how I basically keep it from getting overly warm possibly compromising there's the syringe in any way so this is actually pretty warm right here right now it's starting to flow I just see it's starting to flow down from the top just a little bit on the side there see you leveling out okay yeah now see you're starting to flow a little bit see that's that's how I do it as a heater some people will use a lighter or a torch or whatever the [ __ ] and that works out if your syringe is glass basically kind of use whatever the [ __ ] you want if your syringe is glass this this syringe is not glass for glass refilling syringes of high quality with the tip available a tip like this that will work in almost any cartridge they are available at the link in the description bate part smart comm that is vape part smart comm feel free to go check them out if you do use the link in the description I will get a little stipend of that and it is grateful for the channel to get that it's very grateful to you what the [ __ ] ever it's all he misses all words okay as you can see now this stuff is flowing a little bit kind of like like a little bit better you know what I'm saying oh yeah nice and warm that's what I do right before I do those refilling videos whenever you see me snap and come into picture I just brought it in from the heater so it's working it's working perfect so I I attached this tip to it just like this it goes in does a quarter turn boom it's on there it's on there I like to laid it down like this and then push some air out just so that it's in the top okay right there you've got your grab you've got your [ __ ] system right here you put your system into your system right like that and then you begin to dispense it and since it is warm it should have been so you come out pretty decent alright okay there we go that is topped off pull your cirrage out and you have a little area right there you see that where the oil needs to still get down in there but as you can see it is slowly moving in that area so it will flow right into there this cartridge itself is a little bit cool compared to the oil that I just pushed into it so as of right now that bubble isn't going to move I'm gonna have to heat it back up a little bit and all that good stuff but that's that's neither here nor there that's the way that one is so you can just touch this with a little bit of the tip there and you can see it's straight out like that the distillate is it's very thick [ __ ] it's like marshmallow [ __ ] fluff now simply take your lid place it right over that and screw it down once you've got it caught a little bit pull it out of your cartridge holder and there you have it there you see it has flowed a little bit down very little left as it goes into that area um this will be heated up and we'll give it about give it about a half an hour get it all nice and warm I'll use the heater again whenever I do it but this is just an example get it all nice and warm again and uh give it about a half an hour some people say five minutes some people say ten minutes some people are idiots so uh I'm gonna give it like I said thirty minutes before I even try to hit that day hit that bad thing so my wife came out and took the pin that I was choosing to smoke with um so what that comes down to is I'm gonna do another big dab here since I don't have my pin now those of you who've been watching from the beginning here's that bubble um if you're looking at the graduations you can see that bubble has moved approximately 2/10 of a mil in in the 20 minutes that we've been talking so we'll set that down right there and we'll keep that little experiment going okay now what I need to remember is that this cartridge right here is the mango first card I filled up is the mango will set it off to this side since it's on the right and this one's on the left we'll do that now I have this box sitting here viola I don't remember who I was speaking with on one of my lives but they said something about Humboldt County and I said uh Humboldt County hell yeah and I looked at this thinking that this possibly came from the Humboldt County area and for the life of me I think that it does but I'm not so sure now because the little exclamation point with the cannabis thing doesn't have a CA on it you know what I'm saying that doesn't have a CA on it now this says that this was done by rose any labs the testing lab is Rose City labs all testing data on those dates this was picked up when I went down to California and I think it was picked up in Northern California this stuff is absolutely amazing absolutely amazing one of the nicest concentrates I have ever smoked and I have smoked a fair amount of [ __ ] dope I'm just saying okay and this these guys right here I don't know if every single batch is as good as this but this [ __ ] live resin banana split this was on point like a point on the point you know what I'm saying like crazy crazy nice I'm gonna leave that right there just because they deserve a little bit of attention for what they're putting out that being said I'm gonna read a little bit I guess I don't know if that's what they call liquid marijuana or now but this is straight-up butane extracted hash oil that I'm smoking on right here and the liquid marijuana or the distillate that I've got right here is an oil and what that's done is they use a short path distillate by the way if you would like to expand your knowledge on the entire process about cannabis and the extraction process feel free to Google short path cannabis distillation it's very easy hit the Google microphone repeat the words short path cannabis distillation and they will show you a couple videos and a couple articles concerning the short path distillation process what it is is you take your extract which is generally any kind of cannabis extracted anything basically put it into a [ __ ] thing heat it up it eventually vaporizes it all be prized at different temperatures as it vaporizes it goes through a condensation tube and then it goes through some [ __ ] and then it just eventually um condenses into a bulb different temperatures you release different Turf and different molecules of the cannabis plant some people have five seven or three different chambers some go up one chamber and what you do is you just let it off gas until you hit your optimal temperature put the tube in collect it as it condenses in you will get your heavies which is the THC crystalline and depending on your process depending on how good you are at it depends on the purity of it it is it is what it is it's very intriguing it's very invigorating whenever you watch it and you think about it you're like holy [ __ ] really and that's basically how lots of things are condensed in a distillation process it's very very very very nice I'll do a video on it eventually when I have a little bit more hands-on knowledge I love the theory of it and I can explain the theory of it but when it all comes down to it without any actual hands-on knowledge like well what happens when you do this I [ __ ] really don't feel comfortable talking to you about a whole lot about it because I don't feel informed enough about it myself that makes sense fuckin'-a man all right here we go we're doing another dab on the damage right here this is some a in cream you know I don't even like saying that I don't like saying that at all [Music] so this is some crumble that we got from Black Diamond extracts they do decent job nine dollars and ten cents is what paid for this out the door nine dollars and ten cents out the door after taxes and discounts I'm pretty happy with it it's about a 70 percent THC wax they call it a crumple this one here is a wax cheers folks that's pretty good there is a little bit of harshness about it I mean you know it is a nine dollar crown you know not normally this is on sale but still need to understand that some companies do better work than others some companies have higher standards than others that's what it comes down to and some companies do a better job than others you're like hey man how can you get a decent concentrate for $9 a great deal how well there's a couple ways there's a couple ways sorry about that as you can see that bubble is almost 3/4 of the way up it has been about 35 minutes but that's the limits in there for 20 minutes I'm not gonna bow too much it but uh there you I'm pretty happy with the distillate though um yeah I actually don't like blunts at all let's have tobacco in them and I used to smoke cigarettes and now I can't I can't have any [ __ ] tobacco at all it's [ __ ] it's pretty lame it just it really it tastes bad to me and I'm not one of those guys that's like oh you smoke cigarettes well you should suck a dick no man you're a smoke cigarette smoke cigarettes I mean it's not like you don't know what's gonna kill you [ __ ] everybody's been telling [ __ ] everybody for [ __ ] decades and it's gonna [ __ ] kill you but everybody [ __ ] knows that's gonna kill you they did those commercials with the Marlboro Man and all that [ __ ] everybody knows I'm not [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] it's gonna kill you it's gonna key it's getting cait's gonna kill you my grandmother smoked for like 60 [ __ ] years she's lived to be 93 goddamn years old and she didn't die from cancer okay I'm just saying I'm not anti smoking I don't smoke I don't like I don't like how heavy it makes my chest I'm up I'm a pissy [ __ ] sorry coughing so art that's one of it that's a $9 gram okay see you got a little bit more [ __ ] on your chest you know you got a little bit more heavies in the in the hit it's not as pure it's not as it's not as nice that's why you pay three or four dollars more for your gram and then the upgrade just a little bit that's just that's that's what I'm saying folks just just that you know gingersnaps I'm having a decent day indeed indeed indeed I haven't had a good day in a long time I got four kids no I'm just kidding no never great day having a great day do a little bit of a live here I normally don't do anything on Sunday you know so I figured I'd pop on here got a friend of mine over and they wanted some distillate cartridges they're like man I really don't like paying the amount of money that they want for some distillate garbages I says you know what I got some cartridges here they're decent you know run over here we'll go down we'll go down by some really nice distillate at a decent price and uh I'll throw it into some cartridges for you I mean you're gonna have some decent babe cartridges at a decent price you know well it works out pretty good and it does you know even even if you were forced to buy these you know even if you were forced to buy these cars are just you know you go down you buy ten or something [ __ ] them you know you can generally get a decent cartridge a good I recommend going with good see sells you can use them two or three times and that cuts the price by a third but you get a good see sell cartridges if you only want one or two they can be about five bucks and that's that is what it is you know you get what you're paying for you can save money and buy cheaper cartridges if you want to save money by cheaper cartridges you could have a failure or they could not draw as well or I don't anything anyway you pick these up for about three or four bucks apiece right then you pick up this grandma distillate you know I got this gram discipline like I said I got it for $12 $12.50 you ever taste somewhere in there so you add that to the $3.00 you pay for this 15 bucks for a full one gram cartridge out the door you know whereas normally if I were to go down to buy a cartridge a decent cartridge even a cartridge from the guys that make this oil they still want eighteen to twenty dollars for a cartridge so you're paying six eight bucks just for that cartridge generally if you buy it in that manner then I just I don't need to do that I don't recommend doing that if you can get around doing that then do it as you can see now this is the same Boyle where that bubble didn't move at all I've been holding in front of the heater and as you didn't see that bubbles moving just fine now I'm gonna heat it up a little bit more and then I'll settle down and then I'll push all the air out then I'll load up this other cartridge and I'll let you guys get back to your day I do appreciate you guys joining in thank you so much it really means a lot to me and uh why I said if this helps you out or if you give a [ __ ] at all go ahead give a like on that thumbs up button down there and if you'd like to help contribute to the channel feel free to click the patreon link in the description and go check out some of my tears see if any of those rewards work for you I would appreciate it helps me out all right that being said we're drawing a little bit and then push out a little bit all right there we go once again we stick it all the way in to the bottom start to dispense the oil all right now do what there's a little bit all right so that being said and done so this is on the left this is the strawberry lemon-aid right here and this one on the right is the mango as you can see there's still a little bit of an air bubble right in there on that mango because I still haven't warmed up this cartridge it means II wind up let it sit in there whenever you've got some real good distillate you always want to do that whenever you see me doing my videos a lot of people like dude your videos three seconds long you take pure distillate you open it up you put in a cartridge then you start hitting it in [ __ ] thirty seconds dude there's a lot of cutting and pasting that happens there [ __ ] and my dumb ass standing in front of a heater for a minute while the [ __ ] cameras going going [ __ ] wildest goddamn [ __ ] feel better cuz I didn't heat it up enough that's why cuz I didn't heat it up okay um so yeah you don't see that all the time but all right at the base of each one of these mouthpieces there's a little silicone o-ring right there I'll make sure that squeezes out just enough to be completely flush with the outside so it's absolutely perfect um this right here with a little bit of an air bubble in it is the mangle and this one here is not as their differences but the mango is a little tiny bit lighter maybe a little bit tiny bit lighter maybe but that being said the mangos on the outside strawberry lemonade's one inch from the outside it's for my own benefit here you have it Oh Phillip a couple cartridges with a little bit discipline Oh hope you guys might be able to get a little bit of use out of that you know um I know it's not not everybody's gig but it's exactly what I do and uh it's how I make [ __ ] roll a lot easier and a lot smoother for me now I have got all of this done for approximately twenty-five dollars to one gram cartridges full of seventy seven percent THC distillate where the bubble don't [ __ ] move at all at all at all for a total of $25 $25 so you know for me this is the ideal way to do it okay you get a hundred bucks together you go down you buy [ __ ] what 9 grams of distillate you know if you've got a good C cell cartridge you pay five bucks down right now and you can use that three times you can fill that [ __ ] up three different times I can do it I try to do them never more than four but I never tell people more than three they've got a very good failure rating and that failure rating doubles or triples every time you reuse that but it's so low it doesn't even get to 1% by the time you're using it four times that's that's that's math anyway um maybe some reading real quick Daniels dude [ __ ] I'm a stretch to spit out some fold eyes I'm gonna [ __ ] just kidding I'm gonna do it dad's then we need the [ __ ] out of Dodge don't you worry about it we'll try to each phone in line what's the difference receiving Ewing oil and that stuff well here we go the difference between CBD oil and this stuff is to be exact this is oil if you look at these little numbers on the back the actual CBD that this has is 0.4% CBD all of these have a completely different THC v CBL CBC CBD CBN all these are different properties and molecules and components components of the cannabis plant each one of these components of the cannabis plant activates or utilize the different neuron or part of your brain to do [ __ ] you understand what I'm saying some of these are for nausea some of them are for making your [ __ ] pucker some more forget you [ __ ] high someone for me to get high longer okay that's just a scientific and I can get into that if you want to but that's a completely different video the main difference between lists in CBD oil I can buy this exact same package with a different flavor from a different plan that is 70% CBD in almost zero THD that's the difference they come from different plants therefore they extract a different material and that way this is a strike THC that they would attract CBD and that's the way that works very very baseline is that better you guys could have told me to [ __ ] turn that heater off and any [ __ ] kind and I don't listen to you fool it's just like right here anyway [ __ ] it's quiet now let's do a DAB somebody out there is running chainsaw leaves goddamn Christmas time one month while the [ __ ] eejits all right so here we go we're dabbing on some alien cream I still don't like the name of that right hey you should with some an alien cream in your [ __ ] rig right Wow really really that doesn't sound good at all I don't I don't know I don't like that but it doesn't sound enjoyable dude all are tasting an alien cream no no I have not I have not you can there's no videos or pictures I swear no alien cream for me all right so here we go we're into a bit of a Dingle donger dab here we're gonna say right well I appreciate that by the way come people ask why the [ __ ] should we give you anything on patreon mainly people that I know that don't watch my videos like [ __ ] enum to give you [ __ ] anything so I was like well you know what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make my livestream you better I'm trying to get platform I'm trying to increase the microphone and increase the camera strength so that you can get a better start of what I'm doing here I would love to get a little bit higher quality video camera I'd love to get a desktop for the garage a desktop computer that I could run some the webcam and thing I could use an alternate alternate payment system other than YouTube super chat which they took for me because I'm so bad to in that situation and we can become more interactive we can interact more in an interactive way I think you go boo boo whenever I get a comment root loop and you know you could do that hey I'm gonna make my comment look like my wife's comment because uh I like her so thank you so much effort I appreciate it greatly man but uh go ahead and check it out this is really nice

tonight well I definitely am hopefully you are too you for watching this [Music] really push down hard no idea teeth at the end oh yeah look at a huge piece of right too yeah this syringes nearing the end very subtle but definitely like it's subtle but you know it's gonna be strong because I subtle with a strong aftertaste he know is gonna be good holy [ __ ] this reminds me of like that Seattle Waterstone syringe oil that you could just make edibles with put into your butter just like same kind of deal but I bet this that was only eighty-one percent THC yeah well I definitely believe I've done a statistically significant amount on camera where did I put the cap would want to put the cap on before putting this back in my pocket [ __ ] it leave it in the bag for now yeah and I could feel myself getting a little higher from the efforts from before so this is going to be a hell of a ride I'm hoping I'm hoping I got like 500 milligrams out of that like THC at least", "dpXka4y27u4":

doghouse i just copped another one because i [ __ ] with darth hugs and i was like why not drop a video and then you for me so i was like yeah get a couple see what let me tell you how it should taste and everything i had two i had um chocolate choppy candy cookies and um straw guava those are the two i had but the straw guava broke on me like literally the day i bought it in the lemon mac i mean in the tropicana cookies i finished it but yeah this is 11 macro here 89 87 percent thc and then total is 89. so i think the rest is just cbd then but yeah i've been smacking on it a little bit and i'm not gonna lie to y'all this might be my favorite flavor so far bro like i [ __ ] with this heavy rare i'm not gonna lie to y'all like there's just the flavor on this is different like it's different bro like y'all don't understand and [ __ ] with this let me tell you what that tastes like all right let me point and by the way somebody asked me if i'm easy to use bro yeah i use it with battery she's been through a lot literally you can change the temp down here bro this is like one of the best batteries you could get out there bro drop this [ __ ] in water like a million times [ __ ] not three times and it still works still rips but yeah as i was saying i'm gonna tell y'all what it tastes like i'm gonna put my [ __ ] up so literally when you first inhale at first you taste nothing then you taste the lemon and then the [ __ ] bud hits you after the lemon like no caffeine it's just like it's just the way it goes the way it just hits you is it's cool bro because at first there's nothing in the limit and then the [ __ ] bud like it just the way it just comes at you bro and if it's your first time watching with the dark heart or if y'all got a dark [ __ ] bro this [ __ ] is cletus for like like in person it should just look so much better one of the best looking cartridges out there damn you see me i don't look faded but i just don't ever look faded because i smoke i think i smoke too much that's probably why but yeah just the like the way the cartridge even looks like the white tip like the design on it bro like it's hard to find another card like this for real this lemon max blowing i'm not gonna lie let me know like if y'all had lemon mac before because i [ __ ] with lemon mac way more than chocolate candy cookies the worst one was probably trouble candy cookies bro if y'all are getting dark [ __ ] i don't recommend i recommend you not to get tropicana cookies like it's smacks and [ __ ] yeah but it's just the flavor is not the best i think lemon mac's the best so far but i've only had lemon mac tropicana cookies and uh strogawatt but yeah look this is a strawberry [ __ ] that's how it broke but now um let me see let me see if i got another story time for you honestly in the last two videos i've been telling like a random story time in the middle of the video and i guess y'all [ __ ] with it but yeah i only think i got a story okay but yeah bro look at the bows on this hey one thing i do want to say though is that i don't know if it's just me but i feel like these go fast like the ways quick you feel me i don't know if i'm tripping on should i take a blinker for the boys or what a blinker for the boys [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] i'll [ __ ] sweetie if y'all didn't take a blinker with me you're sick as [ __ ] no cow bro i even forgot there's two hot bugs in here hold on bro look at that you see all the smooth bro and i've been trying to blow this [ __ ] away but my sister-in-law made me another one of these bro she makes shirts like this and stuff she makes um key chains i mean stuff for your keychains and [ __ ] she makes cuts like design cups and [ __ ] so if y'all want one of these or a shirt for yourself or anything um just comment and uh i'll send you her um insulin [ __ ] so you can hit her up but yeah i need to wear this no cap i'm gonna just throw it over the orange shirt this is my first video with this one on no cap we are sweating bro y'all see me y'all see that little [ __ ] it's too big hey look how big my forehead is yeah that's why i have this color here no cap so that's why yeah that's why that's why i'm attacking if y'all [ __ ] be hanging in the comments call me at taco that's why i broke this i wasn't blessed with the hairline if i was bro trust me i wouldn't be attack watching but yeah damn

"HUKhXQbWbqA": "what's up everybody spoil hitman here I figured I'd do a little review I'll just be my first one that I've really done but we just got done shopping at the new Terrapin station the grand open on Mississippi here in Denver and as we were walking out we ended up seeing the little table for sphere X okay they have a they set up distillate cartridges one of the good things about it is that he were about this that he was shown is it's got five separate holes down at the bottom which allow you to it actually gives you a bigger hit show you right now it's very smooth to hit there's no button to turn it on you just charge it and you just go so the distillates we got today we got a mango Kush vape this is what it looks like the 500 milligram and what it says or what he was saying is that they reintroduced terpenes into it so you get most of the you know a bigger bang for your buck stuff like this the mango cush is a hybrid and as you can tell I'll show you what a big root looks like so this think it's pretty strong it's smooth if you get a chance to check it out it's spheric s-- no button batteries cartridges are easy there's no refill so alright see boy hey man y'all have a good one", "IvXYj77pprk": "so you guys can see by that little package or this little package right here I'm going to show you guys real quick I'm not gonna do a four of you on everything that I got in here just the cartridge alone and I'm gonna put out the vlog for me going to get this stuff in the video that's coming out this Friday so keep on the lookout for that we're starting a new vlog series man we're not gonna be doing I'll be doing cartridges reviews on Mondays and then [ __ ] vlogs on Fridays coming up Friday so mmm first things first men we got well I'll save that for last so first things first we just didn't cup too much stuff but you know it's pretty expensive ice ended up dropping like 120 bucks and we got the sherbert octane number for cookies 8th very nice and I love the packaging and those two unabated some elements because I heard these are the best papers out right now and also I got a grinder just cheap little grinder you know just make sure that everything's crushed up nice and fine and you got the cookies bag right here man infamous cookies bag but we're gonna set that off to the side menu we're gonna get to what you guys really wanted to see so all right here man I'm so excited about I haven't opened this I haven't done anything to I haven't smelt it tasted it this is a first on first impression man the cookies London pound cake right here so we're gonna hop straight into this and while we're smoking I'm gonna be talking because there are some fake products that have been coming out supposedly cookies but this is a real deal man right here I'm gonna show you guys so you get the box out get the box out high flyers get the little thing out getting a little too bright see little cookies logo right there it's a little white tube got a little piece on the bottom holding it together as you guys can see right there London pound cake hopefully there's a verified cookie sticker right there at the back and then right here on the side you got pretty much everything you need to know I'm not sure that's gonna focus up or not right right there should focus at London poundcake total THC eighty point nine no cannabinoids I'm a no CBD and then it was its best by 11 to 19 so yeah toss that huh pull up the cartridge real quick show you guys the oil how it's looking there's a little logo right there cookies logo so they only sleeve a really really small air bubble right there it's really small and then it's filled to the brim which is a plus you know definitely when you want to be when you're spending crazy amounts like this you're gonna want little to no air bubbles so just to show you guys how to cyllage it here's a receipt at cookies right there it's probably not gonna [ __ ] it up but all right there Londyn pound cake let's get it you already know what's up and we're back to the video so let's get to this review man I'm so excited to be trying this [ __ ] set this off to the side if you got it and by the way if you guys like this new little setup right here I got a couch in my my work room so it makes it a lot more easier to make videos in here too so take off the plastic pieces pop the little bottom off has a little cookies engraved right there and then be like Jimmy Jam that dad man dude let me see you [ __ ] get any prominent flavors I'm not talking [ __ ] I'm just saying that's what he does but I don't really get any flavors I'm not sure like if that even works or not but it smells like very very dang let me get my raw garden battery out real quick and then I'm excited yeah I'm over here shaking but so let's get to it boys the cookies sitting nice and flush on the raw garden they actually used the same batteries cookies it's same C cell rebrand m3 and this one is so I'm excited man first impressions right here if you guys are 18 over 21 and over make sure you guys smoking along with I was going to say it hit that like comments up but it's not even that part of the video so go ahead and let me know what you're smoking or some cookies if you guys ever tried real cookies let me know so this is London pound cake in their high flyers cartridge so Cheers whoa there's not what I was expecting that at all who aren't that initial hit was literally straight up like gas like if someone opened a valve a [ __ ] propane just filled my mouth and that was out guess it was mmm whoo that's a very very nice flavor though I'm not gonna lie this is different way different than what I'm used to so bro holy Wow there's lemon pound cake is straight dude like it's literally tastes like gas in that second hey I got gas and mixed in with a little bit of um like orange let me just take another hit I'm gonna put this on the bat my battery it's also just all you do is just screw the bottom on the wrong side screw the bottom on if you guys don't have a battery like the raw garden one can just coo a little very very small and then just rip away a little lights gonna appear here in the bottom yeah dude that the very gassy oh no honey get some water yeah I can't keep coughing like this is too much for the video so so far oh that head changes starting to kick in after three little three to four little hits the head changes definitely starting to come in I barely got a very very small little air bubble coming up right there so that's gonna put a little dent in this and I'm not really feeling this big-ass battery I'm gonna switch it back to the raw garden because I feel like it gives you more flavourful of it and you guys aren't gonna be seen that it was battery in this video because I forgot to charge it my fault my fault I decided to not charge the best battery I could possibly have for right now so oh yeah like I was saying fake cookies cartridges man so some dude for my work if you're watching this bro he told me he's all oh yeah this weekend at a party I picked up with cookies cartridge I was like oh you need to bring this thing to work let me hit that like and then um he told me he told me I remember looking at watching a fake cookies cartridge video and then I asked him I was like a bro like what was the what was the cartridge like like what was the insides like he told me that the insides were plastic they're like it's a little plastic piece that kind you get cheap from very very cheap cartridges that holds it you don't get that little cylinder tube and then the outside is just like all white it's like a really really big all white in blue box and it says cookies on it and it's nothing like the original box like literally nothing like the original box it doesn't say high-fliers it doesn't have fists on the bottom it doesn't have the testing on the bottom and it definitely doesn't have the little certified cookie sticker on the bottom so I was like yeah bro it's kind of I doubt you got a real one but you know whatever's he said he got I'm faded I feel like everyone everything gets everyone no it is you this is like a very very like oh I'm getting that little poundcake taste in the back now maybe I just had to wake up the coil when you hit this a couple more times get that full effect whoo-hoo that that gasps like it lingers in the back of your throat and yeah this is definitely a government I'm kind of I'm very very glad I caught this like it's either you guys could see I spent one hundred and ten dollars 115 dollars on literally just bud and a cartridge but the thing is like the quality of the product that cookies provides is definitely worth it you know like I could get another booth cartridge like a 55 for a full gram and then it's it's gonna get me hot but it's not gonna get me as high as this and the flavor is not going to be as good as this you know things like that and with the raw garden um you know for example raw garden the after text as they come out to like 45 a half to 250 dollars a half so you you like P works that your period of time and why don't you just cover all garden it's similar price it's actually not similar price because you still from raw garden sells to only licensed dispensaries and then licensed dispensaries tax you of so much dude it's insane I don't even want to talk about that she's gonna give me a mint so I'm gonna take another hit off this man where he's gonna keep ripping and see if we get any more flavors and turps you know turps that's actually something we need to point out let's see what the turkeys are about mmm you bet very very chirpy it's not like overpowering like a garden it kinda reminds me of Le cush I'm not gonna live kind of reminds me of them the le cush disel it for sure and but this one this is just like super gassy the Le cush had like more of like a like a I had like a filler you could tell like the last one that I got it tasted like strawberries it's not supposed to taste like strawberries I mean but this I feel like if I were to go out and buy London pound cake right now roll it up in that in some elements rolling papers smokey I'd probably get the same exact taste and this is burners favorite smoke right now he said I think it's London pound cake cereal milk cheetah piss like but those aren't even out yet like cereal milk actually sir I'm oh just drop today I was gonna cop that but when I saw that it was like $70 and 80 I was just like I just I just shift my head but I was just alright never mind I was like give me give me some of that that sherbert octane man yeah all right so we're going it to the review of this video part of the video and the word you keep talking and the video eventually so alright so far I don't like how the freaking oil isn't going up to the top that usually with cartridges they should go up automatically but when there are some cartridges like West Coast care for example it does the same exact thing where the oils somewhat gets stuck and then it's just stuck then you have a big gaping hole right there hopefully that's not the case of this hopefully I just had to keep in here so flavorful mmm um I need a copy London town Kate like the bud a sub that might be the next cup [Laughter] rolled it up in a nice little Jaynes market way up again into the video I mean the review the Terps I would rate them a good seven out of ten it's not to Turkey but the Turks are definitely there you get a nice flavorful tur penis in the back of your throat the flavor wise gasps this is like no other flavor that I've ever tasted I can see why Berner likes London pound cake I never seen anybody else review london pound cake so i'm probably to be one of the first people on youtube at least to say this thing is pretty freakin good man pretty freakin good and then but I do like if I had to describe what the flavor it is I can like I really can't describe it I would have to just say like it's kind of like a gassy taste obviously like the gas you get from wheat but a very very high gassy taste you're not getting too many notes of like fruity things like that you get a very very slight taste of like like Patna pound cake like if you guys ever been to the gas stations and seen those little those little bar bar pound cakes the ones that are really really thick kind of tastes kind of like that and it's good it's a very very subtle though it's not it's not in your face so that's a very upside that it tastes more like weed than it does then it tastes like artificial mists and fillers and things like that and the hi I'm I'm pretty stun I'm Paige stone this isn't my first height of the day and I'm trying to regulate my high right now I'm trying to only limit myself to you things like that so the height is definitely 8 out of 10 it's not getting me too high I'm pretty sure if I keep hitting you know [ __ ] you kill me but you know we're not gonna we're probably gonna take one more trip for the boys so yeah definitely overall product I'm the price point is probably the only downside but then again you're paying for good quality stuff you know like this isn't something that you can get just anywhere in the world it's only just one section of the United States you know one part and that's kind of what makes it valuable this is very very exotic and it's not like anyone could go out and buy this and not everyone will go out and buy this even if they if it was disposable like you know right around the corner from them like people always are gonna go for the cheaper price and it's always good to just have a good smoke you know that's one thing that I've been trying to do with myself like instead of just smoking like mid mid mid like price [ __ ] and smoking it all day just limp and then just ruining your tolerance ruining the overall experience just go out buy something like this just take a hit in the morning take a hit in the afternoon take a hit at night that's three times you take two or three hits you'll conserve it like no doubt and you'll be smoking good [ __ ] so you take another hit probably in the video and you guys know the deal super gas by far I'm gonna have to make a top 5 distillate card soon or just cartridges in general if you everyone see that let me know and we're gonna end the video here go ahead and follow me on my answer here I'm at backwe daddy turn on the post notifications on this YouTube channel because I'm gonna be posting vlogs which is something different I'm gonna be trying to put them a lot more effort and going into those because I don't want to just stick to reviews and just you know the normal in the car stuff I want you I want to be able to show you guys in my life and show you guys a little little parts of my life not the full of things but you know show you guys things that you know I would see in my daily life like smokes and things like that so yeah if you guys enjoyed the video go ahead and hit that like comment and sub and then were see you guys later", "z5d8bFY33_w": "[Music] what's up YouTube is your boy JC vlogs back at it again with another [ __ ] video a lot of you have been asking me to review the big sheaf extracts disposable pods that they came out with a disposable carts I picked one up today it's a half gram of the white widow they were actually really really convenient you know they it's a disposable cart so it comes ready with the battery and everything are you gotta do is pay the plug first and they're gonna go you open the box you hit it and that's it got the white widow don't know if you guys can see it right there we're gonna go ahead and see you know what's good about this cart what it does how it tastes first thing the Box the Box feels really really sturdy the Box feels really good on here has the name and everything the little endian guy on there it has like a little safety right there so you can't ann's a little pool you have to pull it so you can you know come out but it's locked it's dumb proof so you gotta you gotta push this button right here and then you put it that's it [Music] yes so first off here's the here's the pot right there there it is it looks really good and like a wood finish so let's take it out of here Mika damn this [ __ ] is childproof hey guys pull out the vape pen here it is that's what it looks like that's a pretty pretty nice design I'm not gonna lie as the USB port right there so you can charge we got a full half gram a full half convinced makes so much sense Oh so yeah has a little hook seal so make sure you guys don't swallow it so let's put that to the side real quick on the box it says manufactured by Kelley Blue Sky investment Inc license number comes from San Bernardino California big sheep extracts they're supposed to good about this no buttons no nothing so you just put it up to your mouth and inhale so let's go I'm not sure it was a bigger book whoa all right so right off the bat it's a pretty harsh one guess in there man he gets to the lungs it's gonna be causing a little bit so let's go for rip number two tell you guys a little bit about the taste all right so that was a blinker I'm not sure that's ten seconds but it might be a five-second blinker this one's the white widow this one tastes pretty good I'm not gonna lie it has a good taste to it it's pretty therapy tastes fruity taste like mangos that's what I got off of it mango taste let's try to take two blinkers and one oh yeah just a flavor alone you got out for this it's really really good for a half gram disposable vape and I'm not gonna lie it's really really good I could really feel the little my body I feel pretty good so let's take another hit somebody that's really good guys so for you guys that recommended this big she vape pen that disposable vape half gram thank you guys I'm I'm honestly really like in this car hc' distillate chart art cartridge THC this in a cartridge pesticide free and organic high potency and lab tested nowadays you don't even know what it says they have an Instagram on here at big sheep extracts so go ahead and follow them on Instagram big sheep extracts I like this this cart was a success that you guys I recommended it and I'll catch you guys on the next one [Music] you [Music]", "eDhPQFf9I5g": "so I took that little thing off of there da da da and I got my extra battery case from my brother Chad Thank You Chad when I screw this on to there like so if it fits and it should fit no problem and boom ready to go that looks weird as [ __ ] but we are ready to go get high as a [ __ ] cool where's that", "FmAmYTR77wE": "welcome to oregon cannabis community reviews this is going to be my first video here and i'm going to be reviewing today a punchberry crossed with blueberry distillate cart by buddies get that close there i've been really enjoying the buddy's distillate carts and i get a good deal on them matt especially and they have great info on the terpenes on the back which i really love [Music] been searching for more rare terpenes but these ones are pretty standard so we'll start with the cannabinoids in oregon the top two cannabinoids have to be displayed on the front so we got thc got 82.6 percent or 826 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol this is all activated so no thca and then second it's actually kanab and gerald i believe uh cbg at 2.43 percent or 24.3 milligrams you don't see a lot of that in many cannabis products so these are interesting for that i'm not sure if i can say i've felt the effects or anything but it's interesting then we've got cbd down here at just point 21 or 2.10 milligrams i believe that is gonna be up here so that's all of our cannabinoids you can see all the test dates and any of that information over here but what i find most interesting is the terpenes which we'll look at so like i said i usually go for some more interesting terpenes but these aren't terribly in my opinion we got limonene just plain lemon at 2.44 percent then you got beta myrsine which is just kind of a musty i just described it as like the general weed smell if you walk into a dispensary you just get hit in the face with mirror scene pretty much and then you got pinene pining you don't find very much of in buddy's carts so that was kind of interesting at 0.46 percent um i don't know if i said that made a mirror scene that's that point five six percent either that was terribly much the distillates aren't going to be very turkey so we'll open this let me open hc a little bit um has their facebook and instagram says ad buddies brand www.buddiesbrand.com what does that say bake with buddies um on the sides i'll show the sides as well just to help you all see what a legit one will look like let's distill it anyways bottom it's nothing top just buddy's brand logo and then i removed a sticker so there's some adhesive you can see there and some nastiness um this bow i go to has the price stickers right there every time it's a real pain in the ass so when you get it out then you will have this tube always comes in a dub tube like child safe thing which is required by law here in oregon i'm sure most states as well on that you'll have the thc and cbd content and more info including the uid and just cannabis extract one gram so this is the distillate very nice and clear very good looking stuff um the sticker you can just take right off i always do just a little marijuana sticker that's required by the state each state has a state-specific one that's organs so pop that rubber cap off the bottom here and i'll pop it into my vape and i'll try and give some insight into how it tastes so again the top three terpenes are it's going to be limonene betamycine and alpha pinene neither of those very much at all of so let's try this out i'm going to try this first on what i believe is 2.7 volts okay this one's a very light taste even for a distillate card not very much terpene taste of that uh weirdly enough the i would say the pinene and myrosine mixed with the lemon does actually give it a bit of a berry flavor i didn't expect that because i don't really find lemonade to be as fruity as a lot of the fruity strains say that really does taste like it though i would say that's um just a kind of vague berry taste yeah just like a little bit of lemon a little bit of berry i'm definitely not as much of a like fruity berry florally taste as terpenoline but not a bad card at all so i'll give you one more look at that card all right", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "Q5xorweaNTU": "So you want to add terpenes to your THC\nproduct. Well how much terpenes do you use? That's called the dilution ratio. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and\nI'm here today to tell you the truth about what dilution ratio you should be\nusing in this week's episode: \"Terpene Dilution Ratios\" from The Terpene\nInstitute. So you want to start mixing terpenes in your product, and you don't\nknow how much to use, and your products are expensive, and you don't want to mess\nit up. I totally got that, all right. So what I'm gonna do, is there's a whole\nbunch of different products that you can mix terpenes with, and I want to do a\nvideo on every single one. I'm gonna give you a tutorial, whether you already make\nproducts, or you're just thinking about it, on how to make every single different\nproduct with our terpenes. But the fact is, I just don't have time right now. So\nI'm gonna give you a basic understanding on how much you should use with all\ndifferent products. And I'll skim through it, and hopefully this gets you going, and\nlater you can watch a full tutorial on each individual product. I'll just give\nyou a walk down on how to make it. Make it, sell it, knock yourself out, alright? So\none of the main things that people are doing right now is they're taking our\nterpenes and they're mixing them with distillate and they're making a vapor\npen. So how much do you want to use? Now, always, every batch of distillate is\ngonna be different. And all terpenes are a little bit different, but they're all\npretty much the same. So I tell everybody; no matter how professional you are, no\nmatter how big you are, no matter how small you are, you always want to do a\nsmall batch first. If you have a thousand grams of distillate, and a big jar\nterpenes, don't just mix the two together because if you blow it, then you're\nscrewed. Start with the 1 gram batch. Get your\nratio- I do that on every product I ever make and so do large companies. Small\nbatch testing, that's the term for it. So what I recommend is that, well first off,\nyou need to understand that the ratio between terpenes and your product is\ngoing to differ every single time, because your distillate will always come\nout a different viscosity and it depends on what pen you use every different pen\nand cartridge that you use has different hole sizes in there and burns\ndifferently if it likes specific viscosity that it works best at\nknow your cartridge first and make a few different samples and see which one\nactually tastes best and smokes with the biggest clouds in the cartridge that\nyou're using and then don't switch because you're gonna have to do it all\nover every single time so basically with distillate you want to start out at 10%\nof terpenes no you take your distillate say you got 100 grams of tur picking a\nhundred grams of distillate 10 grams of terpenes now you're gonna want to mix\nthat heat does help the smallest amount of heat quickly mix it and make sure it\nemulsifies all together now if you heat something at a low temperature for a\nlong time at darkens I've personally found that if I heat it high really\nquickly and stir it and then cool it down I have less darkening because it's\nreally like a baking effect in my opinion high heat doesn't always like\ninstantly flash it everyone's got a different opinion on it so whatever you\ndo you have to heat it up a little bit make sure that it emulsifies in and take\nthe heat away from it and then you want to let it cool down to room temperature\nbecause your client is gonna be using that pen at room temperature you want to\nput it in the pen while it's still warm check your pen at room temperature not\nhot see how the bubble moves see how it smokes and if I were you I'd make a\ncouple different pens at different rates and find out what works best for your\npen like I said it's gonna be different there's a million types of pens out\nthere you may live in Arizona where everything's 100 degrees you may live in\nAlaska you're gonna want to make it a little runny or in Alaska and a little\nthicker in Arizona so all custom work here so you've mixed in 10% this works\ngreat it's probably not gonna be too runny I could pretty much guarantee that\nbut if it's too thick still then you can just add a little bit more terpenes and\nstir it in being that the terpenes have already emulsified in your distillate\nyou don't need to reheat it at that point it will mix in just by hand just\nfine now if you've made it to a thin add more\ndistillate in there stir it back up until you've got it the right way you'll\nnever really ruin a batch if you're doing that ballpark ratios for\ndistillate 10 to 15% is what we recommend now like I said we work out of\nLos Angeles we supply some of the largest pen companies in the country\ndown in Los Angeles and we always talk with their R&D teams what they're\nfinding is you can get the amount of terpenes to make it function in the pen\nbut customers are actually just getting more flavor they you know they\njust really want to taste some things and that's what we're just seeing across\nthe board always work with what your clients want because that's your main\ngoal not what you want nobody really cares what you like just remember that\nyou got to keep it in perspective you may be the owner of a company nobody\ncares customers want what they want so make sure to give them choices and let\nthem choose you know it's one of the fallacies that we all have as\nmanufacturers that everybody thinks like us so give them a few options let them\nchoose if they want a more flavorful pen or a less flavorful pen cannabis\nprofiles flavor profiles whatever remember 10 to 15% is a ballpark in Los\nAngeles in the major areas we are finding that they like a little bit more\nterpenes for a more robust flavor in their pen thistle it tastes like crap\nanyway I think it tastes like plastic and I don't like the taste of it I'd\nrather have a little more flavoring a little weaker pen and take an extra hit\nof something I liked then one less hit of something that I don't now when\nyou're dealing with shatter and hard extracts you have to remember there's a\nwindow here the scale you've got liquefied oil down here you've got solid\nshatter over here you are taking either end of this spectrum and you're trying\nto get it into a liquid obviously this oil over here is closer\nto a liquid already so all you have to do is add a little bit of terpenes if\nyou're over here in a solid state you're gonna have to add more terpenes so on\nthe hardest shatter we've ever seen just like some glass the most we've ever had\nto add was 50% by weight cool thing about my products which makes them\nbetter than other people's products as other companies give you a max dilution\nratio of 5 to 8% because they do not know how to blend their terpenes watch\nmy other videos on how to blend terpenes and why our products are better\nscientifically our products will taste fine at 50% you try doing that with\nanother company your throats going to get all jacked up because they don't\nknow how to do it they're just reading a piece of paper from a lab we don't do\nthat we handcraft our blends so that regardless of what product you're using\nit's gonna taste good and it's gonna taste the same and it's not gonna be\nharsh so for BHO some solid shatter you're gonna want to use a up to a 50%\nratio we can pretty much guarantee that all of our products will taste good up\nto a 50% ratio and it's kind of unheard of other companies require the use of\nMCTS or polyethylene glycol as a cutting agent I don't like it it's not how we\ndeveloped our product so one gram of BHO shatter 2\nthe half a gram now our terpenes are about 48 drops per gram so if you don't\nhave a scale and you have a gram of shattered what does that 24 drops will\nliquify that down so what about wax isn't crumble well that's just in the\nmiddle of the scale so you know you've got 10% over here 50% over here you\nwaxing your crumbles are going to be at about 25 to 30% those things usually\ncome out fogging when you stir them up if you have an extract and you mix them\nterpenes and it's kind of foggy hit it with a little heat those are your waxes\nthat are showing the waxes loosen up they melt and then they emulsify\nthemselves back in there and then it stays clear it's a really cool process\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do demo videos on each one of these I'm\ngoing to take some distillate I'm gonna mix it I'm going to show you the\ndifferences in everything I'm gonna take some BHO it makes it teach you how to do\nall that and another time right now I've just got a lot on my plate so hopefully\nthese basic ratios help you out in your products and go try it out start with a\nsmall batch always make sure it functions at room temperature always\nscale yourself up there's companies out there making millions of dollars that\nstarted in their garage and so can you alright so thanks for watching the\nterpene Institute was created just to give you a simple common-sense\nunderstanding of terpenes and the cannabis industry make some money help\nsome people trying to help you guys out alright thank you for watching go to mr.\nextract or calm I will see you in the next episode take it easy", "xhICd92Z8Xo": "guys this is Florida MJ 4:20 here I'm a medical patient in the state of Florida and today's video is about the pocket cartridge guess that's what you call it's a oil cartridge these are I'm not sure how long they've been out but they were having this great sale where you you just pay shipping and you get them for free and I love this thing okay this is my favorite I like these way better than sea cells they don't clog as much but there's a problem that I just discovered today take a close look and what you'll see is do you see that right there that blue do you see that blue speck up inside of there okay let's find some more there's a blue speck right inside of this hole it's getting sucked into the cartridge it's getting sucked into the ceramic wick let's see how many more we find here's one I don't know if I recorded that one is this one it's hard to keep this at the right angle and in the light that one looks clear here's an aspect right there you see it so at first I noticed I was getting some harsh hits and I was like what's up with my fake what's going on with it and then I looked I noticed these blue things and I'm like what in the world is that and then I realize it's from these gaskets they don't work I mean they're not they can't stand up to this so I've used C cells for like well over a year and I've never had this problem with them so this is a simple problem that you should be able to fix you know this company exactly what the parent company is hopefully you can see this but see look do you see that it's shredded just screwing this thing back together shreds the gaskets and it puts it into your vapor I've now ruined a whole tank almost half a tank but you know I've now ruined all of this stuff it's got plastic or whatever this is all up inside of my distillate now so I can't use this you see I don't want to smoke this blue plastic or whatever it is and let me see you I'm gonna it looks like it's just like I don't know it's disintegrating almost and this is just dispensary distillate this is legal dispensary distillate from true leaf okay this is not some kind of black market stuff that's you know all weird and eaten everything alive because of how crazy it is I mean so pocket man I was I was looking to go over to your cartridges 100% because I your design you have a better design and I'm not gonna say why until I do the review on these after hopefully you fixed them but you'd have a better design it doesn't clog as much so please fix this problem and if you got if you got a pocket cartridge out there right now I think you need to tape pay close attention to what you're vaping and make sure that you don't have a bunch of silicon rubber or what that stuff is clogging up your holes and it's not just clogging I mean it's going inside there see if we can get this see is inside the hole it's getting sucked in there when I first looked there were a bunch more around these holes that I don't see anymore because what happened was I went out to eat and I noticed this when we sat down and then as we're eating I completely forgot and I took a couple of Apes when we went out to the car and I probably sucked some up in there because there were a bunch more down the hood by these holes but what is that I count at five five little chunks of silicone come on there look in that hole that's what that's about to be vaped and this one I'm not sure what's in this hole it could be more it's probably more of the plastic but it looks obstructed and it has a little bubble stuck in it doesn't look like the other ones at all and see even this one has a bubble but it's clear this one on the other hand looks like it's got a chunk in it or something all right well thanks for watching and I hope they fix this problem because it's a good product otherwise have a good one", "0xh5liVaWpY": "yeah today is the temperature this is going to determine when we have vapors moving across the system right in this region so if I look at it right now let's change it to Celsius it says twenty six point six degrees Celsius so let's just keep our eye on this thermometer all time straight during the process it's a something that you guys are going to see constantly fluctuating again it's going to help you determine whether you're in a fraction or not so our 27 degrees so 26.6 to 20 so the set point is a little higher we're at 40 on the mantel and we're right about where we need to do as far as the bath temperature and it's almost reached our set like the activity which we're doing more water in here then I call you with life and some people you know previously you may be concerned about water in your extract right sometimes I don't want water in my extract when it comes to for conservation I mean you can throw sand in that flat you can throw like any creditor realistically you can separate it by going so now right now is actually a point where I switch my chiller so you guys notice that the slur is getting kind of we've got to move all of the trailer we've got the chiller over here set to one degree Celsius but for the process of THC one degree Celsius you can see me about the slide building up here it's going to be too cold for our THC to run on its going to actually start to stall and back up and basically kind of clogged up in the condenser so we need to turn it to is I'd say 55 degrees is a pretty good temperature you can go anywhere from 45 to 55 I've started out at 40 zero staying through the system - yeah that's all the water stamp that water steam and terpenes being distilled together definitely definitely so the reason I'm now switch my condenser over me now is I still have ethanol and stuff going on and I need the connector kind of so cold for a little bit it's because it's going to take we need to have both functions but if you were able to remove ethanol so say you had a rotary evaporator you had a simple spill or something that was doing your distillation of ethanol and getting you down to that food sludge and then you're going to your short path that's what you're already cold and then you don't need it cold for you the in the fashion of how crude it is it's kind of one of these byproducts this a lot of people before were like hiding it cracker which I'm generating class so you do want that full vacuum as much as possible I really don't want to lessen the vacuum or introduce any oxygen or anything in the equation she's doing a spiral and there's a couple different spiral paddle patterns they don't notice it will make and there's actually a cool video on this guy smarter every day Destin on YouTube is a really great Tuffy's cool YouTube viral videos he's got one on the spiraling pattern here the habits or not and he's as Bernie as an example he'll take a honeycomb to pick it up and the erotic a stacking we can kind of Judge there we go anyway because it's based on it's actually face out so my elbow it's a number one into the midnight gravity so that can give you a use the core now we're at equilibrium is - it's actually very depressed when it's light its absolute popular for everything vacuum temperature vapor pressure basically will tell you the overall usefulness if your goal if your goal is came from that by three to five percent if that extra three to five the two important to you but it's going to take time equation it's very cool dad with the reflex right now exactly why I know it's not refluxing too high and we got an excellent flow rate and the reflux is low it's not boiling all the way up the to put it that's like ideal where we're at right now it's perfect it's just jewelry on the bottom the color is awesome yeah that's good and then there's that green fraction over there suppose we got rid of", "auvAgcovK6Y": "sup guys

to be as bad for you and all that you know but I mean if you never know what something is just google it a lot of times we'll discover that there is legal pesticides in it but here's the Bashan numbers and no matter what as you can see this does not say pesticide free folks look at my last video and this does not say it let's see if it has any I mean I bet it has illegal honestly I better add some kind of legal pesticide in so I'm not seeing the actual ingredients on this you could always pause it go over it yourself but yeah a lot of you already know the three times here's the actual

said guys good stuff man good stuff man yeah that's Maui wowie thank you guys I give this one a 8 it's been a better Carter just potency it keeps me in a boo-boo they don't got the flavor some of them

this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a

sure you like subscribe and watch to the end for a chance to win a free prize also check out my website that be dead without Ohio canvass live.com enjoy the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "X3tfCAKTfa0": "oh it's up its everything thank you back with another video so I hear a little bit of background like washing machines on so yeah but uh anyways I'm here with the review I'm trying to make this one better cuz my last two like they're like every other video if something was [ __ ] up in it but whatever this is gonna be like but good hopefully I'll make everything good but um anyways I got spliff in pure good vibes super Lemon Haze sativa right here bye spliff in bluefin calm let's see the three dish pure THC sensual experience uniquely pleasurable taste for construction of a spliff and calm for medical use and the patient thank so I got this one I'm not gonna open this right now because I already opened the other one this one is tangi it has a little ice on that are you looking at this one too it's go inside the package yeah you can see it has a little S on there too the same way I honestly got a new brass knuckles battery it was pretty nice yeah so my battery had to die well that's fine because I'm already super dab doubt and I'm just gonna talk about this cartridge for a little bit um it it hits really hard like it hit I have this other cartridge I had a potent potion which is a good syringe and I filled up a gram cartridge ah I didn't fill it up all the way but like I filled up most of it and like it doesn't give me nearly as faded as this but this shit's like a killer it's [ __ ] dank like it makes him like hard to breathe after which is weird like it looks like it comes with you as you can see like it doesn't look full and it's like that all the way around and like I've only been using it mine for a day it's already there but like I don't know what's up with that but it's a really wide cartridge so I don't know and it is only a half gram so won't last that long but um yeah I really like it it's really hard and peace", "Iv_gPNVA4Os": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is my top five cartridges but not of 2020 to start off 2021 because [ __ ] 2020 i don't even want to care about that [ __ ] anymore you know so i titled this the top five cartridges to start 2021 with before i start this video any further let's take a [ __ ] hit i got this bougie on a budget cart i i was just fresh off doing that video so i may look pretty [ __ ] high because i am but let's take a [ __ ] another hit here cheers and i might i say that this is a sleeper cartridge i just found out about this not too long ago i just bought it a few days ago and tried it today uh it's not going to be on the list but definitely an honorable mention like this is the only strain i've tried that's why i like i don't really want to like put it in the top five because i had my top five already set uh before making this video but this cartridge man this is this should definitely get some praise for what the price is and for what the quality is bougie on a budget um but i digress let's get started so uh let's just get done with the honorable mentions first uh we got raw garden i know a lot of people don't consider it live resin but i still do because it has the live resin terps which is what makes live resin live resin right the terps the initial terpenes from actually freezing the plants and all that stuff but they give the higher percentage of thc that comes with distillate as well so it's kind of like the best of both worlds but that is an honorable mention also i would say maybe select i've tried a few of them i've tried one personally myself that i bought and it was pretty good uh just it was all right uh you know nothing to really that blew my mind but i've tried another one from flynn it was pretty good you know um but let's get on to it we got number five we got buddies and i wouldn't be like mad if it was a little bit higher on the list because buddies has just been the brand of the year for me but in terms of cartridges i have to put it there because they do seem to like okay well first before i start getting into the list i should mention the things that i consider when it comes to cartridges is the hardware itself the oil the vapor production uh the price not so much because that's all based on location and you know buddies for me is cheap and sometimes it's cheap for other people too but it's more expensive for other people too so price even though i consider that one of the most important factors i won't consider it for the sake of this video um and also i'd like to mention that this is my [ __ ] list right so it's just me you know i'm not the cartridge god or some [ __ ] you know it's just some guy on the internet okay so like if i don't have a certain brand or whatever cartridge in your in the list like there's no reason to get upset put your opinions down below your top five and let's get started buddies brand of the year for me but uh unfortunately they just seem to really run out quick you know but they're priced so good but like i said price in this list doesn't really uh for the sake of this this video isn't really uh as important but yes buddies is there it has that cdt cartridges it has the live resin cartridges and they have a lot of strains to this day they have a lot of strains you know and to this day peach flambe upside down cake and orange eight are [ __ ] just phenomenal the green box ones just great uh and then we got coming in at four and uh three and four can be switched i mean actually no okay no it's a clear cut so four would be nug just enjoyable it's everything you would get from a green box buddies uh just last a lot longer than buddies buddy seems for me it just lasts like two or three days you know and uh i don't know it's just i don't know but nug just enjoyable i've tried a few of their stuff i think i've tried like three i don't have these cartridges on me but i will put videos on the screen as i'm talking about them because i've tried them and uh yeah nug was uh enjoyable cartridge lasted really really long compared to buddies and just the taste was phenomenal the live resin was true to the train uh but yes that will be number four number three uh like i said uh initially that i wouldn't be mad if you switched three and four is the jetties extracts their unrefined live resin just hit you can take a look at the classiest way to smoke a cartridge video or use a cartridge video money and me were just surprised at the wedding cake that i got from them it was just fat hits tasty phenomenal hits and this [ __ ] got me faded so uh yes coming in at three will be jenny's extracts and uh number two and number one can also be switched but based on just you know people being in the game longer than the other one you know i'll just i'll leave number one as it is and but for number two is alpine and uh i mean uh say what you want about it being a new live resident into the market they initially did you know this lit and other stuff it's fire like they have a ceramic car as well it's [ __ ] phenomenal the phenomenal taste it's true to the strain as well and it's just an all-around tasty experience the ceramic heart really makes it a difference when it comes to the taste and uh obviously you know the variety of whatever voltage used to uh changes the taste as well but they recommend it maybe 2 to 2.6 i would say but yes alpine live resin second in my book let's just take a hit before i reveal number one but i'm sure you guys still know what number one is i mean it's on my old list right so cheers good stuff number one is urza to this day urza has been established as the number one you know they're the first ones to really just come through with that ceramic i could be wrong but to my knowledge they had the ceramic cards uh i know walks has it now i haven't tried walks but i've heard walks and urza are like kind of the same company so um but yeah urzah to this day had just the most dab like experience from a cartridge the taste was there the smoothness of the hit was there you know a low temp dab obviously and it was just all around a great experience you know got me high um and yeah it was just it was just good they did have a few hiccups you know they had to switch back to the non-ceramic hearts but uh i think they're uh using dental grade ceramic now so all everything is good but yes there you have it for my list i know you guys have been waiting for this and it's been a long time overdue you know so i will take one lasting hit before i end this video let me know your opinions down below on my list and give me your list as well you know you know if you want to put mario karts in there and all that stuff for jokes as well because i know that's going to happen as well so cheers so oh okay all right there you go peace out guys [Music] you", "SriW9qrOruc": "yo yo yo it's your boy ja'crispy aka Jay Christie man you know why cuz we stayed fried and welcome to another episode man so got some Bronto here today some Bronto slash gold leaf shout out to them for centimeter care package man if you follow me on instagram at Chicago stony Oh 93 you would have saw the care package opening I did and you know a couple of things they sent me some dope swag so today we got some flour we got some motor breath I've been dying to try this man I've been holding it out to do a review on it I just got a gram of it and then I've already smoked the cart but we have a lemon cake in essence gold leaf cart fire so we're gonna get a of course up-close look at a nut break of this fine fine Verano flour so cold man let's get a look at this flower alright so this is the motor breath this is a gram of it Wow I mean holy [ __ ] I don't know if I could say that but Wow check that out you guys this is a heavy hitter too this is a new batch this is coming in at thirty four point eight eleven percent again this is motorbreath man this is look at that let's do a nut cracker huh which one should we crack alright man let's go ahead and uh grind some up and smoke some but before we do that real quick before I forget mmm this is the gold leaf essence cart now the essence cart this is for people who necessarily don't necessarily want the full taste of cannabis or even the smell sometimes me I don't mind it but I got it because it was nice there's 10 bucks cheaper than so this is it it's empty but I mean it moved slow this lasted me which any other car I've ever had is never lasted me past two or three days and that's a grand cart so this is pretty freakin good man this is the total cannabinoids eighty eight point three zero six percent so I suggest you guys try out the essence car or even the 100% pure nectar goldleaf anorexia Verano great stuff great products great cards great flower check them out man let's get into this motor breath and we'll talk a little more about it cool man alright guys we got a nice fat chunky bowl the motor breath so while I'm smoking this and we wait for some of the effects come on in just tell you a little bit about the essence car and then some of the motor breaths so cool man Cheers it's definitely gassy definitely gassy but um this is by Murano like a gold leaf again like I wanted to tell you guys this is a new badge testing at the highest I've seen it tested at just a double check this was I think like I said earlier in a video 34.8 one 1% that's total cabinets this was definitely a home run so shout out to you guys Verano for doing your thing man shout out to greenhouse and Moors for supplying us where our medication love you guys thank you for everything you do if you're new to channel man go check it out like share and subscribe support your boy doing his thing Verano gold leaf again like I said early in the video they sent me a care package I got some bra no socks I already had some gold leaf socks that I got on 4/20 they gave me this cool lanyard gold leaf lanyard a dope-ass pen man this is it only engages on inhale its buttonless so don't do it easy charge I mean this thing lasted me literally probably two days I think on that half gram cart so like I said that's motor breath man dad is gonna be a cross between I think was a chem dog D it says and San Fernando Valley og so you know those are two two elites right there so it across them - man I come up with this it only makes sense to why it's so damn fire so man so yeah man other than that the essence cart dope stuff if you're not a flower smoker or maybe you just only take edibles or cards or whatever your thing is I highly suggest trying the cards on I've had only one other card from pts that was a good card but by far these are the best cards I've had in my entire life including before I was a patient so like I said essence card man there's nothing taken away from this cannabis it is a hundred percent solvent from what it says they extract all the solvents with being able to keep all the terpenes intact as well so it's just as potent as it was before it was distilled there or turned into what it is here so you can't go wrong man it's not like you're getting you know carts off the streets where you got that that clear it's mostly they do store this lid in there you know you don't have the the concentrate at all or any of the oil or whatever it is I'm not a professional man I'm sorry so anyways long story short man definitely go try great product class with me like I said 500 milligrams I got and it lasted me about three to three and a half days great stuff can't go wrong fire I was pledged dude all day every day so cool man shout-out to you guys for some more dope dope [ __ ] but yeah man I love you guys like always men support your boy doing his thing smash that thumbs up button man of course like I said like share and subscribe show your mom and your daddy your granny uncle your brother your sister your cousin I don't care who they are but this is the channel for them and if they smoke they're impatient they want to see some dope content or just some dope reviews some come check it out man so once again it should boys you Chris be a cage a Christian man you know why cuz we stayed fried in a mouth [Music]", "9CJQL5RZLPw": "welcome back to the channel everybody my name is grim from wku consulting and today we are going to be talking about how to make delta 8 from a short path in a short path if you're moving into an industrial size scale this process will not work for you however on a bench top scale this will work perfectly depending on how much delta 8 that you have or need for your production so without any further ado [Music] [Music] all right guys well and girls whoever is watching out there how to make delta 8 in a short path we have a lot of things to cover in this video so we're going to be moving pretty quickly if you have something questions or anything feel free to leave those in the comment or reach out in the description below as always like subscribe and share for a chance to be enrolled in our free cannabis education course if you're watching this on youtube if this is part of your course then you will undoubtedly have the full-fledged material in front of your face and congratulations on making it this far so first off we need to talk about is delta 8 legal because there's a lot of things going around in the market right now and in the industry where people are very scared because of the production that they were doing on delta eight and then all of a sudden some additions to the farm bill came out they kind of uh retrofitted that a little bit and so there's been a big misunderstanding on whether or not delta eight was legal anymore here is the clause that a lot of people are worried about right here and i'll just go ahead and read the quote the 2018 farm bill does not impact the control status of synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols thcs for controlled substance code number 7370 because the statutory definition of hemp is limited to materials that are derived from the plant cannabis sativa l for synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols the concentration of delta 9 thc is not a determining factor in whether the material is a controlled substance all synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols remain schedule one controlled substances so this has people in an uproar basically because they thought that they had a way to get a little bit high delta eight does have mildly psychoactive effects and so they started producing it then this clause in the farm bill came out people started losing their minds they say oh my gosh delta eight is going to be illegal so is delta 8 legal the short answer is yes yes delta 8 is legal and i'll explain why the long answer is yes but if you do not have a comprehensive understanding of the laws and regulations in your industry i would highly advise that you don't do it if you cannot understand the legality in your laboratory just leave that specific process alone or to the professionals or call somebody like me and we'll be happy to go over it but where people are getting caught up is the term synthetically derived now delta 8 is a phytocannabinoid that naturally exists in the cannabis plant it's organically derived its natural occurrence is too low to be extracted out right but it is my understanding here that the isomerization process takes place to convert the cbd into delta eight thc now isomerization is the transformation of one isomer to another isomers being molecule with the same molecular formula but having a different arrangement of the atoms in space i personally don't believe that isomerization converts a phytocannabinoid into a synthetic one into the manner that synthetic is being used by the dea the 2018 farm bill definition of hemp includes all isomers of hemp it's in the law therefore any isomer of the hemp plant is also hemp and pursuant to the 2018 farm bill does not fall under the csa or the controlled substances act so what i believe is the reference to synthetically derived is referring and this is with contacts with people in the dea and in the fda as well so this is my understanding um you know as a professional consultant for 10 years and not just something that i've gathered information on google for instance but something that i've had long talks with uh professionals in the uh the legislation department of this industry so i believe that synthetically derived is referring to a man-made chemical not a process by which someone at a lab isomerizes one organic molecule to another for example cbd to delta eight thc if the concept that any material formed from any sort of human controlled chemical action taking place means that the material is synthetically derived then that would mean that all of the hemp derived products that go through processing are synthetic this is the law and that's simply not the case so here i've uh i've put a little article you guys can copy and paste this into your browser so you can go back over and uh and look at that and you know this is just going to help you determine what is a synthetic cannabinoid or what is a synthetic material and uh what is uh from synthetic biosynthesis and what is just plant-based extraction and the organic isomers that occur inside of that hemp material this will give you a little bit of good information uh that you can look over for that if you're still kind of not clear but what this did in essence was to combat the synthetic marijuanas or the synthetic delta nine thcs that have begun to circulate the market um i don't know what all of them are called k2 this is not my area of expertise i don't really get into that you know k2 and the other spice or whatever people are going to their local head shops and getting and it is getting them extremely uh giving them extremely psychoactive effects this was made to combat that not the already existing phytocannabinoids inside of the hemp and cannabis plant now that we covered that i hope that you have a better understanding of you know that in particular but um here we are moving on so this is the golden ticket this is what you will find this is a very simple process i say simple but i am an organic chemist by trade consultant now however as far as organic chemistry goes this one is relatively simple to achieve and the um level of danger that is associated or the level of risk that is associated with this process is very minimal now you can find this stuff this is t41 bleaching clay uh you can find this pretty much everywhere carbon chemistry is the one that i have up here extractor depot if you just simply google where do i find t41 you can get it on amazon but this is the stuff that's actually facilitating the isomerization of cbd into delta eight and also delta nine thc into delta eight so i didn't give you any links in the descriptions or anything like that uh because it's a relatively simple um piece of material to find now here is a basic short path and using this we're going to go over first the application and um you know this is a really simple setup i found this on dhgate which is an overseas amazon type thing not the most trustworthy for equipment suppliers so i'm not referring you to these guys down here however this short path is pretty basic and you could do it and this you could do this same reaction in this short path there are some things that i would change about this short path but it will work for illustrative purposes so first we're gonna go into the pieces this is what's called a boiling flask here you have your temperature probe which is connected to your mantle your mantle will have magnetic stir bark capabilities as well as temperature sensors to heat up this boiling flask as things boil off in here and turn into a vapor they will come up through this distillation head or distillation head but this head unit here uh this is a really relatively simple normally you'd want to have as much surface area for the vapors to climb on as uh as possible to kind of increase your your distillation ratio and purity however i really like this one uh that's pictured here because you are able to um pack it with material like steel wool and also there is a nipple here that if you have a good glass blower you can go ahead and insert another vapor temperature probe right there and then just simply a top but this is connected to what's called a liebig condenser and this is what will be heated up however comparatively speaking from boiling flask to liebig condenser this will actually be a lot cooler than the boiling flask and as the vapors are boiling off they will recondense down this line and drop into your cowl now i don't like the triple cal system because i like to get the most purity as possible so just simply rotating and allowing vapors to kind of run around in here decreases the chance of just that really excellent level of purity i like to just break down my machine isolate the vacuum somewhere with another piece that i have put in there and uh be able to just take off that collection orb and put a new one on there however this is will work for illustrative purposes uh you can turn this cowl this triple cal system to collect your different fractions without breaking into the vacuum and restarting the reaction and this will be connected here to a cold trap which if i'm being honest is just to preserve the life of your vacuum pump you will put you know something like dry ice and alcohol in here to keep everything cold and then your vacuum line will be attached down here you will also collect some volatiles down here uh they will smell horrible be gross and that's the worst part of this whole uh if you're using your vacuum over here i always suggest vacuuming or exporting your vacuum out to a ventilation system because that's just that fishy odor is just one of the odors that me personally i am not a big fan in most of the odors in our industry are quite pleasant but that one is gross and then you just have you know your supports this is a manual lift to kind of keep everything straight uh this doesn't have as many supports as i would like i'd kind of build a frame over here to support that but that is a short path and that's what you can use and here we'll get into the application so the application we will add 100 grams of the t-41 that we showed you earlier for every five liters of crude to be distilled first i will add my t-41 to my boiling flask using a glass funnel then i will add my warm crude oil what i like to do is just go straight from decarboxylation into distillation uh makes things much easier much smoother much faster in your distillation process we're gonna set our stir bar at 100 rpms and let that start homogenizing inside of there in your boiling flask or on your mantle you will ramp up the temperature this is imperative i know a lot of people that just come in and they set their mantle to 205 c that's a no-no because the um the mantle will over compensate for the temperature that it's supposed to be producing therefore parts of your reaction will actually be hotter or cooler than other parts and it won't be reacting uniformly and we don't like that we do not want that so we're going to ramp up the temperature by 10 degrees celsius until 205 degrees celsius is reached and i put here adjust the fraction accordingly because um at approximately 165 to 175 you're going to start collecting what i like to call your head's fraction which is going to be a lot of your terpenes and volatiles magnesium that list kind of goes on and on and uh here is a basic definition for you if it drips it's no good if it coils and you'll notice that as it comes down it begins to coil along the bottom of the collection orb if it coils its oil and uh you know so you'll get your heads your main body which is the good stuff and then you'll collect your tails the tails will be significantly more viscous and darker color it's very hard to miss that you're into your tails fraction um so that's what i mean by just fractions accordingly you don't want to collect them all into the same orb but rather three separate orbs so at around c once you're really getting deep into your head's fraction and you're about to begin boiling off your main body you want to adjust your stir bar to around 300 rpm and then collect all of your fractions accordingly and that's it you will notice in using the t41 one of the first things that you will notice is a significant color decrease now this stuff will be almost water clear if not as clear as water so if you're watching this and you're like oh my gosh what's happening don't worry this is supposed to happen this is what a lot of people at the beginning of this industry when there wasn't much research about this they were calling it aqua tech technology this is also kind of the stuff that they're doing to make the clear slabs um in the extraction machines and that's a different video so we won't bombard you with a bunch of information but i wanted to go back here now that you have the application down and can go back over it you can just disconnect this temperature probe and put you a glass funnel there and load in through there re-grease that temperature probe stick it back in there make sure you've got a good vacuum um you know being pulled down on your entire machine here uh you want to actually pack this with something like steel wool i like steel wool steel wool works i don't like the ones that have all the chemicals in them and stuff some of them have like dishwashing chemicals in there but if you can just find a steel packing wool that will go a long way for what you're trying to do here lee big condenser two nipples will be connected to your hot water circulator something like a julabo i know people that are even using rice cookers i mean hey whatever works for you uh to get this up to temperature and uh then you know your dry ice and your ethanol here so you'll load this up here's where you'll be adjusting your parameters for temperature and um you know if you've got the triple cal system you can just rotate this orb kind of lower this and uh relieve pressure here and then just spin that orb down into there um and just go ahead and leave that fraction up there because if you disconnect to collect your fraction then you might as well just be doing one fraction at a time and if you are doing that normally somewhere around here this one doesn't have it but you'll have a little vacuum sensor that'll be hooked up to one of these auxiliary ports that are hanging on around here but you can either close off um here the vacuum and then or here is where you'd have to close it off somewhere this system is not built up for it so i don't want to confuse you but um if you wanted to to shut that off and then bleed atmosphere into here while isolating this reaction that would be best then you could disconnect your fraction reconnect it grease it up reconnect it put it back get that pressure going here on your um on your support system and you can go ahead and open that up and allow the vacuum to pull it back through and you'll start collecting as normal normally i just bleed atmosphere into my vacuum sensor here or if i have like i said the vacuum attachment or the ptfe valve then i will just use that instead and yeah that is pretty much it now i wanted to get into packaging because a lot of people are putting their material their finished product in mason jars i mean they're great for that mason jars however uh you need to vacuum seal or nitrogen blanket your storage containers to remove any residual atmosphere inside of the material depending on the shelf life at a couple of weeks it won't hurt it too much however over months and months of it just being stored there you will start to establish what we call in the industry the red ring of death and that is actually oxygen if you ever notice any vacuum leaks in your short path and you'll notice like a blood orange type coloration happening around those leaks that's what it is and nobody wants to buy blood orange distillate especially when you're turning it clear right right we like the gold stuff we like the clear stuff we want it to look like money and make us money so i just wanted to put that little tip and trick in there uh thank you for watching this video make sure to reach out to us in the description you'll find links to our website you'll find links to our social media pages you can get our phone number off of there we'd love to have a conversation with you leave us a comment on how we can help you further educate you that's what we're here for and we will see you next time i believe that next we are going to be talking about vacuum oven technology in uh the bho and pho extraction area so it's exciting share this with your friends make sure that they get a hold of it and we will see you next time have a great day and be blessed", "SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "xBtFzL9BfHE": "what's up everyone this beautiful crazy as in we are looking green Wow [Music] this [Music]

doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah this cart definitely tastes like some sauce I feel like if I'm hitting a puff coal or a rig on very low temp settings I can taste the gelato very good flavor no breath inhale very smooth I'm not sure what I caught I think that was just mean but very tasty pretty pretty

a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "HxbthKzHWNE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another fake cartridge video I recently came across this fake cartridge if you're curious about the title about fake cartridges evolving let me get to that first of all my homie my homie comes up to me and asked me if this cartridge was legit or not not like actually physically coming up to me but like through a facebook Messenger and this brand the so-called brand that he brings up is can i clear he tells me that the oil was slightly pinkish which was like a red flag right off the bat you know you never oil that's pinkish come on like bias the the branding question is called can you clear and why ice titled this video fake cartridges are evolving I mentioned it in my lives recently so if you guys were in there you probably know what I'm talking about but basically when you think about fake cartridges you think about think face or supreme babes and a really good indicator of them being fake is that they're using copyrighted material maybe like cartoon characters from a beloved cartoon series or smartcards you know taking a brand's name and running with it with their own thing you know basically taking the brands likeness and applying it to themselves anything with Bank faves just their names already give off a red flag but this one can a clear I'll post it right here it's probably the most out of all the fake cartridges the most legit looking and I'd like to mention that you can just tell by the box shape that is very similar to the box shape of dang babes mind you that the packaging outside appearance is different it's still the same box shape everything's still the same and before I start this any further I do not have never tried a canna clear I've never heard of canna clear some people probably would assume that maybe it's a real brand then then they kind of just you know the black market kind of just took their name and went with it in the into the black market that could be the case but as far as I know my friend came up to me with candy clear said it was pinkish oil and it was like 30 bucks okay first of all you know I told him go to the club you know you can get a cartridge from the club for $30 now you know I'll be it's not gonna be we're all guarding quality but it's still gonna be good I got the free cannabis cart for 2350 at one point you know I just want to make this video you know I know a lot of this debate related deaths have actually been slowing down now that coronavirus has been here I don't know if that's uh actually like you know goes together in any way but I'm pretty late with this because I went to read it and they said kind of clear six months ago was faked so this is something new to me like I said my friend brought it to me I was unaware of a brand like this existed I know there's other brands out there but I feel like this one is probably the most dangerous one because it's it looks [ __ ] legit you know so as I'd like to just make this video and you know tell you guys let you guys know beforehand like myself you know I'm know probably some of you guys have probably heard of this brand already but like I said I only heard about it just a few weeks ago and I figured some people are like me as well and don't know about this brand so it's good to spread awareness for those of you who tried canna clear let me know your opinions in the comments down below you know did you have a good experience where'd you get it from did you get it from the club but just be aware you know that there are fakes out there and that's the thing when it comes to fakes you know it really just makes you paranoid it's kind of like this whole coronavirus thing where you don't know who has it you know and I don't know it's just just be aware guys you know I'm not saying all of them are bad but like I said there's fakes out there what raw garden is kind of different because raw garden if you go to a legit Club you don't have to worry about fakes at all you know so I know some dispensaries have had fake cartridges and I would assume that those dispensaries were either non licensed dispensaries or that they were just ignorant to the fact that maybe they just bought stuff thinking that it was real you know but like I said can I clear it's crazy it's dangerous you know I'm saying can it clear it's a very dangerous fake black-market cartridge because like I said it is it looks legit you know it really does but like I said the box shape is still the same as database very same [ __ ] all you're gonna see pink oil I mean need i say more oh yes I'm gonna take a sip of this t be aware of can of clear guys okay so if you enjoyed the video or if this helped you in any way you know please feel free to like it if you want you know I'm saying but other than that have a nice day [Music]", "evWCqaf4EX4": "hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks

subscribe", "t5Mtbx-W0D4": "hey guys dr. Shawn Mira vici here and I'm gonna do another cannabis product review for you despite all the craziness happening in the world right now with Koba 19 I'm practicing very strict social distancing but that doesn't mean I can't keep doing product reviews for you so today we have the another vape cartridge product using the 510 thread system today is going to be the sundial Zen very also known as shish kebob and so this comes from sundial growers they're based in Alberta some things of note about this company is that they really emphasize that they're putting out pure products meaning that they're free from additives fillers and artificial flavorings so you know you're getting a really pure product they do a glass and ceramic cartridge so a very high quality cartridge and they use single strain extracts so it's kind of like a single malt scotch meaning that your extracts just coming from one strain rather than a mix of different strains a lot of the other cartridges out there are really a mix of a bunch of different strains so kind of cool that this is a single strain extract it comes in at around 72 to 82 percent THC meaning that it's very strong THC level it's available on the Ontario cannabis store retailing for about 49 actually it's exactly forty nine ninety-five putting it into sort of the middle midpoint range in terms of price for for a vape cartridge but I don't mind paying a little bit extra if I'm getting a really good quality product so let's open it up it's also got a sort of a unique box most of the other fake cartridges I've received come in this paper box this one is this plastic round container and you open up by you see those notches you match up the notches there and then you pull it open or at least you try to pull it open yeah there we go okay let's pull it out you could take a look at that looks really nice it's got their logo there a nice glass container and the tip feels really nice too so you could tell it's high-quality and that just fits into your 510 cartridge battery system you screw that in there okay and then you're ready to go one thing I also wanted to mention about this particular strain is that they're terpene profile includes cario Filene Mersin and humulin and alluding to its name they say that you're gonna get like a nice sort of berry flavor with this vapor and I agree so you'll notice like it doesn't really taste obviously like berries but there is sort of this hint of barrenness in the flavor i had previously ordered the aurora indica cartridge and that was just like really just straight-up like cannabis ii flavor this one definitely has a hint of barrenness to it so i've been using this for the past three four days not a huge long time but but I do like the vapor it's nice and smooth it's got that sort of berry finish to it it is quite strong and it's a creeper meaning that you don't really feel this one right away it sort of creeps up on you after about 10 minutes so definitely go slow with this one because it will sort of creep up the effects and they are quite strong so it is quite calming it hits Li you like in a whole body way but it's very short-lived like it only lasts 60 to 90 minutes and then you kind of feel a little sleepy afterwards so I wouldn't recommend this as a daytime strain definitely best suited for evening nighttime use and that's really what I've noticed about this product is that it's strong but the effects wear off quite quite soon after so like an hour to an hour and a half taking all of those factors into account so you know a good quality product stressing that it's added to three which you know is what I want in a vape cartridge it it's that single strain all around like a high quality product but the effects are short-lived and the price is sort of mid to high range so taking all those into consideration I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 good product a couple limitations with it but but there you have it the sundial Zen berry thanks

down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this video I apologize for that but give the video a thumbs up comment like subscribe like that's [ __ ] you really know what to do spend your money ready peace out", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "FyOS9k4HIQc": "what is up guys I got one of my new favorite strains I got point six left I had a gram and it is lemon Sour Diesel this is the most flavorful medicine I've ever had that doesn't make you sick I've had some really flavorful medicine that if you do too much but it makes you sick the terpenes are just too strong this gives you all the flavor but doesn't make you sick which is very important with lemon Terps what I find out that's my personal belief some of the limited Terps can be overpowering we got a fourth Baker I don't know how hard to hit you though that seems good all right so it's like 34 degrees right now haha so I gotta put this into the banger yeah it's already cooled down [Music] [Music] [Music] Wow [Music] okay Lemon so purely notes but a very like briny lemon Rainey lemon flavoring more right than lemon that feels good that's all I need guys that's why I like this so much see I'll show you get them blah blah [Music] nothing at noon is right good hop should I do another one guys I'll do another one for video sake normally I wouldn't I want to try a different rig but it's too cold for this little rig this now close off fast so I got to do the banger alright let's do it again I'm gonna try and do it a little bit more smoothly this time but I'm new to the banger and this destroy it so hold the [ __ ] excuses [Applause] I'm new to daddy that's the main thing it's still gorge shouldn't hit it with orange right there's a puddle in ooo see that that is effective I think I might pick up more of that but I would I don't think I want to do it though [Music] nothing a little bit so yeah I'm tapped out now two damns so that's the end of the movie guys peace", "oC1aQnM1UIA": "a min of vaping health scare the new hope police chief announced a record seizure of illegal vaping cartridges that contained the active ingredient in marijuana the bust happened in [ __ ] Rapids but was announced in New Hope because the lead investigator on the case is a new hope officer that officer was part of the Northwest Metro drug task force which sees 75 thousand vaping cartridges that contain potent levels of THC many of the cartridges were marketed toward younger users with names on packages like fruity pebbles and strawberry shortcake authorities say using illegal THC cartridges can be very dangerous because the ingredients aren't always clear I want to urge all parents have conversations with your kids your loved ones anybody that you know that are using these cartridges stop using them get help go to treatment have conversations about the dangers these types of products are available for purchase in supplier states that have already passed law as legalizing recreational marijuana if you think this is a problem now wait until cannabis products become commercially available in Minnesota this is yet another example of why we should pause take our time before passing similar laws in the state currently there are more than 500 people in the US with serious lung injuries because of vaping and that number is expected to grow", "QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "1vjaYwXw8Pg":

cartridges from black tie CBD no terpenes or cutting agents have been added to this at all they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and these effects come on instantly as do most vaping products for me and I would find this particular cartridge to be a hair on the night time you can't I wouldn't reach for this during the day for whatever reason so that mellows me out nighttime cartridge hit me with the comment below if you've tried these let me know what you think peace [Music] [Music]", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "NV58V74weB4": "hi guys so I see I looked everywhere online I looked everywhere on forms a YouTube how to take the snap on tips off the C cell carts right I can't see that but uh so yeah they don't twist off like a normal twist they just snap just take a pair of vise grips right close it down you want to make sure the vise grips are on the mouthpiece itself not the middle bracket right so then you want to take another pair of pliers if you're gonna reuse the automatic oil don't grab the threads could\u00edve - stripling so there's a grab brave bout here on the band's and there's a wiggle the vamp comes off that's how you do it simple as that", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]"}
