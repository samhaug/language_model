Today we're making peanut butter cookies. So simple, so irresistible. Let's get started. I'm making these cookies\nfor my kid's babysitter. She loves peanut butter, so I thought, what better create than\npeanut butter cookies that I can send her home\nwith at the end of the night, and hopefully she enjoys them. All right, 180 grams of\nall-purpose flour into a bowl. I'm going to sift it up and whisk it up, but you don't have to, whisking is fine. So now, three quarters of\na teaspoon of baking powder and half a teaspoon of salt. This is sea salt. You could use kosher salt. I prefer you don't use iodized\nsalt, it's a little harsh. All right, I'll take the scale away, I know it bothers you. Oh my gosh, where'd all this\nflour come from? (laughs) Sift, sift, sift. I feel like that flour appeared\non the counter by magic like some dragon come out of the fire. Okay, clean our mess up\nand then set it aside. Now for the non-dry ingredients. I'm going to add one half of a cup... Now for the dry ingredients, I'm adding in half of a cup of unsalted, room temperature butter and\none cup of peanut butter. So one cup of peanut butter, in you go. Not messy at all, right? Mix it up, just to combine it a bit first. (mixer turns on) Okay, that's nice and delicious looking. By the way, this is great on\ntoast as is, just saying that. One half of a cup of\npacked light brown sugar, packed just means you tamp it down a bit because the sugar can kind\nbe a bit spacey in between, like me on any day ending in Y. Okay, then half a cup of\nwhite sugar, in you go. We're going to mix this up now until it's combined, little fluffy. (mixer turning off) All right,\nlet's scrape the bowl down with out peanut butter encrusted spatula. I was making this recipe\nyesterday as a run through and also to do all my still photography and today all of the cameras\nsmell like peanut butter. Okay. Now we're going to add that egg in. (cracks egg) (mixer turns on) No shells. Mix it up. Right, I'm adding in a spalsh of vanilla. You can let me know in the comments if you know what video that's from. Okay, a delicious, anytime treat, but we're going to add some\nflour to it and bake it up. Actually I never whisked up my flour. I can't do anything right. All right, whisk, whisk, whisk,\nwhisk, whisk, whisk, whisk. Okay, let's add that flour in and mix it up on low. (mixer turns on) There we go. Increase speed. Scrape it down. There's a lot of things\nhanging around in here. If you want to see a similar cookie, check out my chocolate\nchip peanut butter cookies. The recipe's a bit different, but they are like peanut butter,\nchocolate, salt cookie dreams. All right, mix it up a little bit more. (mixer turns on) Okay, so the cookies can\nbe any size you want. If you'd like them nice and uniform, how about two tablespoons or 40 grams. Give that a nice little roll. Roll, roll, roll into a ball,\ndoesn't have to be perfect. We're going to be smooshing\nit down with a fork. This was actually one of\nthe very first recipes I did on preppykitchen.com. You can click up here to see it. The original version was\nthe really really basic peanut butter cookie with no flour. Just peanut butter, sugar, egg, I think and I made a marshmallow\nsandwich with them with marshmallow fluff, it was cool. It was one of the things that did well, and I was like, \"Oh my\ngosh, this amazing.\" It got a few shares on\nFacebook and I was so excited. Just keep going, scooping up that dough, around 40 grams. Should get about 18 to 20\ncookies from this batch, depending on the size, time\nof day, et cetera, et cetera. When your balls of dough\nare all rolled out, you're going to get a\nfork, a big one please, and for the traditional\npeanut butter cookie, you make a crosshatch. So press down one, slide it out. And press down two. That's all there is to it. If you want it to be less cracked, you can tamp it down a bit first, then press down, slide that fork out, press down and slide the fork out. If you want to see what\na crazy person does to get them to look\nperfect, let me show you. Skewers. So, take two skewers. You're going to cut them in half. Now, you can simulate the tines of a fork. This took much longer to do. I have a set of these for a photography that I made yesterday, but I wanted to show you in\ncase you were ever wondering kind of randomly like, \"How do they do it? Mine look all cracked and weird.\" Okay, so here we go, see that? Press down. Remove. And then press down in the other way. You can tape these together\nso you're not holding them in this weird fashion. There we go. Is it worth the extra effort? I don't know, but I did it (laughs). But for now, the fork works fine. You can put it back together\nif it falls apart a bit, unlike poor Humpty Dumpty. I feel like they don't mention\nthat Humpty Dumpty is an egg. \"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,\" doesn't say he's an egg. Some guy named Humpty Dumpty (laughs). Clearly, I've been reading\ntoo many Buzzfeed listicles. You can let me know in the comments if you're guilty of this as well, or if I'm just a sad basic monster. Okay, these look nice,\nperfectly homemade and smashed. They're going to go into the oven at 350 for nine to ten minutes. You don't want them to burn. They're going to kind of stay light, but then firm up as they cool down. So you have to leave them\non the cooling rack, no. You have to leave them on the baking try until they firm up basically. Okay, into the oven. Cookies are out of the\noven and cool to touch. Which one do you like better? Let me know in the comments. My fancy skewer version\nwhere I faked the fork, or the actual fork one where it looks a little bit more rustic and homemade. I kind of like both, although, I don't know, there's something about this that's appealing to the\ninner double Virgo in me. That has all the peanut\nbutter flavor you could want, just the right amount of sweetness. It's like a soft, chewy cookie. It has that peanut butter, fall\napart in your mouth feeling, if you know what I mean, it's really good. If you like these cookies,\ncheck out my cookie playlist I made just for you.

everyone welcome back to cooking with donna today we're going to be making up some peanut butter cookies soft peanut butter cookies and for the life of me i just i don't understand what happened here i could have swore i had already done a peanut butter cookie and then somebody requested one and i thought let me go back and look and sure enough i never never uploaded it so i'm gonna do one today this is my favorite one i've been making this one up for for a long time it's always my go-to one so let me go ahead and share the one i like to use okay first i'm gonna get me one cup of soft butter real butter i always say that real butter when it comes to baking cookies cakes i'm always using real butter and i always use um salted butter now by all means use unsalted that way you control your salt but me i use salted butter you know for lots of things you know your everyday things and i like salt salted butter so that's what i'm using it's two sticks which equals one cup and then to my one cup of butter i'm going to be putting in one and a quarter cups of packed brown sugar and 1 4 cup of white sugar i had in there all right okay so that's one and a quarter packed brown sugar one and a quarter cups and then one quarter cup of white granulated and i'm just going going to mix this all up till it's nice and creamy we'll just get this mixed up just until it's all all together maybe a minute i've been beating that for about a minute just by hand now to that i'm going to get my peanut butter let me see here my peanut butter we're going to add in is one and one third cups of creamy peanut butter that's one and one-third cups well actually i'm gonna get my eggs in first there's one egg just do one at a time they mix in better that way these are some good pillowy soft peanut butter cookies and there's my second egg and i have two teaspoons of vanilla see the vanilla go flying okay can you guys see that or am i getting too far of the picture for you get that all mixed up good get that egg in there all right now we can add our peanut butter and that's one and one-third cups of creamy peanut butter if you like a soft a soft um peanut butter cookie with a really good flavor you're gonna love these ones but the most important thing that i have to bring up to you about these cookies is you don't over bake them you can't over bake them if you over bake them it changes the whole cookie these cookies bake probably between eight to ten minutes and no longer because if you over bake them like i said you done ruined them because they're gonna continue to cook once you take them out with all that brown sugar and all that butter that's in there they're gonna seem like they're they're not done but it's very important to to take them out let them set up let them set and you'll be rewarded they're a delicious cookie just do not over bake them you'll love them get that mixed in all that brown sugar butter good cookie okay now just like my other cookies i just mix everything up on top here i have two and a half cups of bread flour now bread flour gives you a better chew to your cookie so i like to use bread flour and that's two and a half cups of bread flour and on top of that a quarter teaspoon of salt because i did use salted butter and if you're not using salted butter i would go with a half a teaspoon and three quarter teaspoons of baking soda not baking powder baking soda i always throw that in there because a lot of people confuse that so it's baking soda the yellow box and just gently mix it right on top there just like that and preheat your oven to 350. i am so bad at that god i always tell myself when you start the video donna let them know first off that's the first thing i should be telling you get your oven preheated i always seem to forget and i apologize for that you guys all right so yeah get that oven preheated and get your cookie sheet ready i like to line mine with parchment paper so i'm just gonna get this mixed in but it's very important that you do not over mix this you want it just until it comes together don't beat it all up or anything then what i'm gonna do is um you know what that's why i told i said not to preheat the oven because this dough needs to be chilled so we're going to be chilling our dough so yeah don't you don't got to preheat the oven i even turned mine on i always forget about the chilling part so yeah we're going to be chilling this dough so i'm gonna get it mixed up i'm gonna put it in the in the freezer probably about 45 minutes if you're gonna put it in the frigerator maybe an hour and a half but i like to put it in the fridge so i'll get it in the freezer chilled for about an hour and we'll get them in the oven i wanted to show for the ones that are not sure just kind of fold it over on itself don't don't beat it up just until you see that flower disappear you're done mixing and we are just about there all right that's it in the freezer it goes i'm going to put some saran wrap over it one hour alrighty guys about maybe 10 minutes before your dough your cookie dough is ready go ahead and get that oven preheated to 350. now i wanted to bring up earlier and i kept telling myself don't forget to tell them don't forget to tell them when you make your cookies please always measure your flour um it's very important when it comes to baking because if you over pack your flower cup that one cup level and you pack it you're not getting proper measurements so therefore you're getting more flour than the recipe calls for so spoon it in with a spoon then level it off with like a kitchen knife that way you're not packing it spoon it in there and fluff your flour up real good before you dip that cup in there if you're going to do it that way you know you can dip your flour you dip it in there that way but fluff your flour up real good and then lightly pack your cup don't don't pack it it's very important to to to measure right when it comes to cookie baking if you want a a good cookie but anyway i needed to throw that in there for you guys but my dough chilled for 35 minutes because i put it in the freezer now if you're going going to put it in the refrigerator like say ah that's cookie dough i'm gonna put it in there it's gonna be in there for hours and hours and then you decide i'm gonna just cook it like that roll them and then cook them it's not gonna be the same because then your dough is way too cold and your cookies gonna require longer baking and you're not gonna you're gonna get a very um well it's to be a cookie that's not going to spread much at all so it's going to change the cookie so you're basically looking just to just to because when you when you make the dough it's a little too sticky shall i say to roll into a bowl and now that it's chilled for 35 minutes see i can make a ball out of that now i'm gonna do about maybe a good sized tablespoon and i'm gonna roll it into a ball and i'm going to roll it into some sugar just roll it into your sugar and then i'm going to place it over here on my parchment paper lined sheet there and i'm gonna bake these it they take between eight to ten minutes like i said probably about a tablespoon on each one here a good size tablespoon and they're gonna bake up nice and soft and pillowy and just yummy but like i said it's important to let them sit as they come out and they will firm up because like i said they're gonna look like they're under done they're not they're almost like a not caramel inside not nothing like that but it's just got that that soft um that soft texture that you look for in a nice good peanut butter cookie these are really they're addicting and you're not just gonna eat one i guarantee that but i'm gonna get these in the oven guys 350 between eight to ten minutes our ovens vary they're not gonna brown much because these cookies just don't you know but they're packed with flavor don't over bake them all right got them all on there i got 12 of them on there um but like i was saying on if you plan on leaving the dough in the refrigerator for a very long time your dough is going to get too cold and too stiff so bring it to room temperature i don't know if i brought that up i wanted to bring that up let it come to room temperature whenever you can roll it to a soft ball not no hard ball you want it to be you know kind of somewhat still a little bit sticky but enough to roll and they'll be good so they're going in the oven guys hey guys there they are mine cooked for the first batch took nine minutes the second batch took almost nine minutes so your oven you know keep an eye on them i got 32 cookies okay and it's very important guys to let these cookies cool and let them let let them set up because if you eat them hot they're not they're not gonna do well you need to let the cookie set up and let it take shape and you'll be rewarded um and tracy these are for you she requested them uh like i said i thought i had one up and i went and looked and i didn't have one so i wanted to get this up because she she asked me to if i could post one tracy i hope you enjoy these and give them a try and let me know what you guys think but until next time you guys stay safe out there and enjoy the cookies and please like and subscribe as always god bless you", "c4l9IsHg1-I": "[Music] hi guys so welcome to Diamond delight animals my name is Liz if this is the first time you're stopping by and for the rest of you guys welcome back so today I'm going to show you a great recipe pretty much most you guys will have these ingredients at home your classic peanut butter recipe crab peanut butter cookies mother so yeah I tasted one the food so check these out so it's not nice check that out and then these I just did is a pinwheel kind of decoration for Halloween I thought would be fun so I'll show you how to do that if you'd like and yeah let's just jump right into those ingredients and get started oh one day I want to say it's what's nice about this recipe is you can use it with a variance of great ingredients I'll get more into that with the ingredients but if you've got cannabutter can of sugar can of flour can is shortening pretty much you can use any one or all of those combinations so as I said this is a great recipe to do simple easy no major equipment involved you know who said easy ingredients so let's get started alright so for our peanut butter cups what we are going to need is a half a cup of peanut butter now what I would recommend is all-natural peanut butter because that way you don't have as much sugar and some of you have no sugar and that's added salt to it and you're gonna have a much nicer tasting peanut cookie versus the commercial but if that's what you got no problem at all but like I said the old Naturals nice way to go with that because we do add all that other sugar so not necessarily needed in your peanut butter so I'll start again here so we'll go 1/2 a cup of peanut butter a quarter cup of shortening now I did Kanna infused shortening so that's what I'm using here a quarter cup of butter unsalted butter now you can use cannabutter obviously so 1/4 cup of can of that's what you've got one egg and you'd like it you want your egg at room temperature because if you had a very cold egg to butter it makes it go all lumpy and you don't want that in your cookies you're going to want a half a cup of brown sugar a half a cup of white sugar granulated white sugar or if you've got Candida like I've got I did a quarter cup of canna and a quarter cup of white then you want three quarters of a teaspoon of baking powder sorry baking soda I always confuse those two we've got about three-quarters of a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and then you want one and a quarter cups of flour then really for equipment just a hand mixer stand mixer you can absolutely do this by hand parts lined cookie sheet one of these scoops make it really nice so you can make nice even cookies spatula and that's about it and what I'm gonna try want to try and see if I can do some Halloween coloured one so I want to do black and orange see if I can do them in as a pinwheel not sure if it'd work out but we'll find out together and other than that let's get started all right so the first thing we're gonna add is our butter and sugar and get those blended together so we're going to use our peanut butter and our butter and our shortening that's my peanut butter i quarter cup of shortening quarter cup of butter and you want to make sure that the butter and the shortening or at room temperature and we're going to put in our half a cup of packed brown sugar and our half a cup of where my quarter can and my quarter white sugar or you just a half a cup of white sugar and attached our paddle and get those blended together first OOP salsify plug it in electricity is an important thing so I'm just gonna blend that I'm excited until it's all well blended together and then we're going to add our room temperature a scrape down four inches I'm so not a neat person out of her egg and I will just get that blended in just scrape down your edges and now we're going to add in our salt baking soda and baking powder I like to blend those together before adding in the flour so that way to make sure that they get well blended and not get clumped into the flour [Music] he don't do that turn the blender off the mixer off and once that's well mix we're going to add in our flour and again we're just going to blend this tool that gets mixed together and becomes a dough [Music] clean off our side make sure your bowl is attached reattach my bowl scoop that down just gonna give it a final blend get everything front mixed together hopefully my ball will stay attached they kind of bent it making bagels one day you're not really supposed to need bagels in this so when you're when you're up if you know it starts to come together like this it's all coming together nicely and a taker get some saran wrap and we're just gonna put this in the fridge to chill for one to two hours or until it's firm so this is what your dough should basically be looking like mmm nice and pliable now what I'm gonna do cuz I said I'm gonna try that experiment I'm gonna split half of my dough I'm gonna do my colors and let them set separately and yeah I'm gonna try the pinwheel thing so just make sure to wrap it up really well and put that into the refrigerator for one to two hours I still sit until it's firm all right so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna split these I have no idea if the color is gonna take or not we're gonna find out really quick so I've used I'm using oil base colors but I'm sure gel colors would work just as well just trying to get this need to get the color needed in yeah many is parties so I'm just working this tool it all becomes an even color now you don't have to wait well I'm get it fully even because as it sets the color will spread out try the orange you probably rubber gloves or plastic gloves would be better doing this but of course I wouldn't think that ahead of time again I'm just gonna need this until the color all it gets worked through there we go Sunday's kind of pumpkin orange happenin now I'm gonna put these two sets think I'm gonna roll them out first a lot I think that might work better because they're more pliable now and then how lose sets that way so I'm gonna just set this aside did you use two pieces of saran wrap grab my rolling pin now this rolling pin is awesome because you put the disks on it and it'll roll it to exactly that size so they're like an eighth of an inch quarter or half inch it's really nice for those of us who cannot roll straight one do the orange then I'm gonna take the black one hey if I took off the top layer of my black player there and I'm gonna try and very gently lay this on top of the orange it is very delicate well I didn't work out according to plan that's okay we can fix it doesn't need to be pretty and then tossed it back on top here and you want to be very gentle so to roll you want to have keep it on the Saran wraps on the back and you roll it with the saran wrap kind of like doing a great role in a great big you-know-what and as you work just pull the plastic away it doesn't have to be that pretty just want to get it together because we're going to let that set in the fridge want to make sure it's together it's good rolled in the plastic even around a little bit we take the ends like that wisdom and it loose that's not making a sausage I'm going to put that in the fridge to set for when I meet with the other dough there and we'll be back and we'll cut these up and portion out the our cookies alright flora dough is ready we're gonna preheat our oven to 350 degrees and we're gonna set up our cookies and get them beat alright so aren't cookie dough with that so I like I'd like to use the small scoop not the smallest percolated I guess I don't know small medium scoop this way it gives us the perfect size and so just grab a scoop of your dough even or all you want to make sure that they're nice all evenly on the same side now I've got one of these baking mats and I'm going to try half with the parchment paper and half of the baking mat I want to see if it makes any difference see if this because the mats are supposed to bake them better so we'll find it so you're just gonna scoop that out and then once you got all your little balls on there for your closet peanut butter recipe just take your pork go down one way oops that was in the way and then just crisscross you just want to make sure to have enough space between them because they will spread out baby 1 now you do check out the pinwheels let's hope this work alright just gonna get a knife so you can use one of these straightedge cutter or source straightedge night first just take the end off I got nothing in there Oh check that out let's see how they bake up all right so we're gonna pop these toughest into the oven in your preheated oven of 350 and for 8 to 12 minutes or until they are lightly golden brown and I just want to pick up any any of the excess cookie just stick it back on if there is and we'll be back shortly and see how these puppies come out so ten minutes I check out my cookies so you want that I said just that nice light golden brown and we're gonna let those cool so I'm just gonna slide these over very gently to a cooling rack over here and we're just gonna let these cool for

classic peanut butter cookie that's soft and chewy this cookie reminds me in school time I remember cafeteria peanut butter cookies so this is the closest recipe that I found to that taste that I remember from school days so if you'd like to come along for the journey with me in making this classic chewy peanut butter cookie then let's go ahead and get started okay YouTube first of all we're going to add in one stick of butter that's at room temperature and then we're going to add in our sugar this is 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and then also 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar like brown sugar actually and then we have our peanut butter that we will add we have everything in there we're going to mix this on low well first let's stir get everything going and then we'll speed it up a little bit I'm gonna stop this for just a moment and then scrape down my bowl and then we will start it back [Applause] okay now we're going to stop and we're going to add in our egg we have one egg here that we will add in and then we're going to also add in our vanilla extract and we have two teaspoons of vanilla extract and we'll give this a go again all right that looks gorgeous and now we're going to add in our dry ingredients we have one and a half cups of flour then we have one teaspoon of baking soda and one quarter teaspoon of sea salt I'm going to start this off on just a stir to not throw too much flour in the air now we're going to amp it up a little ok looks like we got a pretty good dough here perfect alright now we're ready to place our cookie dough batter onto our baking sheet and I'm going to use my cookie scoop here now that we have all the cookies scooped out I'm going to take each one and smooth out these rough edges that you see by rolling the dough in my hands now that we have a cookie dough smooth now I like to go ahead and press down each cookie and I just take two fingers and just press down each one before doing the crisscross pattern with the fork and now they're ready to go into the oven 350 degrees for about 10 minutes and then we will bring them back out all right YouTube we've got the first batch out of the oven you can see those really good there and I'm going to let these cool for a little bit on this baking pan and then I'll move them to my wire rack used to see right back there in the corner to allow them to cool completely alright YouTube I am back with the peanut butter cookie this one is hot out of the oven I cook these for about 10 minutes and then just until the outside the outer edge started to brown and then I took them out so that they can remain really soft and chewy even when they cool down so let's let's take a bite oh wow excellent cooking definitely can taste that peanut butter of course then I can pick up on that sea salt good contrast with the sweetness of the pinky and also that vanilla extract in here and that light brown sugar one more box all I need is a glass of milk with this whole milk 2%

They have the perfect\namount of everything. They're basically fool-proof. And I don't know if you can\nsee, but there's this sparkle of giant flakes of sea salt on top and it is making all of your\ncookie dreams come true. You gotta believe me on this. Okay, let's get started. First off, we're gonna\nsift the dry ingredients starting with 2-1/4\ncups or about 270 grams of all-purpose flour. There we go. It's close. 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda. I'm adding in 1/2 a teaspoon of salt now, but we're gonna garnish this cookie with beautiful flakes\nof sea salt at the end so you will get a nice, salty finish. Sift it up (upbeat music) and give it a quick whisk. Okay, now we can set that\naside and get onto the butter, and peanut butter, and\nall that gooey goodness. Into the bowl of my stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment I'm adding in one cup, which is two\nsticks, or about 230 grams of unsalted room-temperature butter. In you go. Cream it up for like a few seconds. Now we're gonna add in a cup and 1/2 of smooth peanut butter. And I will give you some advice. Use the regular, like supermarket brand. It has a lot of emulsifiers\nand other ingredients in there that'll make it a bit more stable. This is gonna be a little\nsoupy, but it'll all work out, so don't worry. And by my measurement, a\ncup and 1/2 of peanut butter is about 260 grams. Okay, mix. I would eat this just like that, like with a spoon. That is some delicious business. Okay, so thanks to my\nglass bowl, you can see there's a little bit of\nbutter at the very bottom. Just scrape it down. This recipe uses 3/4 of a\ncup of light brown sugar, so just tap it down. You're actually packing it a little bit. Lightly packed brown sugar. And then 2/3 of a cup of granulated sugar. So in you go. You might know this, but white sugar will make the cookies spread out more and the brown sugar will\nmake it a little bit (sighing) cakier. No! (off-air beep) Cakier. No one saw that. Mix it. It'll get a little bit\nlighter and fluffier. The peanut butter is\nweighing it down, though. If you make peanut butter\ncookies, you know this already, but adding more peanut\nbutter will increase the peanut butter flavor\nand also make them, like, just super crispy like they're\ngonna dissolve in your mouth. Less peanut butter,\nclearly less the flavor, but the cookies will\nbe a bit stronger, too. Less crumbly. (mixer motor) Okay, take a look. A little bit lighter in color. Little creamier. Mm. Now we're gonna add in two\nteaspoons of vanilla extract, one large egg to start. Mix 'er up and then we'll\nadd in the second large egg. Gonna scrape the bowl down really quickly and then we can add\nour dry ingredients in. And this cookie's almost ready to eat. Now, add your dry ingredients in. You can do it, you can do it all at once. Good. Mix on low until you're confident bad things won't happen. Okay, look at that. Now it's a dough. But what could make this even better? How 'bout some chocolate chips? I'm adding a cup and 1/2 of semi-sweet chocolate chips in. If you want to use milk\nchocolate, that's on you. I will have the dark. I'm gonna mix this for like a few seconds and then fold it in by hand. (mixer motor) (light-hearted music) Okay. Oh my, this smells so good. In fact, let's take a little test. Oh man. It's so good. So good! Oh, okay. This will be delicious. And I'll be right back with the swap out that I made yesterday. All right, back with my chilled dough and I'm using a regular-size\nice cream scoop. I'll measure it out in a second in grams in case you're a Virgo like me and you like things to be exact. Just scoop out the chilled dough, pop it out, and then\nwe have about 50 grams. Look at this. Where are my chocolate chips? They're all hiding inside. But don't worry. We're gonna fix it and\nmake it look really cute. Just continue. You want to space them out. They will be spreading. So I like to do kind of\nrows of two or three. So these cookies are a mixed bunch. Some of them are covered in chocolate. Some of them have almost none. I want them to be uniform\nand look really pretty, so pop in a couple of\nchocolate chips to the top, maybe like three to\nfour, and just put them in different orientations. You can press a few in. The main thing is that you're gonna have some of the chocolate that's fully exposed and not covered with any batter, so it'll look nice and\nglossy once they bake. And no one ever sad, \"Too\nmuch chocolate,\" right? These cookies are looking way better, but for my final blogger\ntrick, I'm gonna use some Maldon sea salt. I'm not getting paid for this at all, so don't worry, it's not sponsored. But this salt is bananas. It has huge crystals in\nit which look beautiful on all sorts of dishes. Look at that salt crystal. It's like a giant roof\nshingle that's in this bag. And the science teacher in me loves seeing the crystalline structure. It's a, it's a, it's a pyramid. (chuckling) That's what it is. It's a regular, old, square pyramid. Okay, anyways, now we're\ngoing to gracefully add on just a sprinkle on top. The salt will not melt, so you'll have some beautiful flakes. And the other thing I like about this is it's paper thin. So even though the salt crystals are huge, you're not biting into\na giant chunk of salt. It really is a perfect\ncompliment for this recipe. All right, this is gonna go into the oven at 350, about 177 Celsius, for, mmm, maybe 13 to 15 minutes\nbecause you want them to start setting but not be fully baked. They're gonna spread out\nand they'll dome a bit, but once you take them out\nof the oven, they'll flatten and be a beautiful cookie\nwith a velvety finish. It'll be magic. Let's make this happen. But wait, there's more. Mm mm. (chuckling) I told you that if you\nuse more peanut butter, you get more flavor, but it is more, it doesn't have the structure. So it's a trade off. These are delicious, but they\nwill start falling apart, especially if you just\nhit them with a heat gun right before this shot because\nyou wanted the chocolate to look extra glossy in the closeup. If you like this video, check\nout my number-two-by-a-hair, these would be number\none, favorite cookie, chocolate chocolate chip. So delicious and good. And if you want the classics, chewy chocolate chips over here. Those are really like a crowd pleaser. But these guys are number one.

And happy baking.", "RgWeHeNb2hw": "hello this is chef john from food wishes comm with classic peanut butter cookies and by classic I mean no secret ingredients no new modern techniques just traditional old-fashioned cookie goodness and here's how you make them they're super easy all right into the bowl of our electric mixer we're going to add some room temperature butter some white sugar some packed brown sugar and of course peanut butter and I'm using the creamy style you can use chunky if you want and by the way you don't want any fancy peanut butter here I don't want to give the brand to the one I'm using but it's really fast to find in the supermarket in fact you'll find it in a jiffy I know that wasn't really a pun but we have to use that sound effect in a while and I missed it we're also going to add some salt some baking powder and baking soda alright so we're going to put on our paddle attachment and we're going to cream the butter and the peanut butter together with the sugars we're going to start slow so as not to have chunks of butter flying into our face but once it starts to cream together you can crank it up a little bit and in about a minute you should be looking at something like this alright so once that's all creamed together nicely we're going to take a spatula and scrape down the sides now if you want that job to be really annoying use a tiny freakishly small spatula like I have it will take forever so a little tip choose a bigger spatula than I did alright once that's all scraped down we're going to add one whole egg turn the mixer back on till that's mixed in same way start slow and high and that's only going to take about a minute to mix in oh and by the way one tip if you're making these in the kitchen where someone's making chocolate fudge cookies be really careful you don't bump into them anyway at that point we're going to add the last ingredient which is the flour so I'm going to dump it all in again we're going to start off on slow and when it looks like that it's not quite all mixed in you can still see some flour I'm going to stop it I'm going to scrape down the sides scrape down the paddle all right and then we're going to give this one last little quick mix and we don't want to over mix although that's not really a major issue with peanut butter cookie dough all right so once all that's cleaned up and scraped down I'm going to put the paddle back in and just give it a couple more turns alright just like that and that cookie dough is done all right so you're going to clean off your paddle of course you're going to scrape all the sides down form that into a nice ball of dough and then cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate this for at least two to three hours all right the longer the better you want this very very cold before we shape our cookies all right so find something to do for about three hours may I suggest a game of Monopoly so enter food wishes time machine it is now three hours later so I'm going to take a half sheet pan I'm going to cover it with my silicone baking mat I'm also going to take one of these sorbet scoop which I think makes forming the cookies really simple and not so much simple as it makes them all the same size all right now if you just want to go by eye and use a spoon and serve cookies that are different sizes like some savage go ahead but I think you should pick up one of these so your portions are nice and even and once they're scooped we're going to take that and with our palms we're going to roll that into a very smooth ball one tip if you put a little bit of water on your hands and they're a little bit damp you get a beautifully smooth surface so once your cookies are scooped rolled and placed on your cookie sheet the most fun part the old stamp of Stampa and to do the old Stamper Stamper you're gonna want to take a fork press it down into the cookie dough about half way down turn it and do the same thing 90 degrees that way and that's how you get the signature peanut butter cookie cross hatch mark by the way rumor has it that this crosshatch peanut butter cookie design actually gave those nerds at Twitter the idea for the hashtag I know hashtag OMG alright once your cookies have all gotten the old stamp of Stampa we're gonna put those in a 375 degree oven for 10 minutes and that's it look at that gorgeous traditional peanut butter cookies now I want you to let those sit on the hot pan for just five minutes and by that time they'll be just cool enough to transfer to your rack where they will sit until they're cool enough to eat and what does that mean oh that's up to you I believe they're at their ultimate awesomeness just slightly over room temperature just a touch warm but some people like them hot some people like them cold all right so whatever turns you on within reason and that's it what else can we say a delicious classic American cookie soft moist rich in the middle slightly crispy around the edges just a perfect combination of textures and that deep not too sweet very satisfying nutty flavor just a classic cookie lovers experience so if you've never made homemade peanut butter cookies before I hope you give these a try head over to food wishes calm for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual and as always enjoy", "Y7uUAVBOeY4": "what's up guys today I'm gonna show you how to make probably the easiest low-carb keto friendly peanut butter cookie recipe you could possibly make these cookies literally have only three ingredients guys and they're pretty much impossible to screw up the only way you can screw this up is if you leave them in the oven for just way too long like you forget you're baking cookies anyways let's get started let's get cookin guys alright so in a large bowl a very large bowl actually you want to add one cup of smooth natural no sugar added peanut butter next up you want to add one large egg to your bowl and the last ingredient we're gonna add is going to be some sugar substitutes so we're gonna add 1/2 a cup of some granulated erythritol now what you can do is take out your spatula and mix all the ingredients together until a thick cookie dough batter starts to form in the bowl once it does you can take out your cookie scoop and start scooping out some of that dough the recipe actually makes 12 equal sized cookies so you want to add each scoop to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and then once you've added all of your cookies to your baking sheet you want to bake them at 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes or until the edges are just starting to turn golden brown and of course if you want that classic peanut butter cookie texture on the tops of your cookies then you want to pull them out about 5 to 6 minutes into baking and then just take a fork and score the tops of them with your fork once you've scored all the cookies you can just slide them back in the oven and let them finish cooking for the final 5 to 6 minutes and then you want to pull them out and let them cool completely in the tray itself once they're cooled completely then you can transfer them to a plate and of course as always

for hanging out with me a little bit if you're not subscribed yet subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video [Music]", "prTNo6mytYw": "Today on The Stay at Home Chef I'm showing you how to make Five Ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies. These peanut butter cookies are so soft and delicious, and they only require five ingredients\nto make. You'll of course need peanut butter, and you want to make sure it's a\ncreamy kind. You'll also need granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and one egg. That's right, there is no flour in this recipe. None needed, no substitutions needed. There's just no flour required to make a\npeanut butter cookie. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees, and you'll want to line a baking sheet with either parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, if you don't have parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, you can lightly grease the\nbaking sheet. But for better results use parchment paper or the baking mat. We need to measure out one cup of peanut butter, and it helps if you lightly\ngrease your measuring cup. Then we can scoop our peanut butter in to measure it, and it'll come out a ton easier. Then we'll plop this into a medium sized\nmixing bowl, and you can see it actually comes out pretty well. Then we'll add in half a cup of granulated sugar and half a cup of brown sugar, and then we're gonna cream this together for about two to three minutes, until it's nice and smooth. You want the peanut butter and sugar to be really well mixed. Then we'll add in one egg, get that in there, and about one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and this is my homemade. And then we'll be able to mix this together until well combined. After about 30 to 60 seconds of mixing, you can see that the dough comes together, and can easily be shaped into a\nlittle dough ball. Pinch off about a heaping tablespoon of the dough, and you'll roll this quickly into a little ball, and place it onto your prepared\nbaking sheet. This recipe makes between 21 and 24 cookies, depending on the size that you made them. You can either use two trays or bake in batches, it doesn't really matter. Before baking you'll take a fork and gently press each cookie down, and I like to do a little criss-cross pattern. Once you have all of them smushed, we're gonna bake these in the 350 degree oven for about 8 minutes. Then you'll remove them from the oven and let them cool completely on the pan. Don't remove them from the pan until they're completely cooled, and that's it. You are ready to eat. You'll want to store your completely cooled cookies in an airtight container. They should stay good for about three to four days, but you're probably going to eat them all first because these are that good. Thanks for watching.

See you later.", "L99VTNbc1WE": "hey guys welcome to my Cinnabon recipe so we are going to start out by making your basic oopsie rolls by taking three eggs and separating the yolks and the whites and I'm going to show you how we create the oopsie roll and then turn it into a Cinnabon oh yes okay so basically what we have here our whites in a bowl and what we are going to do is add I think it's a half a teaspoon of cream of tartar this is what cream of tartar looks like if you're unfamiliar you get it down the spice or the baking aisle in your supermarket so half a teaspoon of this goes into the egg whites and then we're going to beat it into stiff peaks and I'll show you what that looks like in just a second this is just showing you what the cream of tartar looks like in the egg whites so I'm going to beat it up right now alright so I've whipped up these eggs and cream of tarter for a couple of minutes and I just want to show you this is what I mean by stiff peaks you see that there's no liquid left to the eggs and when you scoop it it's like a stiff consistency that's exactly what we want when I say stiff peaks okay so the next thing we're going to do is we are going to be adding to our three egg yolks we're going to be adding our stevia which we're going to use two packets of that we're going to use three ounces of cream cheese so yours cream cheese here's our stevia and we're also going to add a pinch of Himalayan salt to that and we're going to mix that up and I'll show you what that looks like in just a second so here it is three egg yolks three ounces of cream cheese two packets of stevia and some Himalayan salt now I'm going to mix this up into a cake batter consistency alright so there you have it the egg yolks cream cheese salt and stevia mixed into sort of like a cake batter consistency now what we're going to do is we're going to take these egg whites and we're going to gently put them into this bowl and then we are going to fold it in nice and delicately so let's get started on that alright so I put the egg whites in there and I forgot to mention that now is the time to sprinkle some ground cinnamon in this I mean this is to taste guys so you could do however much you like I like mine nice and cinnamony so that's what I put in and I am going to fold this together and incorporate it not mix it but fold it and that we do by taking the bottom and just folding it over folding it over and we're just going to keep doing that until it's incorporated and I'll show you what that looks like in just a second okay so it's nicely folded in here and you can still see it's still thick so what we're going to do is we're going to put this on to a cookie sheet which I already have lined up over here with parchment paper and we are going to build our Cinnabon rolls onto the parchment paper and I'm going to show you what that looks like in a minute because it's important to see how it's done all right this is what I wanted you to see I'm going to go to pan level if I can do you see how high in the pan I tried to make these they're not flat they're kind of you know puffy shape and the reason I like that is because it'll stay that way in the oven and it won't be pancake like so let's get this into a 300 degree oven for about 30 minutes and in the meantime we will start on our frosting while these are cooking all right so this is the icing and in this bowl I have four ounces of cream cheese 4 tbsp Kerry gold butter 4 packets of stevia half a teaspoon of vanilla half a teaspoon of cinnamon which I still have to put in there 1 tablespoon of heavy cream and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice so I'm going to put excuse me I'm going to put my 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon in there and I am going to mix it up and it will be a nice Cinnabon II glaze for our Cinnabon so let me get the cinnamon in here let me mix it and we will be putting together our Cinnabon here it is perfect now since we still have about 20 minutes left for these Santa bonds to cook I'm going to take this icing and I'm going to keep it in the refrigerator because when we put the nice cold icing on top of the warm cinnamon buns it will melt and drizzle all over the top just like a Cinnabon all right so I'm going to put this in the fridge and we will be back in 20 minutes to put these things together and I cannot wait guys YUM oh all right guys so 30 minutes is up here are the wall YUM what some people would call oopsy rolls in this case they're going to be Cinnabon rolls because they are loaded up with cinnamon oh my gosh guys if you can smell my kitchen right now you can actually see the little specks of cinnamon in there do you guys see that oh my gosh all right while they're warm I'm gonna ice them and show you our final product and let me tell you I am diving into one of these as soon as this video is done so let's get the icing out of the fridge and begin okay so here we go got the frosting out of the refrigerator and I'm going to take some on a knife gently bring it over here and how guys it literally just like melts on top and I don't even know what to say because my mouth is salivating so much this if you guys are familiar with what is it those like Pillsbury cinnamon rolls or whatever in the tub yeah and that tube you pop open and you make them in the oven and it always comes with that little container of icing that's exactly what this reminds me of and again yeah my mouth is watering guys this is like the easiest dessert and it is so ideal for those on keto because you know we don't want to dive into our kids Girl Scout cookies or you know on Halloween we don't want to dive into our kids candy and all that other stuff this is the perfect treat and this even is amazing in the morning for breakfast with a cup of coffee I'm not to say it is a really nice treat so I hope you guys take this recipe and run with it because it's delicious and at the end of this video I will have all of the nutritional information for you and so you guys know what each one of these consist of in regards to calories and your macros of fat and you know all of that ratio so anyway yeah I'm going to finish doing this guy's and I am going to Mon job on one of them now in case you're questioning or wondering how to store these I would definitely cover them with some plastic wrap whoops I can't get this out um and keep them in your fridge because remember this is butter and eggs and even though it's cooked the frosting um you know it has butter and stuff in it oh that one cracked a little bit but yeah definitely keep these in the refrigerator and you will have yourself a great treat in the morning if they're in the refrigerator as I was saying because my camera died in the morning these can easily be heated up in the microwave especially if they're coming out of the refrigerator so anyway guys I have this wonderful treat for yourself share it with your friends your family it is an outstanding keto dessert and again you can definitely increase or decrease the amount of cinnamon you can add different extracts I like vanilla in this you could use almond you could use mint if you like mint you could use anything so anyway I'm going to sign off because I am going to eat one of these and yeah look how delicious it's starting to melt just like a real Cinnabon haha alright guys I hope you loved it and I

going to be making peanut butter cookies one with five ingredients and one with ten ingredients one's healthy and one's indulgent and we're gonna see how they compare all right so we are gonna start off with the guilty pleasure i'm gonna do the classic regular peanut butter cookies i'm gonna start by mixing my dry ingredients here i'm using some all-purpose flour i'm just gonna add it to a bowl and then i'm gonna be using both baking powder and baking soda just because the peanut butter tends to make the cookies a little dense so we just kind of want to lighten things up and if you guys want the full recipe it'll be listed out in the description box below then i'm going to add a little bit of salt to balance the sweetness and we'll just give it a mix mix mix all right we are done with the dry ingredients so now i'm going to work on the wet ingredients all right so for the wet ingredients i'm going to start by creaming the butter and sugars first i just have a stick of butter here that's room temperature to make it really easy to work with add it into the bowl and then i'm using a combination of white granulated sugar and brown sugar this way the cookie will have that crispiness on the outside and soft chewiness on the inside just go ahead and cream it with a hand blender for about two minutes until it's nice and fluffy [Music] all right this looks great let's go ahead and scrape the bowl down with our spatula now i'll add my egg some vanilla extract and our peanut butter so for the peanut butter i'm using a natural one a natural creamy one like this and you'll notice that this one kind of separated but that's totally fine i usually try to look for ones with just salt and peanuts so this one from costco is actually one of my favorites this one or the trader joe's one and i'm just gonna use a cup of it and we'll give it one more mix [Music] now i'll just dump in the flour mixture and just add the whole thing in at once we'll give it a final mix at low speed and that is our cookie batter just go ahead and scrape the dough back together it'll look kind of crumbly right here but once you scoop it out onto the baking pan it'll stick together and become a nice cohesive cookie dough all right so i'm just going to be using a cookie scoop to just scoop the dough out make sure it's nice and packed in and i'll just scoop it onto a baking sheet that i've already lined with parchment paper and just like your typical peanut butter cookie i'm going to take my fork flatten it and do that cross hatch action [Music] all right now let's work on our healthy cookies this peanut butter cookie recipe only uses five ingredients yes that's right five ingredients so i only need one bowl for this cookie first i'm gonna add our peanut butter i have a cup of the same creamy peanut butter here and then to sweeten it up i'm gonna use maple syrup i'm kind of cheating here because this maple syrup is already infused with cinnamon and vanilla so i'm not gonna add any extra vanilla or cinnamon to it but if you wanted to you can always add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to your maple syrup so i'm going to add half a cup a little bit of salt give it a good mix almond flour and baking powder to lighten it up a smidge and just mix everything together so just in comparison to our other dough this one is a lot smoother looking and i feel like it's gonna ball up a lot easier too okay let's go ahead and put it on our cookie sheet and in case you guys were wondering will this work with regular flour yes it would but in keeping with the healthy theme i decided to use almond flour same thing we'll flatten it and give it that cross hatch action now we're going to bake them both off at the same time to see how much they differ this is the tale of two cookies one made with five ingredients and the other with ten one's healthy and the other one not so much both are delicious but can you really tell which is which but look how similar they look despite the difference of ingredients used so i will have to say that the healthier one qualifies as healthy because number one we're using fewer ingredients so there's less calories but number two there's less refined sugar in there and um there's healthier fats with the almond flour and the peanut butter so it'll keep you satiated much longer than the straight up indulgent treat so let's go ahead and give them a taste test [Music] that is good there's a nice crispiness on the outside and the inside is just light and peanut buttery it's sweet but not too sweet and it's just a really good peanut butter cookie got my milk our palette cleanser let's try this one definitely a little more sticky than this one and i'm sure you guys have guessed by now which one's which but this one is a lot more creamy you get that more pronounced peanut butter texture overall it's very balanced it's not too sweet you get a little bit of the texture from the almond flour and it's just really good you don't get that same crispiness on the outside and softness in the inside because all around it's pretty soft but on the exterior i wouldn't say it's crispy but it's still really good in terms of weight this one feels a lot more dense than this one we did use two types of leavening agent in this versus this one and the only reason why we used two is because there was so much ingredients like the eggs the flour it could be really dense but this one only needed a little bit and because there's no acid in this one the baking soda would not react if you guys are looking for a way to curb that sweet tooth just as i am definitely give this peanut butter cookie version a try it definitely helps with mine it satisfies and it keeps me full and this one is just straight up good let me know if

cookies ever so good so addictive and made with simple and affordable ingredients what's the difference between these cookies and regular peanut butter cookies well they're made without eggs butter white sugar and the total sugar has been cut in half these healthy peanut butter cookies are so easy to make actually they're made in one bowl which is my favorite part of this recipe the batter comes together in just couple of minutes so i start by creaming together the wet ingredients first and this is the star of the show creamy or chunky cheap and rich in flavor peanut butter i prefer using natural one ingredient peanut butter without any other ingredients like sugar salt or palm oil so in a large bowl add your peanut butter it's important to keep it at room temperature before making the cookies instead of either white or brown sugar you can use honey or agave which will make the cookie sweet enough and also help the dough bind together the secret ingredient in this recipe is applesauce it is great for any type of baking and it makes these cookies extra soft and if you wonder no you can't taste the apple sauce at all usually i do this with my hand but to improve the cookie texture beat together with a mixer until really smooth let's say for a minute then add a half of the oat flour followed by corn starch to give the crisp edge and some baking powder which will make the cookies spread a bit mix it up well and add the rest of the oats oats are great for fiber and they're so filling i always have some homemade oat flour in my pantry it will come together easily and the dough should be thick like classic cookie dough if you find it is too sticky to work with just put in the freezer for 5 minutes then start to shape the cookies or you can leave it in the fridge for up to 3 days and bake later you can use a cookie scoop you're measuring tablespoon or just weigh 35 to 40 grams of dough and start rolling into a bowl you just want to make sure your cookies are the same size flatten a bit and place on a lined baking sheet you'll have about 12 cookies in total of course you want your peanut butter cookies with that classic criss-cross mark on top so use a fork and gently press down each cookie this will help your cookies bake evenly too if it sticks to the dough just dip your fork into the water and then onto the cookie these cookies don't spread much so if you prefer softer cookies more shape them thicker and don't bake your cookies longer than 10 minutes when pulled out of the oven your cookies will be slightly undercooked quite tender and soft but they'll firm up as they cool while continue to cook in the inside anyway let them rest on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before moving then you can transfer to a wire rack and give them a little bit more time to get a nice crispy edge these healthy peanut butter cookies are soft chewy and loaded with peanut butter flavor and they're just as delicious as traditional ones the best way to enjoy these cookies is of course with a glass of your favorite milk but their perfect grab-and-go snack for busy days see anyone can bake these easy peanut butter cookies so go and do some baking now and trust me after one bite you'll be hooked if you're not a peanut butter person i'm sure you love nutella so you can make these super easy healthy nutella cookies they're made with homemade nutella and two simple ingredients really delicious check out that recipe now thank you so much for watching see you in another video stay healthy stay happy", "NqEVxYb8imo": "[Music] that's pretty good welcome to wheats guys the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today's review is a good old-fashioned classic because we were taking a look at edibles and a classic edible kind at that the cookie we're finally digging into big Pete's here I've heard actually a lot of really good thing about big Pete's so I am excited to give it a try but that's a lot of calories in here haha just look at the nutrition information [ __ ] um so this is the mini cookie model which seems to be the biggest model out there for edibles in California I'm gonna say pioneered by Korova I don't know if that's actually true um that's where I first saw the the first time used some to use that model was kirova so 10 cookies 10 milligrams of THC each because that is what the regulations are you can only have ten milligrams max per individual serving and then you can only have ten servings for a total of 100 milligrams for any legal edibles so this is a big heavy ass hunk in bag of cookies there's 700 calories in total we've got a really wonderful packaging here great information lab testing results right there on the back nutrition information ingredients dosing instructions everything we even have a little story there on the back which I won't bore you with I'm just gonna take a peek right right out of here now uh okay good for you big Pete not that interesting so uh if you've never tuned into ones before unfortunately I'm gonna eat this whole friggin bag of cookies um because that's the way we're our room edibles reviews work is I eat the whole product to review the whole product and let you know how I feel about it two hours after I finished the last one of these cookies really don't have to eat 100 calories worth of cookies right now but I do it for you guys so uh I actually figured out how to open the childproof baggy on this one goomy I'm learning smells in there ooh they smell really good actually they smell like really really good peanut butter cookies there is a little bit of cannabis odor but they smell great here we are we've got the little lattice work on the top for the peanut butter cookie it looks good god damn this is great there's maybe a little bit of canvas taste but this is a good peanut butter cookie it's a lot softer I mean it's not soft but it is a lot softer than the the other mini cookies there's ones have the more Chips Ahoy brittle II thing and this is a little brittle but it's suddenly a little chewier than the others and it's great it's got a great peanut butter flavor just the right amount of crunch whoops mmm well if I have to eat ten of these at least they taste pretty good right okay chewie on the taste front guys I can tell you these are great genuinely surprised I mean I've heard good things about him but that [ __ ] was unexpected how good that was um so big thumbs up there but really guys what we all want to know is anybody can go get a mazing bag of cookies for the 20 bucks with these costs you want to make sure that these [ __ ] expensive ass cookies are gonna get you really high and for that guys you look to stick around for just a second and I will be back to you guys Oh in about two hours or so after

man this is a huge thumbs up I could not be more happy with this the only problem is I have not yet thought of a cherry on top so I have to sit here and think of one for a second cuz I can't leave you

like that I think have good taste like you guys cuz I think you guys all have great excellent wonderful taste is the most successful book I've ever recommended to people in terms of like batting average of them loving it I met a hundred percent right now or a thousand batting a thousand try not to mix metaphors holy [ __ ] that's a lot of build-up for the book which is then we came to the end by Jonah no not Jonah Joshua Faris Joshua Faris I think that's his name if we're not I'm going to be embarrassed great novel it's a weird novel that's told in the first person plural meaning they say like we and us instead of I and him or her and it is about the dot-com collapse an office that's like an advertising firm for dot-com companies right at the end of the dot-com collapse it is hysterical is so funny it is very poignant and it is sort of has come around to being sort of relevant again today with the shape of the tech industry so again that was then we came to the end that

kitchen today we're going to be making old-fashioned peanut butter cookies now these are those peanut butter cookies like the grandma used to make there's a really thick rich chewy soft old-fashioned peanut butter cookies and they have pretty basic ingredients you want a stick of butter which is 1/2 a cup of butter 1 egg have a teaspoon of vanilla and you can leave that out or put it in but I really like the way the vanilla accents the other flavors in just about anything I make but especially in cookies now I'm using a cup and a half of all-purpose flour if you are using self-rising you're not gonna need this stuff over here you might want to put just a tiny little bit of baking powder in it if you want them really thick but I also have a 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder just a little bit of salt less than 1/4 teaspoon and I've got about 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to sweeten these I have half a cup of regular sugar and a half cup of brown sugar and I've got 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter now you can use self-rising flour if that's all you've got but the all-purpose you're going to want to add some leavening to it and I'm gonna go ahead and dump in the baking powder and the salt and the baking soda into my flour and kind of whisk that up a little bit you can also sift this if you want to and your grandma was right any time you sift your flour it makes your baked products a little lighter I usually do it the lazy way and just use a fork or a whisk or something and put a little air into it but what we want to start with is our butter and we're going to put our butter in our mixer and we're gonna beat that butter until it's really whipped and that's gonna make our cookies much lighter you can mix them by hand or use a hand mixer but like I said you really want to make this butter good and when you do that you're gonna see exactly what we got here it's gonna stick all to the sides of the bowl so I'm gonna scrape my bowl and do this one more time with just the butter and then we're going to add my sugar to the bowl and really cream the butter and the sugar together they don't get it creamed even better but you do want to start even though it mostly sticks to the side of the bowl with the butter [Music] if we were using a hand mixer you might be able to get it a little bit better if you had did a double batch so that you had more butter it would definitely whip up a little bit better but because I only have that half a cup in there it's not whipping real well on its own it mostly sticks to the sides of my mixer and this is a half a cup of packed brown sugar brown sugar in cookies it makes the cookies softer and chewy and you can cut your white sugar and add more brown sugar if you want you can even do all brown sugar and have a really chewy cookie I'm gonna scrape my bowl again because a lot of my butter is still sticking in the bottom of the bowl and I really want to cream that good because that's the difference in an okay peanut butter cookie and a really good peanut butter cookie okay I got pretty good now I'm gonna go ahead and add my peanut butter and I'm gonna cream the peanut butter and with the sugar and the butter I'm gonna scrape the bowl one more time and cream it again just a little bit and you can make these with crunchy peanut butter or creamy peanut butter it's just when whichever one you prefer if you don't want the nuts and cookies use creamy or if you want a little chunk in your cookie go ahead and use crunchy peanut butter okay I'm gonna hit this one more time all right now I'm gonna add my vanilla and my egg and I'm gonna kind of scrape the sides the bowl down so that all that gets mixed in together okay now we get to add our flour mixture now when you're baking at home brands do kind of matter because there are some brands of flour that are much better than others I usually get unbleached flour whenever I'm baking anything because unbleached is just much healthier for you but I like Pillsbury I like King Arthur and I like white lily I have used other brands that are they're not ground soft enough to really be good in baking some of them are so coarse that your cookies just won't come out so it does kind of matter what brand you choose when you're baking at home those three brands I know are good I've never had a problem with them ever being too coarse or my baked goods not coming out I'm gonna add this all at once and I'm gonna use my spatula and scrape the sides and just kind of fold this in so that and I'm gonna hit it with my mixer at the end it makes it good but if you just put your mixer down in there and you hit that flour it's gonna blow it all over the kitchen and that's never good also some of the brands of peanut butter can be a little bit greedy some of the off friends so you might want to be careful with those if you have a store brand or something that you really like though it should be fine but this ones that are super vents and a little greedy they're not good in this recipe and our dough is pretty well mixed up and this dough is not gonna be super sticky it's gonna be pretty easy to handle when you get it out of here now at this point you can take your spatula and you can clean this out and you can put this all wrap it up in some saran wrap or wax paper and put it in the refrigerator because you do want to refrigerate it or you can go ahead and take your cookie scooper while it's cool or if you don't have a cookie scooper and just use spoons and go ahead and form it into cookies before you put it in the refrigerator because right now it's soft and it's gonna be easy to handle with a cookie scooper once you put it in the refrigerator and it firms up you're really gonna have to use some force to get it out of there and I know a lot of people have commented that they have trouble with arthritis and I did too so I understand that so if you use your cookie scooper now it will be much easier on your hand and you just scoop the cookies out and you can keep these if you wrap this up good and tight put it down in a ziplock bag or even just in the wax paper wrap it up real tight you can keep these in the fridge for a couple of weeks and just take them out as you want them and bake them so that you have fresh baked cookies for a couple of weeks without the mess you know like that refrigerator cookie dough that you buy and this recipe will make about two dozen cookies of course it kinda depends on the size and making them you want to put this in the fridge for at least an hour 2 or 3 hours is even better so that it gets good and stiff and it doesn't flatten out a lot when you bake it also that time in the fridge kind of Lentz the dough rest and it it just Rises there and the texture the cooking is better if you let your cookie dough rest before you bake it if you've ever used a cookie scooper to scoop out cold though you know how difficult that is and it can be really hard to squeeze the scooper this is much much easier so whether you can have arthritis or not I really recommend warming the cookies before you cut your dough in the refrigerator okay this made like 28 cookies so I got a couple extra ones out of this branch okay so now like I said you want to wrap this up and you want to put it in the refrigerator for at least an hour you can do it overnight or you can leave it up to a couple weeks when you take your cookies out of the refrigerator they're gonna look like this they're just gonna be little balls and they're gonna be very firm much firmer than when they went in the refrigerator that's why I said it's a good idea to go ahead and scoop them before you put them in there and you're just gonna space these out on the pan they're not gonna spread out a whole lot when they bake so you don't need like a ton of room between them but you didn't want to space them out a little bit you can get about a dozen on a cookie sheet together and once you get them on your cookie sheet you're gonna use a fork to make that crisscross pattern that we all remember and grandma's peanut butter cookies you want to mash the cookies down some but you don't want to mash them flat and when you do this you don't want to just mash and then pick your fork up you want to mash down and then slide your fork and you do want to kind of hold the edges to keep it from breaking apart like that I just did but if you just mash down and then pick your fork up what's gonna happen is all the top of the cookies gonna come off on the fork like that if you have trouble with your fork sticking in this which you shouldn't if you refrigerate them because the dough wasn't super sticky even before I put it in the refrigerator and as long as you slide it it'll come out this time but if you have trouble with that you can dip your fork in just a little bit of granulated white sugar and that will help keep it from sticking if you want a little bit of a variation on your cookies you can also roll your cookies before you do the cross pattern in them and a little bit of granulated sugar and it'll give you a little bit of a texture on the outside of the cookie the size in the shape of your cookies is not gonna change a whole lot once you put them in the oven so how thick you want them is gonna be determined but right now when you mash them out they're gonna come out about this thick they will be a little bit bigger around but not a whole lot if you want a thinner cookie you're gonna want to mash them out more before you put them in the oven and you're gonna bake these in anywhere between a 300 and a 350 degree oven a cooler temperature when you're baking them will give you a slightly chewy cookie I usually do mine in a 350 degree oven for about 10 to 12 minutes how thick they are is gonna determine partly how long they bake also the type of oven so yours could bake as little as 8 minutes especially if you have a convection oven or if you make them thinner it's not going to take as long to bake them but if you want them really really chewy turn the oven down to 350 's in the evidence okay our cookies are done now and then you spread out a little bit but like I said not much and they are still as thick as they were when I'm - the mountain with the fork now you don't want to take them off your cookie sheet immediately because if you do that'll cause them to fall you remember when you were a kid you went running through the kitchen and you ran out if there was cake in the oven because I said the jar would make it fall well the same thing is true with cookies when you take your top cookies out of the oven you want to sit them down carefully on the counter or not slam them and let them sit there for a couple of minutes before you take them off and move to a rack or something to cool and if you line your pan with parchment paper you can really let them cool on the pan and they'll be fine you don't have to move them off to a rack but if you do move them off to a rack like I said you want to give them a couple of minutes to sit there if you move them right away they'll fall and they'll get really flat so if you've had that problem with any homemade cookie chocolate chip or oatmeal or whatever you need to let them sit for just a minute or two before you move them off the pan you can see they're just a little bit brown on the bottom and there you can see they're about as thickest when I mashed them out with a fork and they spread out just a little bit but these will be soft and tender and they will bring back so many memories of grandma's kitchen and just the smell of them in here it kind of brings back childhood memories these are the traditional version I know there are a lot of more modern versions out there but these are the ones that you had when you were a kid this is a pretty simple recipe there are a few tricks to get them to come out right but I hope you give these a try and remember some of those times when you were a kid and you went by grandma's house and she had these cookies coming out of the end and hot and fresh thank you so much for joining this and then you'll really kitchen if you haven't already please click like and subscribe before you leave and until next time remember to put God first [Music]", "Mk0RplLSpZs": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make peanut butter cookies and this is what they look like peanut butter cookies are instantly recognizable because I have that really nice crisscross pattern and the flavor of course is peanut butter and the texture is firm on the outside yet the Centers of the peanut butter cookie are nice and soft and chewy so to make your batter if you have a stand mixer like I have here use your paddle attachment you could use a hand mixer or really for this batter you could just have a large bowl with the wooden spoon the first thing you will need is three-quarters of a cup of which is 170 grams of butter and have your butter at room temperature now you can use unsalted which is my preference what I like the flavor and I also like to control the salt in my recipe but if you have a favorite salted butter by all means you could use that let's put that in there and then I'm just going to beat this you know medium low speed until it's nice and smooth okay it's bad a scrape and next I'm going to add a half a cup a hundred grams of granulated white sugar along with 1/2 a cup 100 grams of light brown sugar if you're not weighing your brown sugar when you put it into the measuring cup kind of patted down have it nice and firmly packed and then I'm also adding one teaspoon four grams of pure vanilla extract so now I'm just going to beat this on medium speed until everything gets mixed together [Music] [Applause] okay so that's mixed together next of course we need peanut butter you will need three quarters of a cup which is 185 grams of your favorite peanut butter so you can use the smooth my favorite or you can use the crunchy which means it has some peanuts pieces of peanuts in it either one I'm not continuing which one you like and you can use either you know some peanut butters the one I'm using it has a stabilizer in it you could use the natural peanut butter whatever you want the difference is like a natural you will notice it tends to separate and the oil will get on the top and you usually have to stir it if you have a stabilizer you don't have that problem but either one yeah I'm just gonna beat that in [Music] okay so that's all mixed together so next we're going to add one large egg it's 50 grams have your egg at room temperature and I'm just going to beat that in [Music] [Applause] okay easy enough so now for our dry ingredients in a separate bowl I have two cups which is 260 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that as plain flour to that I'm going to add a half a teaspoon two grams of baking soda in there and just a quarter of a teaspoon one gram of salt now if you used salted butter then I would just leave out this salt and I'm just gonna whisk that I'm using a whisk you could just use a fork spoon just want to make sure that that baking soda is really mixed into the flour because if you get like little pockets like a little chunk or no not chunk but like a pocket of baking soda it might taste a little bitter so that's why you want to make sure that you really whisk that baking soda into the flour so I'm going to add all that in now at this point I just like I like smooth peanut butter and I don't like any chocolate chips or extra peanuts at it but if you do at this point you could add like a half a cup of chopped peanuts or a half a cup of chocolate chips if you like that that would be about 85 grams of either one of those but I'm gonna just have nice smooth peanut butter cookie today [Music] okay if you noticed I always have my mixer on really low speed when I add the flour because you don't want that flour coming up in your face so that's our batter I mean you could do this by hand it's really not it's not like you have to whip it or anything so it's easy enough so now my batter you know is a little soft my kitchens warm and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover my batter and put it into the refrigerator you know maybe a half an hour to an hour because we have to roll it into ball round balls and so it's a little soft so maybe you know 30 60 minutes and then when you are when it's firm then you want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius so when that happens when my batters firm we'll be back and we'll bake off our cookies so my batter is firm so we are ready to make our cookies you will need a baking sheet now I've lined mine with parchment paper but you could just lightly butter it or spray it with one of those nonstick sprays now as you can see here this is the size cookie I like that's about three inch in diameter seven and a half centimeters so for that size cookie you will need to roll the batter into 2 inch round balls which would be if you have a scale it's perfect for this you will need 35 grams of batter I also like to use a scale because that way I can make sure that every cookie is exactly the same size which is what you want because you want them to all bake in the same amount of time so it's important to get them all the same size so take your batter roll it in to around and these are fairly big cookies so I'm putting 8 on a baking sheet now this batter if you didn't want to bake all your cookies off at once you could cover it and like leave it in the fridge a couple days or another idea is you could like make all of your cookies like form them like this put them on a baking sheet take the whole baking sheet put it into the to the freezer and then let these freeze and then just take them off of the baking sheet and then you could Pat you know put them in a plastic freezer bag or some kind of plastic container and you freeze them then bake your cookies on demand which is a nice thing for the busy mom so now once I doing rounds what I do is I flatten them first just with my finger now some people if you want a rustic looking cook you can just take your fork and then just make your crisscross pattern I like mine well okay I like mine nice and round kind of perfect or try to make them perfect so I put a little sugar on there and then I have a glass that's about that's about two and a quarter inch diameter which is about six centimeters and that's what I'm gonna flatten my cookie into a boat that size round like so and then the way then I just put a little sugar on there peanut butter cookies are sweet and it kind of salty they're really good and then take your fork and of course we got to have that classic I don't know who came up with that the crisscross pattern but now it seems like if you make peanut butter cookies you gotta do it that way so okay to bake these everyone's oven is a little different and plus it depends on the texture that you like your peanut butter cookies for me I like the outside they're gonna just be firm and just barely tinged with brown but the center's will still look quite soft if you touch them that's how I like it outside firm and the center soft and chewy so for that I'm gonna say in my oven somewhere I find ten eleven minutes for mine so I'm going to say ten to 13 because you know everybody's having this a little different if you like them like kind of crisp of course you're gonna go to the higher end of the baking time if you a lot of times when the first time I'm baking cookies I just bake a couple because you know they're so small and they bake so quickly and I'm trying to figure out what the texture is that I like so I bake off a couple like to practice and see if I like that so that's if you're new to baking you might want to try that and I do want like to rotate my baking sheet front to back about halfway through baking so I'm going to say 10 to 13 minutes okay so our peanut butter cookies are done put your baking sheet on a wire rack so you can see the outside if I touch their firm just barely starting to brown and the center's are still nice and soft so I'm going to let these cool you know a few minutes because they're very soft and they're fragile and then I'm going to use my spatula to transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling and then when we come back we will try one okay so let's try one huh still the center's are still soft whenever you make a cookie texture I mean sight the flavor of course is very important but the texture of the cookie is very important you know how do you like a deal like it really like some people like it really crisp some people like you know almost under baked so and the good thing is you can just adjust your baking time to get the way you personally want it now for me this is perfect the outside is nice a little crisp and yet the center is soft and a little chewy and you know really good peanut butter flavor not like overpowering but a really nice peanut butter flavor like I said I use the smooth because that's what I like and I don't I don't usually add the chocolate chips or even chopped peanuts but if you like a nice crunch then use the crunchy peanut butter and then add some additional peanuts for them you know a really nice cookie you can store them for quite a few days you could freeze them you know once you bake them off you can also freeze them then but you must try it and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski enjoy baking Calm [Music] you [Music]", "6l3F6htYgPg": "- If

Add a quarter of a cup of granulated sugar and two thirds of a cup\nof packed brown sugar. Add a half of a cup of\ncreamy peanut butter, and then stir or use a mixer\nto mix them until smooth. Now, because the butter is melted. I don't even need to use my hand mixer. You can, you can do it\neither way you want, but stir that together\nuntil it's nice and creamy. Mix in one teaspoon of vanilla\nextract, one large egg, a half of a teaspoon of baking soda and a half of a teaspoon of salt until it's nice and smooth. And then mix in one and a quarter\ncups of all-purpose flour. At this point, you have a nice cookie dough and we're going to add\nour chocolate chips. So you're going to stir in one and a half cups of chocolate chips. You can use any you want,\nsemi-sweet, milk, combination. However you want. Just use one and a half\ncups of chocolate chips. Use a cookie scoop to scoop two tablespoon\nsize cookie dough balls and put them onto a cookie sheet that has a parchment paper or\na Silpat baking that on it. [Low Music] and then we're going to make them look like peanut butter cookies by making those crisscross\nmarks with the fork. [Low Music] Then bake your cookies for\nabout eight to 12 minutes until they just lose their glossy sheen and then it's time to enjoy them. Once you have them nice and\nbaked, you can eat them, you can share them, you can freeze them. I know you're going to\nlove them as much as we do, with chocolate and peanut butter, my favorite flavors, and\ntons of great reviews on my website. These are a fantastic cookie recipe. Be sure to keep watching\nfor even more cookies.", "qXZqly9GGho": "Today on Sugar Spun Run I'll be showing you how to make flourless peanut butter cookies. Hey Sugar Spun Bakers! It's\nSam here and today I have a recipe for you that's a little bit different from\nthe recipes I typically share. This peanut butter cookie recipe is super\nsoft and chewy. Super flavorful. I'm sure you're going to love it, but it uses no\nflour. It uses no butter. It uses only a handful of basic pantry staple\ningredients. There's no mixer required, super simple. Now to get started you'll\nwant to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and you are going to\nneed a medium or large size bowl. Now you're going to need 1 cup of sugar for\nthis recipe. You can use just 1 cup of granulated sugar, but I like to use a\nblend, 1/2 granulated sugar and half light brown sugar for your brown sugar you want to make sure you firmly pack this into your measuring cup. I also like to add a pinch of salt this is just 1/4 teaspoon of salt. And my personal\npreference is to use 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in these cookies. It's going\nto make them spread nicely, give them some nice little crackles on top, but if you\ndo not have baking soda you can leave it out. Your cookies are still going to\ntaste good. Now we'll just use a whisk or spoon to stir these ingredients together\nbecause you want to get that baking soda and that's salt nicely incorporated in\nwith the sugars. I think you guys know that I am a butter and flour using fiend. So if I love this recipe that doesn't use either of those ingredients I'm\npretty sure you're going to love it too. So now we can add our remaining\ningredients. You are going to need 1 cup of creamy peanut butter, though I think crunchy peanut butter would probably work just fine as well. I don't want to waste any of this. We'll add 1 large egg And I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla\nextract for a little depth of flavor. If you do not have vanilla extract you can\nleave it out. And we'll just stir everything together until it is well\ncombined. You guys don't really even need a video for this recipe but I've committed to making videos for all of my recipes so I guess you're getting one\nanyway. If you want to use an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer for this recipe you absolutely can. I just usually opt not to because it's so easy just to\nmake it in one single bowl. So this recipe is based off of\none that's been circulating the internet for a long time. You might have heard of\nthe three ingredient peanut butter cookie recipe. It just uses granulated\nsugar, and egg, and peanut butter. Of course I like to complicate things a\nlittle bit but I promise you I think these extra ingredients are 100% worth it. Alright so once you have everything mixed up you're going to want to grab a baking sheet. I like to line mine with parchment paper. It makes cleanup a lot\neasier, but if you don't have parchment paper you can just scoop your cookie\ndough directly onto an ungreased cookie sheet. I'll be using my 1 and 1/2\ntablespoon size cookie scoop. I'm just going to portion level scoops of this\ndough onto my baking sheet. So you're going to flatten these cookies just a\nlittle bit before you pop them in the oven, because the dough is so sticky. I\nlike to just sprinkle the tops with a little bit of granulated sugar just so\nmy fingers don't stick to the dough. You could use the tines of a fork to do this,\nlike with classic peanut butter cookies, and please note that if you did not use\nbaking soda you're going to have to flatten the cookies a little bit more\njust because they are a little more resistant to spreading without the\nbaking soda. Now these come together so quickly you want to make sure your oven is completely preheated before you transfer them into your oven. My oven is\nat 350 degrees Fahrenheit so now I'm going to bake these for about 10 to 12\nminutes. Make sure you do not over bake these cookies or they will be too dry\nwhen you pull your cookies out of the oven. They should be just barely\nbeginning to turn golden brown around the edges. As you can see these are just barely slightly darker on the edges. They should\nstill seem a little bit under baked in the center, and you're going to want to\nlet them cool completely on the baking sheet because they're going to be pretty\nfragile while they're still warm. And that is how easy it is to make these\nflourless, butterless, peanut butter cookies at home. Now if you have the time\nI generally recommend you stick with my classic peanut butter cookie, but in a\npinch these are amazing. They're addictive and I really think you're\ngoing to love them. They're definitely worth the time it takes to make it.\nAlright if you guys try this one out please let me know what you think. I\nalways love hearing from you. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you\nnext time. So good.", "0mh5BRl-cvA": "hey everybody welcome back to my bake like a pro YouTube channel let's have some fun today and let's make some really nice peanut butter cookies for today's video we're gonna need two and a half cups of all-purpose flour this is equal to 375 grams all purpose flour is also known as plain flour it's exactly the same type of flour 1 cup of granulated white sugar this is 200 grams 1 cup of brown sugar this is 230 grams one cup of salted butter 227 grams one cup of peanut butter this is 250 grams 2 teaspoons of baking powder this is 10 grams and our last ingredient 2 large eggs so those are the ingredients let's get started for a first step I'll get in all of our white granulated sugar and then all of our butter and my butter is salted if you're using unsalted butter you can add a little bit of salt to your recipe and then all of our brown sugar and whenever you measure brown sugar make sure that you pack it into your little measuring cup so that you get an accurate reading and then all of our peanut butter this is going to be good okay that's good get my beater on this by the way is the brand new Cuisinart stand mixer and if you want to know more about this I do have an unboxing of this whole machine brand new machine and also I have some videos where I use it I'm gonna drop this down speed number one and just start mixing all this together but if you don't have a stand mixer you can use a hand electric mixer as well just get it up to speed number three if I'll get everything off the beaters and start mixing this well so I'm just gonna let this go for about a minute or so I really want to start getting this all fully incorporated I'm just gonna turn this up a little bit have speed number eight that's good lift this up I'll get my first egg in just get that going and while that's going I'll break my second egg I have a lot of people asking me why do you break your eggs into a separate container why don't you put them right into the mixture well if you break an egg directly into your mixture it's a lot harder finding that little piece of shell instead of finding it in here if you find it in here you can easily pull it out it's a lot harder when it's in your bowl so that's good we'll get that second egg in and then we'll mix this super easy recipe so I'm gonna turn my mixer up and I just want to get all of this really well creamed okay that's good we have our flour here and our baking powder I'll just get that all together picking this up and then just mix this around a little bit does not have to be perfect you can sift the sim or just get it in like this what I'm gonna do about half closed the machine speed number one and just let that mix until you know it's almost mixed together and then we'll put in the rest of our flour okay that's good and then the rest of our flower and that's it for the ingredients close it up and now mix this now if you are using a hand mixer after you started incorporating the flour as soon as it starts getting a little bit too much for your mixer to handle just finish it off with a big wooden spoon and you'll be fine I'm just going to turn this to speed number two that looks good just like that bring that help clean off your beater and we are ready for the next step so at this point our dough is very very soft you can see how soft this is it would be a little bit hard to work with so I'm gonna pop this into the fridge for about 1 hour and then we'll finish off the recipe so here we are again this is one hour later I'll just go in I'll just show you you can see that this is a lot more stiff now so we are ready to go so got myself a scoop you can go with a smaller scoop than this I'm gonna make my cookies a little bit larger so I'm just gonna get a little bit you take your scoop and then you push it up against the side and that will help you get a uniform cookie so there we go and then just get it right on there and I do have my oven preheated right now to 350 degrees Fahrenheit mmm this dough smells amazing get it up there a little bit of a squeeze you can bake them like this or you can push them down and do the traditional little fork which I'm gonna do I have a little bit of sugar in here I'm just gonna get my fork into the sugar and then just give it a little bit of a push sugar push and then go the other way try to keep it circular so push down the sugar gives a nice little sweetness to the top finishes it off and it also helps you remove the fork from the dough if you don't do that you'll find sometimes that your fork sticks so just give a little bit of a push you get that nice little pattern on there let's push down so my oven is going 350 degrees Fahrenheit you always want to put cookies or cakes or pizzas into a hot oven you never want to take this and put this into an oven that is cold so there we go that's good that when there needs a little bit more of a push out how does that look pretty good perfect so I've got these to bake off I've got all of these I want to keep this video short so I'm gonna bake everything off and then I'll come back and I'm gonna let you know exactly how long I bake the cookies and then we'll break into one and we'll finish off the video so that's it off to the oven and I'll see you in a while so here we are again these just came out of the oven about five minutes ago you can see these ones are coming off nicely even though they're so large they come off very easily just get right under there look at that and I baked these exactly fourteen minutes in my 350 degree fahrenheit oven get that off to the side so these ones here are still cooling and then I'll bring in the other ones here and I better count them all so that we all know exactly how many this recipe made these here you have to try this recipe if you love peanut butter and love cookies you have to try this so let's give a really fast count so we've got 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 cookies so these are

well so that's it for today and I'll see you next time going in for a little bite mmm amazing YUM love those cookies those are really really good you", "jYg12hNK8dU": "and good afternoon everybody today I'm going to show you how to make craft peanut butter cookies and if you wondering why I'm laughing I made these a while back and my buddy said like why don't you shoot a video and I'm like the recipes on the side of the jar oh oh right and single yeah but what about the craft dinner and I thought about that and for those that don't know I have a craft and a recipe there was a co-worker many many years ago who just it never came out right so I said I would do a video on how to make it that it came out right and 150,000 views later well here we are so I figured maybe it's not his dumbest idea as I thought because even though you see a recipe somewhere there's a difference between translating printed stuff into actually making it and if this helps you make that connection and start cooking more well it's good just for that when they said super easy they were not kidding okay the recipe I got it memorized is one cup of peanut butter half a cup of sugar one egg mixed it up bake at 325 for 20 minutes at set yeah one change I do make with this is I don't use two cookie sheets I just jam them in closer you can do whatever you want and if you've never measured peanut butter and a spatula is quite good for this plus you're gonna need a spatula to mix them and when I was a little kid and I'd read these recipes I always thought you know it doesn't come out unless you use the brand on the recipe well surprise yeah does as long as you use creamy you're fine okay they may taste slightly different cuz the peanut butter is different but Passa I wouldn't worry you know okay so we've got our peanut butter and just get that in your ball good enough sugar and the egg I probably should be putting this in a bowl and just for you who've never baked before the reason to do that is to make sure the egg is good and second of all if you drum and the eggshell pieces you can pick them out of the little bowl and I'm gonna get in there okay now start stirring and you will actually see something while we do this you'll see that at the beginning it's quite runny and at some point a chemical reaction takes place in here and all of a sudden the entire mass will just seize up on you which can be quite surprising if you've never made this before so you look at that not quite there but you will start to feel it really hard to stir this is normal now you can keep stirring until it's totally seized up or you can just let it sit on its own even my arms starting to get a bit tired with this yeah see it's gonna just stand up straight like that it tells you to roll into 24 balls but it doesn't tell you how now if you some people will do a drop cookie thing it's in disaster with this I got off my trusty kitchen gloves and got on the other side of the counter for this now this is gonna be quite soft and forgiving which is good so got balls about that big just roll it up and drop it onto your cookie sheet I'll use nonstick so I don't have to worry and don't be concerned if they're all exactly the same size because you yes you can borrow from one cookie to the other at the end which is what I always do it's just faster to roll them this way and if you don't get to 24 while they cook just as well many I have made many batches of 22 cookies let me tell you now you do want to keep your spouse or around right till the end don't throw it in the sink because you want to get all those bits off the bottom and here we have 23 cookies so this is where I'm going to show you how you borrow from these now you don't want to borrow from too many because then you have to reroll all of them so look for the once and just pinch some off and jam it together you get the idea and the ones that have been pinched off well you can see pretty quick where they are so that's not to worry and then look we have a new cookie okay so I'm just going to take a minute and we roll the borrowed ones back into shape these can sit here for a bit if you forgot to heat up your oven and but that's a general really good thing to get in the habit when you're doing any kind of baking is just eat the oven first before you do anything else she's gonna get a nice big fork and you're gonna do them all one way then you're gonna go back and crosshatch them like that all the cookies are crosshatch ready for the oven for 20 minutes at 325 timer went off let's haul these up oh yeah they're really soft nice hope you put them in one it's gonna show like that one I do that on purpose to help you know I'm kidding yeah so they're really soft so yeah they're really soft coming out of the oven and it's really easy to put a thumb in one of them I guess I got that one later now you can see you didn't actually need two sheets yeah they stick together a little bit and I got another surprise for you you don't actually need a cooling rack either what you do need to do is just let this sit there for a couple of minutes until they harden up a bit because if not they're all gonna go down like that there is an advantage to having a banged-up cookie because you can use that to test ah they're cool enough that they come off so what I do is I do got a spatula if you want to wait til they get really cold you can actually just use your fingers and I just get like a nice plate and as long as they're cool enough that you can get the spatula under them without them deforming they're cool enough to put on a plate so that's how you make crafts super easy peanut butter cookies and they don't get easier than this no the bunked up ones at the bottom so I'm not gonna dig for it I'll just try with you these are really good one they're still hot to them this is about one of the easiest recipes for new bakers there is so if you do want to try your hand at baking give these a shot and what we're gonna thanks for watching I'll see you again", "-4F1JRHrqJE": "today's recipe is something i'm really craving today um uh since breakfast i've i really want warm fresh cookies um and i

little frightened right now i haven't even lived here a week yet and there's already a hurricane heading right towards my house hurricane laura i think they should have called her hurricane karen you'll probably see this video in the future so if this is my last video guys you know what happened my life savings investment was the death of me when we examine our diets we look at the foods that cause us problems it'd be hard-pressed to find a list that didn't have cookies sitting right at the top much like santa claus i love me a cookie but the problem with them is they're loaded with sugar and you can't you're not just gonna eat one you're gonna eat every single one that's on the plate so in today's video we're gonna make a batch of cookies and you don't even gotta feel the tiniest bit of guilt when you down the entire back in today's video we will be making anabolic peanut butter cookies all that great peanut butter flavor and that sweetness of a regular peanut butter cookie except these ones are loaded with protein and ain't gonna make you hate yourself after you eat the whole batch gooey creamy delicious minimal ingredients and ready in under 10 minutes i'm telling you give this one a shot and i promise you're gonna love it i guarantee you as always if you have the rgf recipe book link in description it's been updated this recipe's in there along with every other one of my dessert recipes you want a mcflurry you want a blizzard you don't want to hate yourself after you eat it then this book could change your life man any little guide right in your pocket all the ingredients all the measurements all the calories all the macros high in protein you're going to be anabolic all freaking day you get it one time you get every future spf different free guys i'm telling you it's a steal so if you guys are ready to get another epic video underway then as always man i'm here to do it for you let's do it [Music] first thing we're going to do is grab a food scale and a mixing bowl if you try to do this without a food scale it's like navigating the amazon without a map you're going to get eaten by a lion the first ingredient we're going to put in our mixing bowl is 64 grams of pb fit powder i can't say it enough man if you're trying to stay anabolic but you still want nuts drop the regular peanut butter it's not worth it too many calories too much fat you get this you get all the flavor all the protein all the benefits without all the extra calories man trust me i'm a marine biologist [Music] and then in order to get this the same consistency as peanut butter we're going to toss in 85 grams of plain fat-free greek yogurt it's gonna thicken it up give it that consistency while adding even more protein and none of the fat it's a win-win my guy it's a win-win [Music] and then finally we just want to add about 35 grams of water too much it's gonna be too runny we want just enough now i'm just going to go in with a spoon and mix it all up until it reconstitutes and once you've mixed it for a couple minutes it should be thick and have a peanut butter consistency now we're just going to add 31 grams of a vanilla based whey protein powder as always i got that final boss cinnamon toast swirl in my opinion this protein is a little sweeter than your standard vanilla so i think with these recipes it adds that nice little kick that that really brings these over the top next we're going to add about 14 grams of coconut flour we get lots of fiber with this stuff guys it's going to help these expand while also keeping us full can't really argue with either one of them now we just need to add about 10 grams of a zero calorie sweetener i buy sucralose the great value big bag the knockoff don't be scared of this stuff guys there's no bad side effects well there is one thing i do feel obligated to mention i had spilled some on the floor and i just kind of threw it out in my backyard the next day all the bugs in my backyard were the size of small rodents i had to fight off a lawn beetle with a baseball bat other than that i've really noticed enough now to add some sweetness with no sugar i'm going to throw in 21 grams of sugar-free imitation honey this stuff's great guys a little bit goes a long way and it makes your cookies shiny i don't know about you guys but i was raised to like my things shiny [Music] and then last but not least we need about three grams of baking powder because we are baking and now that all of our ingredients are in the bowl we just gotta go in once again and mix everything up once you've mixed it up it should be really thick and have a cookie dough light consistency and seriously man if you taste this if you just take a little bit of this batter it legit tastes just like peanut butter cookie dough and that's how you know we have a winner now we're just gonna lay out a baking pan slap a piece of foil on her hit it with nonstick and all we're going to do is scoop out a little bit of our dough and lay it out into little piles on our pan you can make a few big ones you can make a bunch of little ones it really doesn't matter and a little heads up this dough is sticky so i like to just bring it over use my fingers and get that ball placed right on there sometimes you gotta get a little messy but that's the name of the anabolic game plus you get to lick your fingers afterwards and once you got them all laid out i like to go in with my spoon here and just flatten them out a little bit you know nothing too crazy just make them look pretty if you're gonna leave the house you might as well shave might as well put on a decent t-shirt [Music] and once our cookies are all on the baking sheet and looking pretty all we got to do is throw them in the oven at 350 degrees for about five to seven minutes why will you with a softer cookie seven a little more crunchy you can't really go wrong with either throw them in set a timer and ladies and gentlemen when we come back it's cookie time [Music] and boom after about five minutes in the oven our anabolic peanut butter cookies are finished normally these smell incredible but i'm gonna show you guys the texture of these just so you can see normally we do a cut test today we're gonna do a good old-fashioned cookie tear test take this one right down the middle oh baby get a look at that man see how it's still soft on the inside not too dry not too chewy like most protein cookies i'm telling you man that right there is how you want it creamy peanut buttery delicious just be careful if you feed these to your girlfriend she just might wake up with a beer alright guys we've been staring at it long enough i think it's time to pull up a chair strap on the old feed bag and try these things together you guys ready let's go all right guys let's get this show on the road man i'm always excited to eat cookies on camera with my favorite people since we are eating cookies i am going to keep that doctor away

peanutbutter cookie recipe has been a favorite of the Betty Crocker kitchens for decades it has not changed much since 1950 the cookies originally had shortening but now we use butter hi I'm Kristen from the Betty Crocker kitchen and I'm gonna show you how to make classic peanut butter cookies the first step is taking the time to have perfectly softened butter if the butter is too soft the cookies will turn out flat the best way to soften your butter is let it stand at room temperature for about thirty minutes when you press the butter it should leave an impression just like this place the butter in a large mixing bowl then add the granulated sugar add the brown sugar packing it firmly into the measuring cup to make cleanup a snap I've sprayed the cup with cooking spray before spooning in the peanut butter you can use any kind of peanut butter I'm using creamy but chunky will work great add the peanut butter and an egg beat this on medium speed until well mixed and creamy now I'm ready for the dry ingredients add in the flour baking soda baking powder and salt to help balance the flavor mix with a rubber spatula or spoon until a nice dough forms to shape the cookies roll the dough into one and a quarter inch balls cookies should be placed about three inches apart to give some room for spreading for the classic peanut butter cookie look dip a fork into granulated sugar and flatten each ball in a crisscross pattern I've heated my oven to 375 bake for about 10 minutes or until just light golden brown remove from the oven and let them stand for about five minutes and let them cool completely on a cooling rack there you have it peanut butter cookies perfectly baked chewy and delicious here's a new twist on this classic recipe that you'll find in the new edition of the Betty Crocker cookbook the flavors are very different and include a hazelnut spread with cocoa be sure to try stuffed hazelnut cookies with a yummy surprise filling inside you", "Bt-jpDWgnZU": "you [Music] Ashley we're here with Ashley runner barefoot in the kitchen the Valentine's Day is coming up but that doesn't mean you have to feel guilty about eating treats in fact you can cook

good that your kids are even going to love it except to one of mine did not last time if I'm Pedro but he's pretty picky okay so these are the ingredients really quickly we're going to go over we just need a half a cup of creamy peanut butter 1/3 cup of almond flour 1/4 a cup of honey a let's see of sorts of a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 of a teaspoon of vanilla extract one egg and I have a little bit of salt that we're gonna add and then we're going to do sprinkles so if you haven't guessed what we're cooking yet we're making a very chewy peanut butter cookies and this is what we're gonna do let's get started [Music] alright guys so after this is mixed up you're gonna pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and I'm just using a tablespoon measure because as still as you can see it's very sticky so I want them to just kind of dollop kind of in a round bowl on their own it's not your typical cookie consistency but I promise they turn out nice and fluffy and like traditional peanut butter cookies and then what we're gonna do to make these extra festive for Valentine's Day we just have some sprinkles so we're gonna use pink then you're gonna throw you can do a few sprinkles on

birdy I know that the Sun but just to be safe today now absolutely perfect we're look how beautiful they are they came out nice and fluffy we'll just kiss the music", "jClTAtPiSJI": "hi Phyllis here from southern Peru google.com this morning I'm going to make some peanut butter cookies now this is a very old recipe it comes out of the Betty Crocker cookbook from I'm not sure 5060 years ago I'm really not sure but anyway it's just a standard peanut butter cookies but here's the thing I'm gonna make my new jelly roll sheets or you can use them for cookies and I've got two of those now and then once again leave the link down below where you can go to my website and on products I highly recommend and click on that and you just click on the Amazon icon now with Amazon I think on these if you order twenty-five dollars worth of pans or whatever you get free shipping which works out great okay alright so this is mainly a demonstration of how to cook the cookies on the new stainless steel baking pans alright so we are ready to get started now first thing you'll need is 1/4 cup of Crisco or some type of shortening right four tablespoons of softened butter and I just do this in the microwave or 1/4 cup really a butter or margarine all right add to this we're going to add 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of regular sugar just jump that right in just use your spatula to kind of mix that in together you really don't need a mixer for this as it comes together pretty easily with just a spatula okay so next I'm going to mix in one whole egg that's a large egg I'm very anxious to try making cookies on my new little baking sheets and I'm about ready to order three of the bread little pans because I make um a bread and let me show you those pans here they are I haven't really used them all that much and they don't really look that bad but look around the edges these are coated with that nonstick kind of thing that I bought four pans when I bought these because I thought I could get poor in my oven I've got a small wall oven and but I can't get four in there so I've only ever been able to bake three loaves at one time so I'm only going to order three pans alright so needless to say I'm very excited about these stainless steel pans they just work super and by the way they are not made in China they are made in India alright brown sugar little blobs in there so I'll just set up a little better okay so now we're ready to add 1/2 cup of peanut butter now when the recipe for the peanut butter cookies came out in the bedding oh really old Betty Crocker cookbook the peanut butter was much thicker than this this is that all-natural you see it's kind of could be a little runny so what I actually did is use just a little less butter anticipating that this peanut butter is not as dry as the peanut butter was back in the 1960s I guess alright so now we're going to mix that in now I am using self-rising flour and that way I don't have to put any salt or baking powder and all I have to do is just use the all-purpose flour and this is white lily all-purpose flour and you will need one and one I actually used one in a third cups anticipating this all-natural peanut butter is a little has a little more oil in it but the red actual recipe calls for 1 and 1/4 cups of flour and if you want to use the all-purpose flour you won't need any salt or baking powder but if you use the all-purpose flour let me just read this recipe you will need 3/4 of a cup of baking soda excuse me not 3/4 of a cup 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt and that's if you use all-purpose flour so the best way to avoid that is just use self-rising and again I used 1 and 1/3 cups just because my peanut butter is all-natural and it's really got more oil in it all right so we got this all mixed in and now the only thing you need to do is add in your flour so I just add in about half of it get that next and I'm very excited that you see my new they're really gelly roll pens but I use them for cookie sheets now I've already baked a jelly roll and I did too it did have loaded a video on that and the other day I made biscuits and it works out great just really great for biscuits all right so we got about half that flour yeah now I'm going to go ahead and add the other half now here's what I'm hoping for what I make cookies really any kind of cookies now I prefer that they be kind of crunchy on the outside and kind of moist and chewy on the inside not so when you bite into them there they snap off I just I like mine not so crispy let's put it that way and I think these baking sheets are gonna make them that way for me because the bottom of them is a little bit thicker than ordinary you know there's coated pan of course you don't want them too thick because then they wouldn't get brown really good on the bottom I guess I don't know anyway all right so now here's what you need to do this needs to be in your refrigerator for about three hours and let it get good and cold now I cheat on that what I actually do let's put it in the freezer of my refrigerator which has the little fan of course and that way it gives cool really in about 30 minutes so that's what I'm gonna do but the recipe actually says to put it in the refrigerator for three hours alright so we're gonna put it in that freezer about thirty minutes and we'll be back alright we are back and the peanut butter cookies that I have never returned might have gotten a little too hard but we're gonna go with it anyway alright so I'm using a little melon scoop and I did spray that with some Pam so they'll come out easier now the recipe says to make balls 1 and 1/4 inches across and that's exactly what this scoop is 1 in 1/4 inches so we're just gonna plop those down on an ungreased baking sheet and in this case they're my new stainless steel gelly roll pens alright so far this little scoop is working out great I'll just kind of mash them around with my hand alright this is exciting alright I'm gonna have to stop I forgot to cut my oven off the oven has to be preheated to 375 degrees so I'm gonna have to stop and come back in a minute alright we're back and I'm still waiting for that oven to preheat to 375 degrees I have gone ahead and place the cookies on the cookie sheet so now to make that little crisscross which is you know very much like the original you know that our cookies you want to dip your fork in a flower I don't do one you can see I've got two pans or listed this panel there I'm sorry all right so you want to dip your fork just a regular table fork and mash it down a couple of times and then go back the other way so just mash them and then mash it the opposite direction each time you want to dip your fork down in the flour now these are the better cookies your mother probably made we made them in whole milk when I wasn't actually junior high school same recipe it's time to stick your fork down now you definitely have to see that one didn't work they're getting a little warm here just waiting for my oven to preheat now the original recipe says to place these three inches apart on the cookie sheet and I'm not struck that run exactly three inches apart some hoping they won't run together anyway this is the main purpose of this video is to be able to try out these new baking sheets and I'm thinking they're gonna work super because they work really great messed up again they really worked great on making the biscuits and dough making the jelly roll I was very very pleased because I had a problem with my biscuits sometimes burning on the bottom they are my biscuits baked at 450 degrees and the pan did not warp up or anything which I was very happy look I know hoping that the pan and will not do that on the cookies either all right so there one done and I'm gonna do this one and then I'm go put actually I'm going put this back in the refrigerator because you want to really cool when you put them in the oven all right so we'll just concentrate on this pan now and I am just gonna bake on one pan at a time let's see they're already getting a little warm by the way when the cookies on the cookie batter is really good in cold you can use that little melon screw that works out just great makes them exactly the right size might be ready now and I'm gonna bet these probably only about nine minutes now I messed up to just a deck on there because I want man chewy on the inside I don't want to you know all crispy I don't like them that way I prefer to have all my cookies a little moist it's a man just going back the opposite way with the fork you get you know the following there it's okay because there's enough oil in these little peanut butter cookies to take care of that all right I think we're ready okay all right so we're gonna go put these in the oven again we're gonna bake them at 375 degrees for really about nine minutes my oven only sets for every five minutes so what I'm gonna do is set my timer for nine minutes and when we get ready to take those up we'll be back and I'll let you see in the oven make sure this pan doesn't warp up all right my cookies are Donna yeah they are done I want you to see the pan it didn't warp up at all in the oven and the reason for that is because it's just enough to not do that all right let's take these over now we want to let these sit on the cookie sheet for about two minutes and we'll be back all right these cookies have cooled about two minutes so now I'm gonna take them off the cookie sheet now you do not need to grease your cookie sheet at all on this ungreased baking sheet now I like chewy not crispy so hopefully that's the way these are gonna be and put them over here upon the little cooling rack because if I get to a mop at one time now when I had it put the next pan of cookies in the oven now this recipe makes about three dozen so I'm going to get the other batter out of the refrigerator I'm sure it's going to be three dozen but I think it'll be close all right so I'll put these right in the same place these other cookies work now when I went to elementary school in a Grammar School in Virginia on the peninsula and it was called Copeland Park Elementary School now I was in the group of the first of the baby boomers born in 1945 and in the second grade we had to go in shifts and each class had about 40 students in it it's just were a lot of students because my dad worked in the shipyard there is - a lot of the other parents of students I went to school with and the peninsula was really a rich area because the tax base I guess was really big there because of the shipyard that was in Newport News Shipbuilding and dry dock company I think it's a full name and it's been sold I don't know really what the name is now but my brother still works for that company in Virginia but anyway what I wanted to tell you about was we had a lunch wagon that's what they called it that came around now in the second grade that we didn't get serve lunch because we were we went there in shifts and the first of the year I went there in the afternoon shift and then the next part of the year I went there in the morning shift we didn't we got out at lunchtime so they didn't serve us lunch but by the time I was in the third grade for someone all day and you know I think that my third grade class was probably 45 or 50 students it was amazing we were able to learn even with that many students and now they say oh we don't want but numbering 20 students per class so it worked for us we all well but anyway the lunch wagon would come around and one of the things that they served from that lunch wagon or what they call a lunch wagon it would come down the hall it was plugged in and at all the food on it and I think they were about three or four ladies that manned at the lunch wagon and one of the things we had was vegetable soup it was homemade vegetable soup and they would serve that with either a pear you know the little section on your little tray with a little of the juice or a peach and they would serve a little square of cornbread with that homemade vegetable suit and then we had a peanut butter cookie and they were they were not crispy at all they were so made and I guess that's why I like my cookies not crispy I like them not really gummy but you know moist in the middle and those are some fond memories of my grammar school days and again there were a lot of us because we were the beginning of the baby boomers and now we are the largest population in the United States that was born between 1945 and 1955 and I think some of y'all probably watched my channel so it would be interesting to know how many class coming students bring else classes because I don't think they had lost back then governing the number of students that could be in a class and it's amazing that we were all pretty smart and we didn't have any trouble learning across the discipline was much greater back then than it now and I can't ever remember anybody getting expelled from school ever for misbehaving all during my grammar school years and now I mean it's just sad the way things have turned out now for the children of course the 1950s were very innocent days they really were and I just making sure these are all grounded man I'd soon as my other cookies get done well pop things right straight in the up and again I had to bake these for about 12 minutes I'm gonna go ahead and taste of one of these and show you what I'm talking about lightly browned on the backside moist on the inside see they're not crispy which is exactly how I like them so on these pans in my oven at 375 degrees they need to be cooked about 12 minutes now if you want them crispy er than that you need to cook them a couple of minutes longer now you can get these pans on Amazon make this John that could be nice okay when you order from Amazon enough senators in my videos before but I just want to say together I mean the name of my website is southern frugal calm and what I'm gonna do is I'll put a link down below so you go to my website when you get on the website go to products I highly recommend and I'll put that down below too so you'll know and once you get on there you'll see the icons for Amazon for the pants now you'll probably see the cake pans but if you click on that on Amazon I will show you all the different pans now why am i recommending that first of all they're stainless steel they are everything that you think they're gonna be anymore okay it's from a company called nor Pro nor pro essentials I think it's the name now here's the deal and y'all listen very carefully because you need to learn some about Amazon from this when a company lists something on Amazon their contracts tells them that this product cannot be available anywhere else in the world for a price that's less than what it's listed on Amazon Amazon for said that in your mind now the next thing that you want No is who pass the postage now these particular pants if you order $25 worth of anything on Amazon you get free shipping now who pays for the free shipping the company that's who pays they're going to pay part of it so it really is to your benefit to order all of us anything from Amazon because of the way it works now there's a lot of controversy now about the taxes and a lot of the big stores I mean they went to Congress and everything tried one local states to charge sales tax for things that were purchased on Amazon and some do charge tax now but a lot of them don't so if you live in a state where they're not requiring tax to be charged by Amazon then you're in great shape okay so in in the town the the biggest town that I live close to its I don't know 25 or 30 thousand people that live in that town but anyway they have a Walmart and we have to pay 7% local tax on anything you buy and there other than groceries don't think the groceries are 1% in some of the other counties here in the state we pay 3% on anything that's non grocery and then 1% on the groceries so keeping that mad now again the whole thing is how you can get it the best quality product the cheapest kind of get my cookies and I'm gonna put these in while I've got the other door alright that was my 10-minute timer so they got two more minutes to cook hold on all right I want to get this out about Amazon so here's the deal if you find a product in a store cheaper than what it is on Amazon you need to simply report it because Amazon will make them lower that price to what it is in the story I don't care if it's on sale it doesn't matter if the price is lower Amazon does not allow them to undercut their price so that's the good deal for the consumer so if you're ordering pants like the pants I just showed you you're not gonna find them cheaper anywhere elves I don't care where it is because if they do Amazon will make them lower that price so just keep that men on anything you're ordering from Amazon now if you purchase enough like in this case it would be $25 and and when we were purchasing the pants - pants I think they were 13 something each and so you came up to $25 so we got free shipping now if you have to pay tax you'd have to pay tax no matter where you bought the pants right so there you go and you do have to wait I mean you buy it it might take two days for you to get them if you're living in this country if you're living ever sneeze I'm not sure how that would work but if you live in the United States almost anywhere you get them into certainly no more than three days I don't know maybe Alaska you wouldn't get them that quick but anyway you can wait then you know you've got the good deal now there's a lot of I want to just mention this when you're looking at reviews on Amazon that people have made keep this in mind they were all competitive okay and I sometimes think that competitors of different companies get people to post certain things because I know that happened with the little heater that we bought and we read those reviews and then we were questioning oh gee maybe I shouldn't get there just read all the way through them that on the pans when you look at the reviews go all the way down and look at some reviews that were made in September now one of the things on the reviews that they said if the pan would bumped up or warp up in the oven that's why I took you've of it there to see they don't warm up in the oven okay they cook great so anyway y'all just I promise you these pans are the best and at the absolute best price said go to my website go to products I highly recommend click on the little Amazon icon it'll take you right to the pan you can read everything about it but you just trust me there are really really good pans for the price all right I've got to go take that up and I'll be right back okay here are the cookies now I just want to say one more thing about the pans there it is they wipe off pretty clean because I'm gonna wash it with some soap and water you can put these right straight in the dishwasher and that will work for many many years now I want to show you a pan that I purchased him in 1960s and it was in my hope chest here it is now it's really really old and you see marks all over it and I don't know why those marks are on the back of it but you can actually feel them I probably put like fudge candy on there and cut it I'm just guessing I don't know what I did but I used to make brownies in this all the time and you can see all the scratch marks in it there's no rust on this pan and again it's from the 1960s okay all right so there are the cookies and we are done except for those they're in the oven I think I've got another egg so it didn't quite make three dozen but close all right so we'll see you next time well let's look at these cookies close up they are you know I don't want to show you that see you can slightly well you can't that one but you can slightly and denom that's the way I like them and he's cooked for 12 minutes and these these pans at 375 degrees now a shiny pen does not cook stuff on the bottom of it as fast as it does in a dark colored pan but dark color pens also burn on the bottom these are cooked perfect just like brown on the bottom around the edges all right we'll see you next time if you're going to order the pans go to that icon on my website alright see you next time", "k_pbiSn05ic": "hi I'm Stephanie Jewish gave joy baking calm today we're going to make peanut butter cookies so the first thing we need to do is if you have a stand mixer like this use a paddle attachment or you could just use an electric hand mixer but in the in your bowl place three-quarters of a cup that's a hundred and seventy grams of butter that's at room temperature I'm using unsalted butter as I like the flavor better but you could use the salted and I'm just going to beat this until it's nice and smooth and to that I'm going to add 1/2 cup that's a hundred grams of granulated white sugar and a half cup about 105 grams of light brown sugar and I'm just going to beat that until it's light and fluffy to three minutes scrape down the sides okay next add 3/4 of a cup that's what 185 grams of peanut butter now you can use either the smooth or the crunchy they say that women prefer smooth peanut butter while men prefer crunchy which is definitely the case in my house but I'm using the smooth here that's what I like so I'm just going to beat this in till it's all incorporated scrape down the sides as much as you need along the way to make sure all the ingredients are mixed together and next we're just going to add one large egg at room temperature and one teaspoon I like to use a pure vanilla extract better tasting than the imitation ones and just beat this until it's all incorporated and last we're going to take in a separate Bowl put two cups that's 260 grams of all-purpose flour and then I'm just going to add a half a teaspoon of baking soda to that and that out and a quarter teaspoon of salt now if you use salted butter I would leave out this salt and just whisk that together get that baking soda all mixed into the flour and then just add it to the our mixture here I'm just going to beat that until the flour is all incorporated into the batter and we're done now if you like you could fold in a half a cup about 80 85 grams of chocolate chips if you'd like or you could also add some about half a cup of chopped peanuts if you want even more crunch but I think I'm just going to leave it like this now just um this into a bowl and we're going to cover and chill this just until the batter is firm enough to roll into balls so maybe half hour an hour depending so into the fridge until chilled so now we'll make the cookies first pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius and then line two baking sheets with a parchment paper or you could just bother them or lightly spray em with a nonstick vegetable spray so to make the peanut butter cookies after your batter has been chilled we're just going to form them into 1-inch that's both 2 and 1/2 centimeter round balls eyeball it it's not that critical and just space the balls about a couple inches apart or 5 centimeters apart on your baking sheet and then peanut butter cookies always have most time have a crisscross pattern and how we do that is have a bowl of sugar and then a fork and then just press down well stick your fork like so okay and we're going to bake these for about ten minutes or just until the edges of the cookies start to brown so our peanut butter cookies are now done as you can see the outsides are just starting to turn brown these will give you a nice soft and moist peanut butter cookie if you like them a little more crisp just bake them a minute or two longer so let them cool completely you can cover and store these for several days at room temperature or you they can even be frozen so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of Joey baking calm", "OBDqHubV6iQ": "hi I'm Kevin I have no intention of filming a video this late at night it's already 9:30 p.m. but I suddenly had this inconsolable urge to eat peanut butter cookies okay I'm weird anyway guess what I am going to make for you first up preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit yeah these cookies are incredibly easy to make what you do is put 1 cup of creamy peanut butter in the bowl then add 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 large egg and then these next two ingredients are optional I'm going to add about a teaspoon this vanilla extract this is the extract that I made last summer oh it's wonderful has vanilla seeds in it and I'm also going to add just a tiny splash a pure almond extract this way the cookies will have a beautiful perfume and then stir and the cookie dough is going to seem very loose at first so just keep stirring and it was definite up yeah - already starting to get thick you'll know you're about there when your arm feels tired but you need the dough thick enough or stiff enough so that you can actually form the cookies and we are good to go next put a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and then to form the cookies take a small clump of the dough and roll it between the palms of your hands until you have a 1-inch diameter ball and in the comment section below tell me if you ever get late-night cravings and what if anything you do about them I'm going to finish these off and then I'll come right back alright I managed to form 24 little balls of dough on this cookie sheet so next flatten each one just slightly and then take a fork and for these to be proper peanut butter cookies we want to make crosshatch marks so you take the tines of the fork and make an indentation on each cookie going in one direction if you have kids in your house this would be a very fun project for them to do would be a very delicious project for them to do then turn the cookie sheet around and make indentations going in the other direction I'll give you a close-up in just a moment yeah these cookies are almost dangerously easy to do because once you've made them you might want to make them too often so here we go see the cross hatches I'm going to bake these in the preheated oven for exactly 15 minutes and here they are boy they really smell terrific I'm going to let them cool on the pan for oh five minutes and then I'll transfer them to this cooling rack for about ten minutes then we can have a taste show time these cookies are really amazing although they contain no flour they're gluten-free the edges are crispy and the inside is softened and wonderful and of course you can really smell the vanilla and the tiny bit of almond extract mmm or perfectly perfumed YUM all right I'm going to bring these cookies upstairs and Benji at least some of them while binge watching something ribboning on TV I hope you'll give the cookies a try again they're super easy to do and so delicious to eat and if you haven't subscribed to my youtube channel yet I hope you'll do so right now and be sure to tap the little bell icon so that you can receive notifications every time I upload a new video and what else do I want to say oh yes again if you have late-night cravings tell me what you crave and what you do about it food-related of course I'll see you next time and thank you so much for watching IV night", "zJGuuYCGtU4": "[Music] hello again everyone and welcome to another midweek snack i've got my bowl of various snacks here i did um a little refill got a couple new things in here but right up top my local store started selling these quest cookies now back in the back in the olden days now back in like you know college post college you know working out doing that sort of stuff then i pretty much relied on quest bars for my actual bar you know protein bar supplement bar and i liked them at the time because one they had interesting flavors two if you wanted to get real crazy and heat them up for like 10 15 seconds in a microwave it actually was kind of nice that way with a couple of them and then three they had the highest protein count in a bar at the time like it was like 24 grams or 25 grams or whatever and that was substantial because everything else on the market was severely less than that and yes i'm not here to debate how many grams of protein your body can process in a normal day's time my point was is that i could get away with maybe eating a bar maybe not doing protein shake blah blah it didn't really matter so anyway quest makes a couple of other products now obviously they have their their protein powder line which i've tried it's fine um they have chips which at some point i'll probably bring on here too but they're they're a little pricey and then cookies so everybody likes a cookie i like a good nice like like crunchy cookie i'm not a huge like soft cookie kind of guy but i do like a nice a nice crunchy cookie that i can dip in milk and i just never had the opportunity to buy them i'm well i've had the opportunity i've just never felt like it but they were in my local store they had a deal on them and i figured hey i'll get two that sound interesting so automatically peanut butter love peanut butter cookies and then the double chocolate chip we're gonna do the peanut butter because peanut butter is awesome so here we go with the peanut butter quest cookie 15 grams of protein one gram of sugar and five net carbs that's the other thing too quest was always um really low on sugar and you know when i when i get a protein powder when i get a bar i don't want a bunch of sugar i want as little sugar as humanly possible i'm eating this as like a post-workout thing and and you know i don't want to pound sugar so here are some of the nutritional facts 220 big calories in that cookie and oh ingredients list is down below if you're interested in that let's go ahead and open this bad boy up kind of looks like a sugar cookie it doesn't have the crossing you know where you take the fork and you cross the peanut butter cookie what are they doing nice underside there that's dense hmm it's interesting um there is something there's something in there that's not quite nice i'm trying to figure out what it is i don't know if i'm going to be able to you know it's not that it's not nice it's that it doesn't feel right in a peanut butter cookie it's almost like cheesecake yeah i don't know i don't know how to describe that i feel like i'm a little bit of a loss for words um i wouldn't buy that again you know it definitely has a lot of peanut butter taste in there but there's something in there that is giving it a strange aftertaste or like a strange kind of like front end taste as you're really chewing into that thing and then there's almost like a fake sugar aftertaste you know like you get with like stevia i'm not gonna relook it might even have stevia in it but yeah i i don't know it it's it's trying to be a peanut butter cookie but it's not quite a peanut butter cookie amazing source of protein and i'm sure that there are a lot of people that would like that for me uh i'm hoping that the double chocolate chip is better that's what i'll say for that um yeah it's a little bit of a letdown but what are you gonna do so anyway folks hopefully you enjoyed please make sure to like comment and subscribe and we will catch you on the next one see ya", "RyiVx3C5l4A": "(upbeat music) - Hey munchies, welcome to\nthe channel if you're new or if you're not I'm\nAlyssia and I'm stoked you're here either way. I have surprisingly\nhad a lot of people say can you do a video that\nshows healthy convenience store snacks, like gas stations snacks. I don't know why I'm surprised by this but I kind of thought gas stations and convenience stores\nhave a lot of options. So, I was confused about why\npeople really wanted this video and I started to think about it. I have some thoughts I'm gonna share. But my first thing I would\nadvise when asking yourself this question or asking anyone\nthis question, because you're on the hunt for healthy,\nconvenience source snacks is, why? So really knowing what is your goal and why are you gonna\nthe convenience store, is it because you're on the road? Are you just, you know, driving\nhome from school or what? So if you're on the road,\nwhich is usually when I go to a convenience store or gas station, that was kind of my\napproach to this video, is it because you're on Whole30\nand paleo that it's hard? Is it that you're trying to be healthy? Is it because you're\nafraid of eating bad foods? Are you experiencing some guilt or or are you judging yourself? You know, all of these kinds\nof change the intention behind why you want healthy\nconvenience store snacks and that intention will\nimpact your experience. So if this is a matter of you wanting healthy convenience store snacks\nbecause you're on the road, and any of those other things\nI just listed are true. My next question would be how frequently are you really on the road? Because if this is something\nlike for me, I don't, especially in coronavirus\ntimes, I don't travel a lot. There's not that many\nopportunities that I have to go into a convenience store and find a snack. So when I do, I kind of\nknow it's not forever. And do I really need to get\nso worked up over what it is. Again if I was doing Whole30\nor something, then yeah it would make sense, but you\nsee how this intention matters. So the truth is, it's\nactually not hard at all to find something healthy\nat a convenience store. And if you start with the fridge, that's gonna be your best bet for fresh, you know, regarding healthy. So whole fruit bananas, oranges, apples, you're almost always gonna find those. And in the actual refrigerator section they usually have like\nchopped, fresh fruit. I went to a 7-Eleven for this video and all the snacks I'm\ngonna show you today are from a 7-Eleven, but they\nhad, you know, chopped fruit that was mixed like the box I got here but they also had melons and grapes. They had some chopped salads and you know, a lot of times you can\nalso find like celery with peanut butter or boiled eggs. My store didn't have those but those are things\nyou can typically find in the refrigerator at a gas station. Uh cheese, I also found cheese and you know, prosciutto sticks and baby bells and that kind of stuff. That could be a great source of protein especially if you're\non the road and looking for something that will keep\nyou satisfied for longer. Now, here's what I realized\nas I started to contemplate why do people really want this video? So what's hard walking\ninto a convenience store is not finding something\nhealthy, it's deciding not to get something\nunhealthy, because we walk in and we're exposed to like a\nheaven of processed foods. It's just like so much stimulus. And I just want to eat\nall of these things. And why would I want to\npick up an apple when they have Doritos, you know,\nand all the good stuff. So I think the challenge\nis really mental, right? This is mind over munch. It keeps showing up every day. The challenge is walking\ninto the gas station and choosing something healthy. This is a valid concern and\nshould still be addressed. So if you feel like\nyou're forcing yourself to choose something that you don't want, it might be worth it to\njust pick the thing you want and give yourself permission to eat it. I did an entire video about the power of permission\nwith food last year and I'll link that below\nif that calls to you. If I go to a gas station and I need and I want or need to get a snack I'll first check in with my inner wisdom. If you don't know what\ninner wisdom is check out that video first so you\nknow what I'm talking about but essentially asking in,\ntuning in how hungry am I? Am I hungry? Am I just bored? You know, a lot of times\non road trips, I am bored. It's actually okay to\neat when you're bored and it's okay to eat junk\nfood because you feel like it. The question is what\nresonates with your body and heart and mind in\nthis moment considering the big picture of any health efforts you may be making or setting\nintentions around, right? So if you're like, well right now I'm doing Whole30 specifically to learn about what resonates with my body. Then yeah, it serves you\nto get really intentional. But if you're just like, ah I feel so guilty if I eat that food and it's coming from that\nplace of judgment, I would say take a step back and think\nabout why this matters to you. So after I check in with my inner wisdom then I can work out to the outer wisdom which is like the nutrition knowledge. So when it comes to outer\nwisdom, I personally will look more at ingredients\nof a snack these days in my life than I will\nthe macro nutrients. So the main thing I'll look\nat on the label is added sugar because added sugar provides\nno nutrition at all. Again, that doesn't mean that\nyou shouldn't or can't eat it. It's just, if I'm trying to\nmake a very intentional choice considering outer wisdom,\nI would personally look at added sugar, for instance,\nover calories or even fat. So throughout this video I'm gonna go through these snacks. The intention was choosing cleaner items. And by clean, I am defining\nclean as less processed, not good. This is not about, you\nknow, morality in food. I like the word clean because\nit just is a quick way to nod to being less processed. If you don't like the word you can replace it with whatever you like. I'm not saying, you know these foods are good in\nthese foods are bad, okay? So what else is there to eat\nat a convenience store besides fruit and cheese if you're\ntrying to make a healthy choice. Also from the fridge section,\nthese Sabra Snackers, okay? I love this. They're crunchy salty, satisfying. You get the protein from the hummus and you kind of get the\nprocessed food from the pretzel. So it's kind of like\nthe best of both worlds but you get a little bit\nof nutrition out of it. Oka, these kind of refrigerated smoothies, this is Mighty Mango Naked. This one, I just pretty much\nlooked in the refrigerator and this was the one\nthat had no added sugar. It does have, you know,\n68 grams of carbohydrates, 57 grams of sugar, but\nit's not added sugar. That being said it is a lot of fruit. I've joked about this\non the channel before when I did a video about\njuices and this has one and a quarter mangoes,\none and three quarters apples a half an orange, a\nthird of a banana, right? Like, would you eat\nthat much fruit at once? Probably not. That being said, it's\nstill a cleaner choice. So you do you. Okay, Pickled Bites. Yum, I've never seen these before. I was actually surprised how\nmuch healthy stuff they had at this 7-Eleven, but it's\nliterally just pickles. I think they're deal flavored\npickles in a bag, like that's awesome. Alright, so these were some\nlike fruit snacks that did not have added sugar into them. They were just the fruit. So these crispy apple chips, the only ingredient is apples, right? I might not want an apple on the road but if I want a crunchy, you\nknow, processed-like snack then here you go. Maybe that will satisfy you, maybe not. These Orchard Blend, Sweet Persimmon, Tart Apple and Tangy Peach dried chews. The only ingredients are\npeaches, apples, and persimmons. You can't get any\ncleaner than that really. So, and then this is apples fruit squeeze. It's not called apple sauce because actually it's\nnot just apples pureed, this is apple juice concentrate. So that is gonna have\na little bit more sugar but it's not added. So another great gas\nstation food is popcorn. So this is just, you know,\nregular sea salt popcorn. The only ingredient, popcorn,\nsunflower oil and sea salt. I don't know if this\none is air fried or not but you could always look for air fried if you're looking for lower and fat this one's probably not because\nthere's nine grams of fat. And then these Popcorner chips, only ingredients are yellow,\ncorn, sunflower oil and salt. And the White Cheddar Smartfood. I love this stuff so much. It's actually not as bad\nfor you as you might think. And I talked about this in\nmy healthy processed foods video or low, you know,\nI did a video last year about processed foods that\nhave minimal ingredients. So if that's what you're looking for, when you're looking at,\nyou know, gas station foods watch that video because\nI go through a lot of surprising processed\nfoods that have just a couple of ingredients. And this one I compare\nspecifically to, they have like, what is it a Smartfood 100 where it's like a hundred calorie Smartfood\npop compared to this one. And that one has way more ingredients. And it's actually not that\nmuch lower in calories. It's like nominal when you weigh it out. And I actually show you this side by side. While talking, you know, super processed, these are other ones that\nI've mentioned in the healthy processed or low\ningredient processed foods video. Pork rinds, okay? Pork rinds are almost always just gonna be fried pork skins and salt, right? Or, you know oil if they're fried. I don't personally love\nthe taste of pork rinds, but a lot of people do and\nit's actually a cleaner food. Chips, now Baked Lays\ndo have more ingredients but they have less fat\nbecause they're baked. These Lays only have\npotatoes, oil and salt. That's three ingredients. It could be worse, right? So like you have to decide\nwhat's worth it to you. And again, why are you, why\nare you getting this snack? Are you really just like wanting a crunchy delicious thing on the\nroad then why are you gonna force yourself\nto get the apple chips, when are these really\ndoing that much damage? I don't know. I would argue no. I would argue personally now\nmy feeling is the stress. I used to get so stressed\nout about this stuff. The stress that I would\nput my body and mind under, choosing something I didn't want because I was trying to be healthy, actually physiologically that\nstress did my body more damage than just eating the chips. That's me personally, okay? And then pretzels, pretzels are always. I love pretzels so much, you\nknow, it's a could be worse it's could be worse kind of food. Like they don't have too many ingredients. Yeah, it's white flour. It's enriched, but it could be worse. Nuts and seeds are another\ngreat choice that you can find at almost any convenience store. And if you are trying to be\npaleo or Whole30 or whatever, this is probably where you\nshould head to be safe. Watch out though,\nespecially if you're doing a strict elimination\ndiet like the Whole30. You can't eat peanuts for\ninstance, there are legumes, but most nuts are, a lot of\nnuts are fried in or roasted in peanut oil, so you have to check. And sometimes it'll say\nlike canola or peanut oil and you don't know which so\nit's not technically compliance. That gets really tricky. But for the most part,\nyou know, nuts are nuts. What I will say about the\nnut situation is if you go in shell or raw, it's\ngonna be your cleanest bet. Same goes for sunflower\nseeds in the shell. You can't get any cleaner than that. When it starts to come to flavoring, okay? So like these peanuts are salt and lime. The ingredients list gets longer. There's sugar and corn syrup,\nsolids and dextrose, right? And maltodextrin, whatever. There's more stuff in it\nis it the end of the world? If there is some stuff in your\npeanuts and you like them, lime flavored, that's up to you. Like me, I hate raw almonds. I will never eat a raw almond. It just tastes disgusting to me. These Wasabi Bold Almonds, I love these. They're so freaking good. They're not clean. They're not clean at\nall, but they're tasty. And really, you know, it's, I mean, they're not clean but they've\ngot one gram of added sugar. To have sugar is the main\nthing you're looking out for. You can still have a\ndelicious, crunchy snack where you know you're getting some nutrition. Uuhm these Love Corn. I don't know this brand,\nI've never had it before but any kind of like roasted\ncorn snack like this, the only ingredients are\nusually corn and oil and salt. This one also has habanero chili. One other thing I wanted\nto bring attention to was trail mixes, because\nthis is something else you can find at a gas station. And usually this is what trail, I guess trail mixes are technically\nlike for the trail, right? Like you go on a hike, you go on a trail and you've got this like mix\nthat'll keep you satisfied. Well, you know, on a car trip\nis sort of the same thing. If you don't have access\nto a food for a while, then a trail mix should\nkeep you satisfied. Here's the thing, you\nprobably already know this if you're watching this\nchannel, most trail mixes especially if they have\ndried fruit in them they have a lot of added sugar. This is so sneaky. Look at these two packages, which one looks healthier to you? Right, yeah, I mean, you\ndecide for yourself, but yeah this one looks like the branding\nmakes it look healthier. Like look at all these\nhealth claims, protein no artificial colors or\nflavors, no preservatives low sodium, blah, blah, blah. But then you look at the\nadded sugar of each of these. So this one just looks like\na regular old thing of, you know, nut and fruit mix. This one has one gram of added sugar and this one has eight. It's from the cranberries. Usually cranberries are\ngonna have added sugar. This one only has one gram\nof added sugar though. So I would actually pick this one and the ingredients are\njust as clean, right? So you have to read the label and don't go based on\nthe sneaky marketing. That being said maybe you\nwant really sweet cranberries in your trail mix, you know. Eating at a gas station is not forever. At least if you're going\non a road trip, I mean you're not gonna die from\neating some added sugar on your cranberries,\nor even from, you know picking the honey bun or the powdered sugar\ndonuts that I like to eat at a gas station, right? Like maybe when you're on a road trip this is the one time you get\nto indulge in eating some of those, you know, nostalgic\ngas station favorites, that you don't let\nyourself have very often or that you don't have the\nopportunity to have very often. So for me, giving myself permission in those contexts to say, no this is when I really want to\nhave the powdered sugar donuts and enjoy them fully. That's what works for me. The next go-to at a gas station or convenience store would be\nlike protein or meat snacks. So Jerkys is what a lot of people go for for a healthy snack. To be honest, the 7-Eleven I was at had no clean Jerkys at all. There are clean Jerkys now. Like it used to be you couldn't find a jerky without added sugar. You can find it now,\nbut not at my 7-Eleven. So these, are both, you know,\none has seven grams of sugar. The second ingredient is sugar. The Turkey Jerky has\nonly four grams of sugar but the second ingredient or maybe it's third\ningredient is still sugar. The Turkey Jerky has a really long a much longer ingredients list. So by the kind of arbitrary\nrule I gave you at the beginning of the video where I said, I\ngo by ingredients, you know and I look at sugar, whatever, I'm kind of breaking that rule because I would actually\npick this one over this. Why would I pick it? I like the way it tastes. I actually prefer the taste and texture of Turkey jerky, right? So this is the point you guys, there are no rules and any rule,\nhard and fast rules you set around food are only\ngonna make you miserable. They only made me miserable. I should speak from my\nexperience, huh, okay. These rules made me miserable and letting go of the rules\nthat like, I can only eat it if there's this much sugar\nor not, and this can't exist on the label or it has to\nbe this many, whatever. All that stuff drove me nuts. At the end of the day,\nit's one snack, okay? It's one snack on one car\ntrip, pick the one you want. This beef steak thing,\nthis looks so disgusting. I've never eaten one of these, but I had to get it\nbecause it was an option. So it's pretty much just\nas bad as the jerky. I mean, not as bad, it\nhas two grams of sugar but has a bunch of, Oh, it has MSG in it. Ooh, it's probably good. This Ahi Tuna Jerky Strip. I've never seen this or tried it before but I was impressed. It doesn't have any added sugar. The ingredients are\npretty clean and you know, it's a good option for a\nlow, moderately low calorie. It's a hundred calories,\nhigh protein, clean snack. You can also buy tuna at the gas station. Who knew 7-Eleven sold\nlike regular chunk tuna. Now this is not, I would\nsay this is probably not ideal to like get in\nyour car and eat this. Unless you have a, a can\nopener in the middle console, then it's not gonna be\nfeasible or easy to eat. But this little Wild Tuna\nMeal Kit, 7-Select brand which I think that's\n7-Eleven brand, right? It's, you know, pretty clean. I mean, it's got crackers. So, you know, if there's\nenriched flour in there, but this could be a good way to\nget a satisfying protein snack. They also of course have a whole\nlike aisle of protein bars. I haven't eaten protein\nbars in a couple of years but I was like, oh my gosh, there are so many protein\nbars now, most of them, I wouldn't, I just wouldn't eat them because I don't like the way they taste. Protein bars don't fill me up. But I wanted to at least\npick one up for the sake of the video, because of\ncourse it's an option, right? And depending on your health\ngoals and your food freedom it might be the right choice for you. I grabbed this. I don't actually like the way these tastes but they had the best,\nthe best ingredients. You know, it's like six\ningredients and it's pretty clean. Personally, I would\nprobably eat the baby bell or the cheese stick which\nhe gives me, two of these would give me as much protein in this. And it tastes way better. The other thing about protein bars, I said that they don't fill me up. They don't fill me up\nphysically, but also mentally. So a lot of times I eat them and I still feel like\nI haven't eaten food. So if I'm really hungry I wanna\neat something where my mind and body both know, okay, I ate. And if I'm wanting to eat a processed food and I'm just like, oh,\nthe protein bar kind of like satisfies the process, you\nknow, food itch or whatever. It doesn't for me anymore. It used to, now I want the real deal. I want, you know, the donuts\nor the chips or whatever. So I couldn't go into a gas station without buying a candy bar, right? So I have a Twix bar here and\nI also have this healthier Hu, Hu, Hu Get Back To Human Chocolate. So it's dark chocolate. I don't like dark chocolate. It's also organic, 70%\ncacao, vegan, paleo. I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm not a chocolate person. I like Twix bars, I like snicker bars, but not because I like chocolates 'cause of all the other good stuff in it. So, this would bring me no joy. Would it bring you joy? Maybe if you're someone\nwho likes dark chocolate, I would rather have the Twix bar. So again, intention here matters. If your intention is\ntrying to satisfy a deep desire to have a Snickers bar, right? This is probably not gonna do it. And this is why a lot of times\nwe can eat these substitutes and then still feel hungry or unsatisfied mentally and physically. But if you're just like, no,\nI really like dark chocolate and I really want a square\nof it to just, you know, have a little sweet after\nmy lunch or whatever then maybe it satisfies you. The only way to know is to\ntune into your inner wisdom. No one outside can tell you. Okay and the last snack is\nnot one I would recommend for if you want to eat\nhealthy at a convenience store but I saw them and I\ncouldn't not buy them. So I figured I'd buy it and taste it. These are pop tart bites. I couldn't resist. So there's 40 grams of sugar\nand 41 grams of added sugar. Oh my gosh, look so cute. Smell your food before you\neat it it'll taste better. There's your mindfulness tip. Oh my God, hmm. It tastes exactly like\nyou think it would taste. It's perfect, oh my gosh, that's so good. It's like a miniature\nPop-Tart that's almost better because there's a better\nratio of like icing, icing to cookie or pastry\nor whatever mixture than on a regular side Pop-Tart. Oh, these are so good. Not recommended if you're\ntrying to eat healthy at a convenience store, but\nI went to a convenience. I went to 7-Eleven and I saw them and I could not get them, so. So, that is the spread. I literally walked into a 7-Eleven. I was like, how many\nhealthy items can I get? This is what I found. I hope that it, you know,\nsupports your journey in some way. The goal was not for me to tell you these are the snacks to\nget, it was to help you really start to investigate\nwithin yourself. What are my intentions here, right? Like why does this matter to me? Just my own experience. I spent so much time, so many\nyears causing myself stress and distress around food and health and trying to make the right choice and then choosing what\nI didn't actually want because I thought I\nwas doing my body right and I was actually causing\nnot just like mental stress, but physiological stress\nin my body, dysregulation. I couldn't lose weight no\nmatter how many calories I ate because of that stress. So this is my mission here is\nto help you not stress so much about food and health, because so much of what we thought mattered\nreally doesn't matter that much, if our stress isn't under control.

ingredient here is about a half a cup of sugar and we're going to use this half a cup of sugar to roll your cookie dough peanut butter balls in right after we finish putting them together now let's get started okay i have here this kitchenaid and i didn't think that i would use this very often but i love how this comes together so the first thing we're going to do here we're going to cream in the peanut butter put that in there make sure i get it all out i don't want to have a little bit lacking okay and then we're going to add in the cup of brown sugar and then we're going to add in the cup of white sugar and then we're going to add in the cup of softened butter remember the softened butters equals to two sticks of butter okay now we're going to mix this up i'm going to put it on low and it only takes a couple of minutes to mix this up nice and creamy and then i'll be right back okay uh our two minutes are up and as you can see it's nice and creamy the next thing we're going to do is add in the eggs one at a time and one of the other things i want to mention to make sure you don't forget is to scrape down the sides periodically maybe every 30 or 40 seconds scrape down the sides and then let that mix you can put it on medium and let the eggs mix mixing the eggs takes very very short time so you don't have to worry about doing that very long and now i'm going to add in the other egg let that mix for about 20-30 seconds until it's nice and creamy as you can see that's mixing nice and creamy now while i'm uh doing this i'm going to stop so that i can scrape down the sides you want to remember to do that take the time to scrape down the sides and you only have to do this once or twice during the time that you're uh your beaters beating that up just once or twice i'll do it and then let that mix up again and now that's actually all you need right there that's thoroughly mixed now we're going to add in the flour ingredients but there's something that i wanted to mention about this the flour mixture has as i said a teaspoon of baking soda and a teaspoon of baking powder now you want to add your baking soda and your baking powder to your flour mix you want to mix this up thoroughly take at least 30 to 40 seconds to mix that up now i want you to know also there was a particular time when i was making uh peanut butter cookies and i did not add the soda and the baking powder to the flour i actually waited until i got the flour mixed into the peanut butter and then i added the soda and salt now i've seen lots of recipes where they actually add the sodas salt or baking powder now we don't have any salt in this recipe but i have seen them where they mix the salt soda and baking powder right into the wet ingredients but my experience has been where it actually i could taste uh like clumps in different areas in the peanut butter cookies where there was too much soda or too much salt so now i just completely mix the uh baking soda and baking sod baking powder up in the flour and then i add it to my bowl so what we're going to do here next is take a little bit of flour at a time you don't want too much because this one thing i've learned about the kitchenaid it'll blow flour everywhere if you turn it on too high so we're just going to put about a cup in there or actually that's a half a cup lock that up and then let that mix that up now this is gonna take probably about three or four maybe even five minutes to get that all mixed up guys so i will mix that up and i'll be back okay guys now our mixture with that one half cup of flour mixture is pretty creamy but the next thing you want to do before you add any more flour is get a teaspoon one teaspoon of vanilla add that in there and then you can continue on but you mix that before you add any more flour that's only going to take probably about i don't know 20 seconds it won't take more than that and then we'll add more flour it's nice and creamy that's good enough the mix of the vanilla so now we're going to add some more flour and i'm only adding this smaller amounts is because if you add too much flour with the kitchenaid i usually have flour everywhere so you just want to take your time see there you turn it up too high it will go everywhere but you can mix it slowly and then once it gets the flowers pretty much in there then you can turn that up to medium that's exactly what i just did all right guys what i'm gonna do i'm gonna finish adding all the flour and then i'll be back to finish this recipe for you okay um now we're at the point where i want to show you how to uh make these soft batch cookies the one thing i want you to remember i said at the beginning of the video that there was a a secret and actually it wasn't a secret it was an accident when i was making these cookies i had been searching for a soft batch peanut butter cookie and i had tried so many different recipes and they just weren't soft enough so i came up with this idea i said joyce just put in maybe a quarter of a cup less flour just to try it out and that's exactly what i did so this recipe is actually a quarter of a cup less flour now here's the next thing i want you to remember as you can see here's the cookie dough now uh at this point you can actually pop on your oven if you haven't already preheated it preheat it at 350 and by the time your oven is done preheating you can take this out of the refrigerator which means you're going to set this in the refrigerator for five minutes that's all you need and i have done that and that causes the dough to kind of set up a little better because if you handle it uh before then then it's not it's kind of sticky so you just want to take a heaping teaspoon dump it in your flour mixture roll that around i should have rolled that first but i'll show you on the next one i got some started over here and i'm making up about 12 at a time because that's what's gonna fit uh on my cookie sheet about 12 at a time so i'm gonna take that roll that up you can handle it it's not too sticky not too tacky roll it in your sugar and put it on the plate and again i'm going to do about 12 of those because my cookie sheet will hold about 12 this size another thing this recipe is supposed to make about four dozen cookies of course that depends on the size that you make them so you might get four dozen you might get a little less and if you make them pretty tiny you'll probably get more than that but again we just roll those cookie dough balls in sugar i'm gonna do one more it's real simple like i said about take about a heaping teaspoon full roll that dough roll it in sugar and i'm putting it on a plate now we're gonna take this over here and we're going to place these on the cookie sheet you're going to take your fork just the tip of it and you're going to press that out just like that i'm not good at making the crisscrosses i just put the crosses on there flatten it out a bit and we're going to add the rest as i said i use about 12 per cookie sheet and as you can see that's really really simple just remember that when you finish with your dough you pop it in the refrigerator for five minutes you don't have to leave it longer than that that's about the time it takes for your oven to preheat and then we roll them out put a crisscross on them and then you're going to bake these in your oven for six to seven minutes no longer than seven minutes now they're gonna look like they're not done but they are done i assure you so make sure you remove them from your oven by seven minutes no longer pop that into the oven set your timer for seven minutes and voila now i'm going to uh let these cook and then i'm gonna come back and show you the most amazing soft batch cookies be right back guys the cookies are coming out now as you can see they look perfectly beautiful now remember this part is the fun part as soon as it comes out of the oven while it's still hot be careful do not burn yourself make sure you don't get too close but you can drop the reese's pieces onto your cookies and you can use as few as you want or as many as you want five should be sufficient you don't want to overdo it because then you'll get too much sweet taste but i usually put about five or six on mine as you can see they get a little bit bigger once you bake them but you just drop these on there and after you put your reese's pieces on there remember to let your cookies cool for about five minutes before you put them onto the paper towel otherwise they are nice and soft while they're hot as most of you know they will break so make sure you give them at least five minutes to cool before transporting them onto your paper towel because i've got some paper towels set up over here on my table and that's where i'm going to put these at but while i'm showing you this you can see how simple that is just put your few chips in there be careful not to burn yourself press them down just a little bit don't press them a lot because they're really hot and the chips will kind of melt into the cookie as you will see as soon as you put them on there and now that i've gotten all my chips on there i want to take you over here larry will turn around and see the cookies that we've already done okay these are the ones that i took out about 10 minutes ago they're nice they're not fragile that's why you have to let them sit up because if you don't they will break but i want you to see watch how soft they are um watch this absolutely amazing now if i can chew this up fast enough i want to tell you a story about why i know that these are the most amazing peanut butter cookie cookies ever my daughter my oldest daughter she doesn't eat peanut butter and she does not like peanut butter cookies every holiday i make cookies all the different varieties for christmas presents for a lot of my family members because they love my baking but she came over one day when i was making some peanut butter cookies and she sat down and i know that she doesn't like peanut butter cookies so it didn't even you know phase me that she might want to try one and she said mom those smell so good i said but you don't even eat peanut butter cookies every year you only ask for chocolate chip she said well let me try one so i gave her one and she tried it long story short her favorite cookie now is peanut butter cookies and she said mom don't make me anything else i just want the peanut butter cookies so she started to take the cookies off the table and she must have eaten at least five or six that day but from then on her favorite cookie was peanut butter cookies so i hope that you guys like this video if you like our videos like and subscribe and i hope to see you again real soon happy holidays i hope you have had a great thanksgiving bye now okay guys there is the finished product [Music] you", "VHksA8O0ddM": "hey guys today I'm gonna be showing you how to make the best peanut butter cookies on the face of the planet let's get started first you're gonna need 1 and 1/4 cup of flour 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter 1/2 a cup of Crisco 1/2 cup of light brown sugar 1/2 cup of granulated sugar a large egg and half a bag of Reese's peanut butter chips ok the first thing you want to do is to pre-heat your oven to 350 easy ok first we're gonna mix our dry ingredients together and then set them aside I'm gonna grab a small goal get my flour dump my salt and baking soda in there grab a whisk and just mix everything make sure everything is nice so I decide for later now we want to grab the sugars the peanut butter and the Crisco put that bad boy in there get your brown sugar the peanut butter these are my favorite cookies every time I make that they're just the biggest hit I've never had a peanut butter cookie that taste so please cheap iron horn blend everything until it's completely combined medium speed for about a minute okay now we're gonna add our 1/2 teaspoon extra-large egg straight the sides of this bowl because this next blending is gonna be even longer than the first time I'm sorry let's go we're gonna blend until this batter turns from this light brown to a milky creamy beige is gonna be amazing and may take two or three minutes but we're gonna keep going you can take your time but they just go slow make sure all the batter is getting some love in here keep it light and steady this is the color that went from peanut butter it's a creamy beige let's grab the flour and we're gonna fold it into the wet ingredients so get your spatula taking the bottom of the batter and you're folding it on top of the flour the reason why you want to do this before you blend everything with the electric mixer is because the flour will puff up and go everywhere if you don't and I have like to avoid messes as much as possible let's start on a low speed and work away we're gonna win until the dough starts lump together so you wanna make sure the batter it's clumping together and not sticking to the second hole and then it'll be perfect and already the peanut butter chips let's take off this list let's pour in trypsin get your spatula and fold those Pamela chips into the mix got yourself a big baking sheet like this one and then we're gonna start really beautiful guide it sticking in there don't be scared I am getting this much dough and just squishing about it together making a nice little firm ball I am gonna place each ball of dough about one and a half inches to two inches apart from each other the best thing about these cookies is that they already in place to do it so you don't have to spray the cookie sheet at all these cookies are not a mistake I've done is plate up and you're an adult and you can't eat it does it take some saucy not that I ate it ok these guys are ready to go in the oven I'm gonna put them in there for 14 minutes they got little cracks in them as you can see the top are golden brown the person that this guy's chill for 10 to 15 minutes and then they're done for yourself a glass of hope and a joy thank you guys so much for watching this video I really appreciate it give this video a thumbs up if you liked it leave a comment down below and tell me some recipes that you want me to try and please subscribe for some more videos peanut butter cookies", "0nalyEGpuSs": "Hey Alton Brown here in the now almost completely deserted good eats Test Kitchen Hey they closed all the schools so all those kids are home so you're gonna need some cookies right just to keep them quiet you know come on so this is kind of a good news/bad news cookie the good news is incredibly simple made with very few ingredients that you probably have sitting in your pantry right now also good news gluten free all right there's no flour in this I'm not I don't really care about that but I know that a lot of people do the bad news is if you're allergic to peanuts and I know a lot of kids like my daughter are well you can't have these but I'm not allergic to peanut butter or peanuts so that means I can eat more of these and there's the good news although that's just gonna make me fat so that's bad okay let's just make cookies so I have a peanut butter 268 grams smooth peanut butter it's just Jeff okay nothing special it's just somebody will pick that out I also have two different sugars light brown sugar and regular granulated sugar 120 grams of each that would basically be half a cup of each but of course the brown sugar would be packed and I really don't like measuring that way because one person's fact is another person's semi unpacked so let's just go 120 grams I have one egg we're also going to use one teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of vanilla extract and a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt I arrange things very often from the higher amount to the lower amount because it helps me to memorize the recipes which I like to do so 268 121 1-1 1/4 great all right now the oven I have set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit yes we could do that in metric but I'm not thinking that way yet so let's just say 350 rack is in the middle the only tools that we're going to need bowl for mixing and some mixing utensils we're gonna go old-school with just the the wooden spoon and I'm also going to use a Disher to distribute these I want one ounce portions I'm going to them and see if I hit one ounce but having a Disher is gonna make that a lot easier and I've got a little spatula because this stuff is sticky and you need a spatula when stuff is sticky so the first thing that we're going to do peanut butter goes in first please don't make any jokes about how that looks there we go the sugar both sugars go in and then just kind of work this around I suggest you make children that's my suggestion is you make children do this and I would say that you know it's all about teaching them to value things and that if you want the cookie you I don't have to make the cookie but really it's just about making them do work so that you can go off and do something else like the good old days when we made children to do work around the farm same thing now that they're home and in your face all day long all day long they should have to do something all right now here I'm gonna scrape off my spoon see you always need a spatula always need a little rubber spatula and I'm gonna work this now we're just kind of at the back of the spoon and this is almost like imitating the creaming method where you're kind of punching holes and the peanut butter they're gonna make a hole for the egg now is a good time to also add the baking soda this is not baking powder this is baking soda one teaspoon go I'm also gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla extract don't do that over the bowl just in case you spill it there we go last thing is the salt we're only gonna go with a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt and stir to combine and we want this really smooth let's just fast-forward through this part and that is what your dough should look like at this point this could be refrigerated for you know what who cares we would make cookies right away wouldn't wait to do so we're gonna need two cookie pants or two sheet pans these are half sheet pans we use a lot of these here and in the good eats Test Kitchen because we like them and they're cheap and they're aluminum so we're gonna put only eight cookies on each of these because there is a fair amount of spread and as I said I have a one ounce by volume Disher which is wrong that's one ounce by volume this is heavier I'm just now remembering when I wrote this recipe so I'm gonna switch that out yeah this will be better this is a one and a half tablespoon which should be about an ounce by weight let's see if that works out so all I'm gonna do is dose these out try to get the spacing right one two I know it doesn't look like a lot but these things do spread and I want to give them room to do so see if I've got this dosed properly let's just fast-forward through this part Wow well that pretty much worked out I'll lick this out when you're not watching okay now time to give these cookies their distinctive look and for that we need a fork let's see I've got a few choices here the tine marks are gonna matter so you know what I think I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with this one because it has narrower tines with a little more space make a nicer texture on the the cookie so I'm just gonna start over here and mash down and then kind of swipe like that I'm gonna do them all in one direction and then I'll come back and do them in the other direction now I don't mind them being a little on the rustic side if you want yours to be perfectly smooth then you could take the balls and make them all perfect and pretty before you mash the cookies I don't really care about that kind of thing so I'm not going to I like mine to look a little sloppy now notice I'm not just picking up the fork that would make a mess I'm kind of sliding it all right you shouldn't need to use any flour or anything like this like that if you do this properly I know some folks like to bake on those silicone mats are so Pat's as we call them I don't like this for these cookies I think they spread to much so go with parchment paper which it's not the same as wax paper don't use the wax paper that'll be like making crayons that's very different okay now I'm going the other way with the fork to make the famous crosshatch peanut butter cookie pattern that has been famous for pretty much ever ultimately you're looking for a diameter of uh I'd say that one's just about perfect so it's about just at two and a half inches across metal ruler in the kitchen very very valuable because especially if like somebody reaches for a cookie when it's not ready yet again not picking up sliding all right into the 350 degree oven I want to shoot for the middle of the box these will not fit - to Iraq so I'm gonna put one on the top middle and one on the lower middle if that makes any sense the middle as quickly as possible so we don't let any heat out any more than we need to and I'm going to set my timer for a mere 10 minutes that's all it's gonna take okay sliding them off the pan that early might be a mistake I think I'll let these cool for a second on the rack before I slide them off those are those are gonna go to the bad children simply allow the cookies to cool on the parchment on top of cooling racks for efficiency for about 10 minutes before devouring Wow that's a darn fine cookie and it doesn't have any gluten in it and it's got almost no ingredients in it and you've probably already got this stuff already in the pantry I'll just save this for later as for all of these let's just say now I can control all the children not coughing [Music]", "W_VNDXq2vA0": "in the Lizzie tea kitchen today we're making homemade peanut butter cookies these are a great make-ahead cookie they freeze really well they store well at room temperature for several days and they stay thought let me show you how easy these are to make I like to use my stand mixer when I mix up cookies just because it helps really get all that butter and sugar mixed together and all of those ingredients incorporated so that the cookies turn out beautifully every time so to my stand mixer I will add one cup of room temperature butter you want this butter to be soft but not melted then I'll add one cup of creamy peanut butter you can use chunky if you'd like it will just give a little bit of crunch to your cookies but my family likes creamy then I'll add one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar then I'll put the beater blade on the mixer and set it to stir and mix until that butter and sugar and peanut butter is nice and combined after all of those ingredients are mixed we will lift the stand mixer and then add in one teaspoon of vanilla and then we'll add in three eggs I like to beat the cookie batter after each egg addition so I put one in then set it to go let that mix in just a little bit and then add in a second egg and then you're laughing in a separate bowl all mixed together my dry ingredients I have four cups of all-purpose flour in this bowl I'll add in two teaspoons of baking soda in 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt then I'll just take a fork and mix that together a little bit you can use a whisk also then I'll lift this up and just add about half of the flour mixture in and mix it on low speed first so that flour doesn't go flying everywhere and then as that mixes in I'll just add the rest I like to stop it partway through and just make sure that the sides are scraped and all of the ingredients are getting incorporated and then mix one last time as it mixes so we'll kind of clean up the side of the bowl and that's how I can tell all of the ingredients are nice and incorporated in there turn off your mixer scrape that dough into the bowl and then it's time to scoop the cookies I have a big baking sheet here with a nonstick silicone mat we love using these mats just so cookies coming off the pan perfectly we like to use a cookie scoop just so that the cookies are all uniform and size you can make the cookies as big as you'd like just remember that the bigger they are the longer they will take to bake in the oven after you've scooped the cookies just take one of the dough balls and roll it between your hands just to make them nice and smooth peanut butter cookies have that classic crisscross pattern so to do that you take a fork and you just press crosses into the top of the cookie press down gently don't press too hard you want the cookies to be nice and thick to give the cookies just a little bit of an extra sparkle and sweetness I like to take some granulated sugar and just sprinkle the top slightly with sugar before baking this is totally optional it just gives a little sugary crunch on top I have the oven preheated to 375 degrees the cookies will bake about 9 to 10 minutes based on the size that you make the cookies if you like soft cookies make sure you do not overbake them so you may want to check them in about 9 minutes and see if they're done yet after the peanut butter cookies come out of the oven allow them to cool on the cookie sheet for about three to four minutes they are gonna be really soft and that will just help them set a little bit then move them to a wire rack to cool completely these peanut butter cookies are a great make-ahead recipe they store well at room temperature plus they freeze really well thanks for watching today i'm julie from taste of lizzy tea I hope your family loves these cookies [Music]", "hCbgs8zHYHs": "- If you think peanut butter and chocolate are a match made in heaven, then my crunchy, creamy\nno-bake peanut butter bars are for you. And if you like this video, don't forget to hit that\nlike button and subscribe. Hey, you're watching \"Preppy Kitchen,\" where I, John Kanell, teach you how to make\ndelicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. These no-bake peanut butter bars will be ready before you know it. So let's get started. First off, get a baking dish for this no-bake treat and line it with parchment paper or foil. Four snips at the corners\nis all you need to do. Fold it. You could use an eight by eight or a nine by nine inch square dish. It's really up to you, though. It's just gonna be how thick\nyour peanut butter bars are. Now after it's been cut and folded, it should just kind of gracefully plop in with a little bit of help. Your dish is ready to go. Everything will come out in a snap and there'll be no cleanup. It's perfect. Get a large bowl out and we're gonna place one\ncup of butter in there. I'm using unsalted because my\npeanut butter has salt added, but it's kind of to taste. So it's however you want. Cutting it into pieces so it melts easily and this is gonna go into\nthe microwave in bursts of like 30 seconds until\neverything is nice and melty. Cutting your butter makes it melt faster but it also helps prevent\nthe dreaded butter explosion in the microwave, which I have had happen\nto me way too many times. Okay. 30 second bursts until it's all melted. We'll be right back. Once your butter is melted, set it aside for just a bit and then we need to\ncrush some crackers up. I'm using graham crackers today but you could use any cookie\nthat you enjoy as well, like speculoos cookies, AKA Biscoff, shortbread, everything will work. But graham crackers are a classic choice. You know what? Easiest way is just to\nplace this on your counter and crush, crush, crush. (crackers crunching) This is fun. By the way, you can buy pre-crushed graham crackers, but I actually like the\nbigger pieces in this. There's something so amazing\nabout creamy peanut butter with crunchy crackers\nand the chocolate inside. It's a really delicious treat. We want about two cups\nof crushed crackers. If you're weighing it out, that's 240 grams. I had some extra saved over from before. I should've crushed this on the paper. That would've been so much easier. Oh, oh, well. I have my butter melted, my crackers crushed, and it's time to add the peanut butter. I want one cup. It's easiest to weigh it out though, because you know, transferring it to a cup, then transferring it to a bowl. That's too many dishes. You'll want 300 grams or so. All these measurements are you know, it's give or take. Any way you cut it, this is gonna be delicious. So you can have a little bit less, a little bit more. You could do things like\nuse crunchy peanut butter or creamy. It's whatever you'd like. Oh. I'm gonna set my scale\naside for just a little bit and now we're gonna cream this up until it's nice and smooth. You don't want any pockets of\npure butter hanging around. So just get a nice, smooth consistency. Nice and like, buttery peanut butter. This actually reminds\nme of my favorite snack. I liked toast with butter and\npeanut butter on top of that. It is (blowing kisses) delicious treat. I should've been monitored in\nthe kitchen a little bit more. Now it's time to add\nin the powdered sugar. I want 210 grams. That's one and three quarters of a cup. I think that makes these perfectly sweet. You want powdered sugar because it's gonna be\nreally, really creamy. That matches well with the crunchy. You don't want granulated\nsugar that's gonna crunch on your teeth in all the wrong ways. Scale's done. Now mix this up one more time\nuntil it is nice and smooth. And work on getting any clumps\nof powdered sugar broken up. (mixer whirring) Okay. Clean those beaters off. Before I add my crumbs in, I'm gonna just scrape the\nbowl down a little bit. There might be a bit of\npowdered sugar or butter here and there that we want to just mix in. One cup. Two cups exactly. That's amazing. I didn't measure it out before. Fold this in. The reason we're not mixing it is just because we wanna maintain\nthose larger cracker pieces. There's really no watery liquid in here. So even if you refrigerate\nthese for a couple days, the peanut butter bars\nare still gonna have that crunchy, creamy, delicious texture. It really adds a lot to them. If you wanna be fancy, you could add a teaspoon of vanilla. You could add any flavors you'd like. Maybe a touch of cinnamon. It's really up to you. As is, this is basically amazing. Get your square dish out again and we're going to just\ntransfer the mixture into this and smooth it out. I'm having to restrain myself and not just put this\ndirectly into my mouth. Just smooth it out right now to the edges. It definitely does not have to be perfect. We're gonna cover this all with\nchocolate in just a moment. After you're done smoothing, you can let this hang\nout in the refrigerator while we make our chocolate topping, just to get it started on the chill. To top off our peanut butter bars, we're adding in one and a half\ncups of semi-sweet chocolate. In you go. And you could use a little bit less, like down to one cup if you want a thinner layer of chocolate. You could also use milk or bittersweet. It's really up to you. I'm also adding in the magical ingredient, which is a quarter cup or\n65 grams of peanut butter. This is gonna go into the microwave in 30 to 40 second bursts and you want it to be almost all melted. The residual heat will\ncomplete the melting process. Also, stir after each burst. In you go. Few bursts in the microwave and you can see there are\na couple of lumps here, but all you have to do\nis just stir, stir, stir. It's pretty hot, so any little bits of chocolate will melt and be silky smooth. I can't tell you how amazing chocolate and peanut butter melted together are. They are the best. So as you can see here, this is perfectly smooth. It's ready to spread. So let's get that peanut butter\nbar back out of the fridge. Okay, let's pour this melted\nchocolate over the top. Oh my gosh. Melty, delicious, amazing. I'm smoothing this out with my spatula and just move it towards the ends. All right. So now just move that spatula back and forth and create a nice little wave. One more quick trip into the\nfridge and we'll cut them up. My peanut butter bars chilled for a little bit over an\nhour and they're totally set. That, by the way, is the magic of parchment paper. Fold your paper down and\nthen just cut them into bars that you enjoy eating. They could be small rectangles, squares, whatever you'd like.

We do a pretty good job here covering the\nclassics, like best ever chocolate chip cookie, best ever oatmeal raisin, and now best ever\npeanut butter cookie. As always the recipe can be found on my website\nBiggerBolderBaking.com and make sure you go over there after this video because I've got\na whole page dedicated to cookies. Okay, let's get started. So now into a small bowl I'm going to add\nin my flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. And then just give these ingredients a quick\nmix together. You'll know from watching Bigger Bolder Baking\nthat I always mix up my dry well before I add them to the rest of the ingredients just\nto make sure that everybody is like well combined. Okay lovely. Okay I'm gonna set that over to the side and\nwe're gonna get mixing the rest of our ingredients. So now in a separate large bowl, we're going\nto add in our room temperature butter, smooth peanut butter, yummy. White sugar, and brown sugar. And then with my electric mixer I'm gonna\ncream it together until it's really lovely and smooth. Now you can do this step by hand but you're\njust gonna need a lot of elbow grease so more power to you if you do. Just a little note about the peanut butter\nin this recipe, you don't have to use like an all-natural one sometimes the cheaper version\nactually works better in these cookies so just note that. So here's another great tip, you're butter\ndoes have to be at room temperature actually for a lot of cookie making, so what I do is\nI leave it out on the counter overnight and then the next morning it is perfect temperature\nfor beating up. Okay lovely so this is nice and fluffy it's\nbeen around 3-4 minutes, now into this I'm going to add in my egg, and a little bit of\nvanilla extract. And then go in with my beaters and combine\nthem. So now if you don't eat eggs, don't worry\nyou can still make this cookie, you can always add in a flax egg or a chia egg and all that\ninformation is on my website. Gorgeous, okie-dokie. Now last but not least we're going to add\nback in our dry ingredients. Then just give it a quick mix until your dough\ncomes together. At this stage if you're noticing that your\ncookie dough is a little bit crumbly it's because your butter needed to be even softer\nthan it was that's why those steps are really important but as you can see here this is\na nice sticky cookie dough. Our flour is mixed in, lovely. I love these kinds of recipes because it's\nkind of instant gratification it takes you no time to make your dough, we're gonna scoop\nthem and get them into the oven. Okay so I got my peanut butter cookie station\ngoing on over here, I've got my baking tray lined with parchment, I've got a little bowl\nof white sugar and I've got my cookie dough. Now I'm gonna scoop this gonna scoop this\ncookie dough straight away however you can put it into the fridge and let it chill for\nup to 3 days. So all you want to do is get a tablespoon,\nshape it in your hand, into your sugar, give it a roly-poly, and then onto your baking\ntray. And then do that with the rest of your cookie\ndough. So we want to make these look like quintessential\npeanut butter cookies so I have my fork and all you do is just do a criss-cross on the\ntop of the cookie. Just do a criss-cross on the top and this\nwill just look really lovely once your cookies are baked. Gorgeous! That's it we're all done these guys are ready\nto be baked off. Bake your cookies off at 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C for\nroughly 14-16 minutes, you don't want to go too much longer than that because you want\nthem to be chewy in the middle and not too brown on the outside. So this recipe will make around 30-32 cookies\nhowever when it comes to baking cookies I like to bake off one sheet at a time, I just\nfeel that you get the best results from your oven if you just do one sheet at a time. So I told you I've got a page on my website\ndedicated to cookies, but did you know you can actually upload your own photos to my\nwebsite of all the bold baking desserts that you make, I have got thousands of them up\nthere, I love to see them so if you make something definitely submit a photo. Our timer's gone off so let's check on our\ncookies. These guys look perfect, just like I said\nthey're not too brown around the edges as you can see and then I can tell that they're\nstill kind of soft in the middle. These cookies tend to be kind of soft chewy\nin the middle and that's exactly what we're going for here. These look lovely I'm gonna let them cool\ndown for 5 minutes before I break one open. I'm gonna put my cookies on a cooling rack\nso they can cool down completely. Now while it's still warm. I love these cookies. Kevin loves these cookies because this is\nsomething he grew up on, I've been living in the United States now almost 11 years and\npeanut butter is starting to become one of my most favorite ingredients I absolutely\nlove it. In these cookies you've got salty, sweet,\nyou've got really nice texture they're thick and a little bit chewy in the middle. These cookies are definitely something write\nhome about. Head over to my website now for the printed\nrecipe and upload your lovely photos of the peanut butter cookies. I'll see you back here really soon for more\nBigger Bolder Baking.", "2iGXjOb8hIs": "today's recipe is a six ingredient cookie peanut butter cookie one of my all-time favorites I remember when I was in high school they served peanut butter cookie and pizza on Fridays in the cafeteria it wasn't really a eat lunch at the cafeteria kind of person but I always got it on Fridays because of the peanut butter cookies and this cookie kind of reminds me of those okay so there's that it's a one and a half cups of flour and to that add one teaspoon of baking powder there's no additional salt to this recipe because the peanut butter that I'm using is salted so it's going to have plenty of seasoning without adding additional salt one stick of room temperature unsalted butter and one cup of light brown sugar that gives it that nice sort of denseness I guess all right this is the thing that I always turn it on I like to just start it off just a little bit so that is morning sorry one cup of brown sugar or one stick of butter this is one and a half cups of crunchy peanut butter don't get the unsalted or your cookies will be a little bland I think okay and one large egg you can just add those in now once you've started eating and mix Ragan my test picture - I work with always uses a hair mixer and I always use the standing mixer he just loves I was like I don't want to work just kidding now just beating your flower and the cookies done five minute cookie right okay I'm doing it eat in your flower so you want to beat it until it combines I feel like this getting caught in the beaters so I'm going to finish stirring it together by this it's a very dense dough full of delicious peanut butter I would say it's like I mean it is half peanut butter it was one and a half cups of peanut butter and 1/2 cups of flour which by weight I bet is more than half peanut butter if you're counting my ovens at 350 degrees getting ready to bake these guys off this is a parchment lined baking sheet take about a tablespoon at a time roll it into a ball you should go about three across the classic peanut butter cookie shape you're going to use the tines of a fork to press the cookie into a crosshatch shape and then you're gonna get these cookies into the oven to bake until they're set and just turning a little bit darker around the edges at 18 to 20 minutes these peanut butter cookies are a super simple and very nostalgic treat from me [Music]", "8taNGUeNhnY": "now it's time for the ultimate in drop cookie desserts I'm turning peanut butter cookies into warm peanut butter cookie cakes and these have a gooey caramel Center to them it starts with making the caramel sauce this is a butter caramel so it's a thicker style of caramel sauce I've got my heat set on high right off the top in my pot I'll pour in about three tablespoons of water this way when I add my one cup of sugar it immediately starts melting with the water and I'll pour in about a tablespoon of corn syrup and you don't want to stir now that you've got heat coming in contact with the sugar and it'll take about five to seven minutes for the sugar to turn a nice amber color and there we go I have a lovely amber tone now measure 1/4 cup of whipping cream to cool down the caramel so it doesn't caramelize too much further watch out for the steam and once that is stirred in have ready 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter oh look at that beautiful rich color I'll cool it down to room temperature and then show it you want to work with the caramel sauce while it's chilled it'll set up firmly while that's cooling down I can make the peanut butter cookie cake dough it starts with 1/2 a cup of soft unsalted butter and half a cup of regular granulated sugar and half a cup of light brown sugar just as if I were making peanut butter cookies I'll cream the butter and sugar together now that I've got the butter and sugar properly creamed I need 2/3 of a cup of peanut butter I like to use creamy peanut butter stir that in now I need 2 eggs just like when making traditional drop cookie dough you want your eggs at room temperature I'll mix them in one at a time with the second egg I'll add a teaspoon of vanilla now for the dry ingredients a cup of all-purpose flour and then add a full teaspoon of baking powder is a common ingredient found in cakes and it's really gonna help the cookie dough rise up and bake over the caramel Center in addition to that I need a quarter teaspoon of baking soda as well and lastly a quarter teaspoon of salt sift this through and just as if I were making a batch of peanut butter cookies stir this until blended there we go looks just like cookie dough because these are individual desserts I have six ramekins each has been greased with the inside coated with sugar this allows the dessert to turn out easily but also develops a nice crust on the outside I'm going to use a simple piping bag without a tip at all using a piping bag allows you to get the cookie batter into the cups are easier snip the end off of the piping bag and pipe a layer at the bottom of each of the ramekins and then a little ring around the sides leaving a nice little space for the chilled air melted oh I'm saving a little bit of the cookie dough to cover the caramel once it goes inside the ramekin now I've got a batch of the butter caramel that is fully chilled down and when you dig into it you can really get a sense how it's set up right nice and stretchy and I just drop a bit right in the center of the cake is buttered caramel is easy to manage cold but believe me it turns gooey when it's warmed up this is the kind of caramel I would make if I were making caramel candies and then dipping them in chocolate now with the remaining cookie dough I'll pipe right over to completely cover that caramel Center don't worry if the cookie cakes don't look precise and polished at this point just like a drop cookie the dough itself will melt and spread and fill the ramekin evenly there we go if you were to bake them now the caramel would actually drop and sink to the bottom of the cookie cake itself what you need to do is freeze them until they're firm it takes two to three hours to do this then to bake them they go right from the freezer into the other pre-heat your oven to 400 degrees takes about 20 minutes for them to cook you'll see that they start turning golden-brown and when they start doming up then it's time to pull them from the oven can smell the peanut butter and you can tell even by the tops it looks just like a peanut butter cookie got the nice golden brown cap and while it's crunchy on the outside you know it's gonna be soft and cakey in the center make sure you hold it with a tea towel and using an offset spatula just run it loosely around and I'll bring the plate up to its and then turn it over and reveal what looks like an innocent little warm nondescript cake except when you cut into it look at that caramel running out but you just want to dive into it [Music]", "lgMIPQ836tM": "[Music] Allrecipes member meshell gives us this recipe for oatmeal peanut butter cookies and notes a nice change of pace from the usual peanut butter cookie my husband never liked peanut butter cookies until I made him this recipe to begin preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit then into a mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer add half a cup of shortening half a cup of softened margarine a cup of packed brown sugar [Music] three quarters of a cup of white sugar and a cup of peanut butter you can use creamy or chunky for a little extra crunch cream this together until it's smooth then feed in two eggs one at a time until they're well blended in a separate bowl with one and a half cups of flour add two teaspoons of baking soda [Music] and a teaspoon of salt combine them and then stir the flour into the creamed peanut butter mixture [Music] next mix in one cup of quick cooking oats until they're just combined for a special touch you can also add a cup of chocolate chips peanut butter chips or white chocolate chips if you like drop the batter by T spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets bake the cookies and batches in the preheated oven until they're just like brown between 10 to 15 minutes careful not to over bake them rotate the cookies halfway through for more even baking cool the cookies on a rack you can store them in an airtight container Allrecipes member Jennifer raves about these oatmeal peanut butter cookies absolutely incredible I substituted one cup of butter instead of the margarine and shortening and it made the perfect cookie [Music]", "Ugyt2k2lPr0": "hi I'm Holly Clegg welcome back to my trim and terrific kitchen I have the most wonderful peanut butter cookie for you today it's diabetic friendly gluten free to weight watchers points and probably the best peanut butter cookie you will ever eat in fact most people that try this recipe never make any other recipe but this so I think it'll be your favorite peanut butter cookie as well so I'm a strong with a little trick here's our ingredients but you know one of the things about making anything with peanut butter or honey it's always sticks it's hard to get out so you want to spray your measuring cup with a little nonstick cooking spray and then we're going to put our peanut butter in calls for a cup okay and now watch how easy it comes out slides right out done stick that's my tip for you today okay then we need a little light brown sugar just gonna mix it all together you don't even need a mixer a half a teaspoon baking soda but make sure your baking soda is fresh that's important and one egg you're right I've had people ask me why didn't see flour in the recipe no flour in the recipe and it comes out perfect every single time and then we've mixed it together and we're gonna add a few chopped peanuts not a lot but just enough to give it that texture and crunchy flavor all right so then we're gonna make them into little balls here and here's another little tip for you can take a floured fork and you know you when you go to the bakery you get those ridges on your peanut butter cookies well this is how you do it slide it and if it message doesn't in fact probably should have done my that's why it's important to do your fork every time okay that's it sometimes when I have a chocolate sweet tooth I even put chocolate chips in it you want to bake it at 350 for about 10 to 12 minutes watch it and you have the best peanut butter cookie you're ever gonna have now I have a sweet tooth and I have to admit I eat cookies every single night and you know what I do I'm gonna eat one of these right now but guess what these came from my freezer I keep a bag of homemade peanutbutter cookies or my oatmeal cookies or whatever in my freezer because cookies freeze well and nothing is better than homemade cookies my peanut butter cookie will be your favorite recipe it's definitely mine peanut

they look like we start with a peanut butter cookie and then we're going to put a little miniature peanut butter cup on top really cute and they taste great so the first thing you will need to do is to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and this recipe you know depending on the site we're going to bake them in like these miniature muffin pans so for me I find about 45 cookies is what this makes but I'm only going to bake one I only have one pan so I'm going to make 24 and then I'll bake the rest off so um you can butter the your muffin cups or or oil them really or I'm just going to use one of these nonstick sprays makes it really easy now when you use especially with a muffin pan you tend to get some overspray on the top of your pants what I like to do is just take a paper towel or a cloth of some type and wipe that off because otherwise I find you know it can bake on which we don't want to wreck our pan let's solve the problem so now if you have an electric stand mixer like I have here use your paddle attachment you could use the hand mixer or really you could just large bowl wooden spoon spine - so first thing is a half a cup 113 grams of butter I'm using unsalted you could use salted here and have your butter at room temperature and then I'm just going to beat it just to get it nice and smooth it looks good so next you will need 1/2 a cup which is but 100 grams of firmly packed light brown sugar and 1/3 of a cup 65 grams of granulated white sugar and then I'm going to add one teaspoon four grams of pure vanilla extract and I'm just going to beat this medium high speed just to get everything mixed together and a little bit of air into the batter okay so there we have it we just got everything all mixed together a little bit of air so now we're going to add some peanut butter because we are making peanut butter cookies and you will need three quarters of a cup so that would be a hundred and eighty milliliters or if you want to go by gram weight that's 185 grams I'm using a creamy peanut butter the smooth I guess your smooth or smooth and then there's crunchy either one you can use my personal preference is the smooth and I'm just going to keep that in and as always you know scrape down the sides and the bottom of your bowl as much as you need to make sure that everything gets mixed a bit together so what you don't want is like clumps of Earth but lots of butter on the bottom of your paint of your bowl so now I'm going to add one large egg and have your egg at room temperature mixes in much easier and better if you put at room temperature oh pretty simple so now what I have in a separate Bowl is one and a half cups which is 195 grams of all-purpose flour you may know that as plain flour to that I'm going to add a half a teaspoon two grams of baking soda and 1/2 a teaspoon two grams of salt now if you use salted butter I would probably just leave out this salt so just whisk it in or stir it in so you want to make sure that the baking soda and the salt is really mixed into that flour and then I'm going to add that and we will be done now start your mixer on low speed because you don't want that flour coming up into your face okay so really not difficult I said you could even make this by hand and if you have a little flour on the sides of your bowl like I do just exit in and now we're going to put use about a tablespoon of batter for each cookie now if you want to go by weight and just weigh each one out that would be about 20 grams per cookie or so you can use just a tablespoon or I'm using a ice cream scoop that is a tablespoon and then important thing is to put about the same amount of batter in each muffin cup so that they all bake in the same length of time Hey and so what I do I'm using the ice cream scoop is I just gently flatten it and so there you have it now just as a little side note if you didn't have a miniature muffin pan you really could just bake these on a baking sheet just form them into little rounds like this same thing it's just the muffin pan keeps them into the nice shape so now um we are not adding the peanut butter cups yet so we are going to bake these off and then while they're still hot we're going to put a insert a little miniature peanut butter cup into each one so well while our cookies are baking because when you buy them they have the wrappers you're going to have to unwrap them and that's what I do while they're baking is take this up now if you wanted to you to mate to use homemade peanut butter cups you could go to the joy baking website and I do have a recipe to make your own peanut butter cups so you can do it that way so what we're going to do bake these now I find everyone's ovens a little different somewhere between nine and say 11 minutes somewhere in there so what you're looking for is the outside of the cookie will be set you're starting to get a little bit of color but you want the inside the centers of the cookies to still be soft because we wanted soft enough so that we can put the peanut butter cup in there and it just sinks right in so about nine to eleven minutes so our peanut butter cookies are done so put your pan on a wire rack and as you can see they're just starting to brown around the outside but the center's are still quite soft so now as soon as they come out of the oven what we're going to do is take our little peanut butter cup and just kind of gently just press it down a little into the center of each of your cookies and that's all you do I think they look too cool and they taste good that's all you do now once you do this you really I know it's going to be hard but you have to resist the urge to eat one because what you need to do is to let them sit so that the that the cookie the cookie firms up cools down and then firms up and that the and the same thing for the peanut butter cup because pushing it into a hot cooking it melts a little so that we wanted to firm up and then just to show you so this could take I would leave them like this for like maybe an hour maybe two hours you really want them to firm up so I'm going to try one that I made earlier so there we have it oh really good so you have this really soft and sweet and little chewy peanut butter cookie and then we have another kind of a double dose of peanut butter so you have the peanut butter cup and then peanut butter and chocolate perfect combo so these are really good so and you can store them room-temperature sometimes I like to put a few in the fridge because a really good cold or you can freeze them so try these and until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm", "87LIadtg8bM": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm\nshowing you how to make Peanut Butter Kiss

We're\ngonna scrape our peanut butter into the bowl and it helps when measuring peanut\nbutter if you spray the measuring cup with nonstick cooking spray so it comes\nout a little bit easier Then we'll add in the 1/2 cup of brown sugar and the\n1/2 cup of white granulated sugar and we'll cream this together. You want to\nmix it for a good two to three minutes until it's nice and creamy Then we'll\nadd in our egg, our 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and then we'll mix this in until\nit's just combined. It should end up thick enough that you can form it into a\nlittle dough ball. Then grab a tablespoon or just a regular spoon and we'll\ngrab a heaping tablespoon of our dough and we'll roll that into little 1 and a\nquarter inch balls and then place it onto our prepared baking sheet/ Keep on\nrolling out your cookies. I like to put 12 to a pan. Because they're so small\nit's tempting to add more to the pan but they really need all of this space\naround them. This recipe makes 24 cookies so you'll need to make up two pans. Bake\nthese one at a time in a 350 degree oven for about 8 minutes. Now while the cookies\nare baking you'll need to unwrap your Hershey Kisses so that they'll be ready\nto place this on the cookies. Now as soon as your cookies come out of the oven\nyou'll want to grab them and while they're still hot fresh out of the oven\nyou'll press a Hershey kiss into the top of each one. They almost look wrong\nthe way that they are but trust me they're done. The Hershey kiss going in\ncauses that wonderful crinkle effect and slightly melts the Hershey kiss Let\nthese cool completely on the pan before you try and remove them and eat them. Now\nif you wanted to make these cookies without the Hershey kiss on top they\nwouldn't be quite right. What you want to do is actually press\nthem down with a fork before baking so you end up with a nice little circular\ncookie. Oh it's so tempting to just grab one of these but they'll fall apart\nunless you cool them completely. I guess I'll just pop a Hershey kiss in to hold\nme over. Thanks for watching!

so delicious and they've been really really popular so I thought I'd share the recipe with you come on let's go fight so let's get started so the first thing I'm going to need to do is to beat some butter and some peanut butter together I have 120 grams of smooth peanut butter this isn't the kind of whole nut stuff this is the naughty stuff which works better in these cookies and then I also have 110 grams of softened unsalted butter and I'm going to just put that in and feet' them together until they're nice and fluffy all right so now that is looking really lovely and silky I'm going to add two different kinds of sugars so I've got a hundred grams of light soft brown sugar here and hundred grams of caster sugar I'm just going to put them in and beat them for about three minutes already looking yummy but yearning for more stuff so I've got one large free-range egg here it's going to pop that in as well and also I'm going to add half a teaspoon of good vanilla extract and I'm just going to beat those together until it's all really smooth and now it's time to add some flour so I have 150 grams of plain flour and half a teaspoon of bicarbonate soda and these recife mix together for about 30 seconds I'm quite a low speed just until it all comes together so now that's all come together I'm going to add the last thing which is 75 grams of chocolate chips I'm using dark chocolate chips here and I'm just going to fold those in as well and that is my peanut butter cookie dough done and all I need to do now is to refrigerate it for about half an hour I don't want it refrigerated for too long because I don't want to be too hard when I scoop it so I'm just going to transfer all of that into a bowl and then put that in the fridge so my batter has been in the fridge for about half an hour and it's nice and cool and it's not too stiff so I'm going to scoop it with teaspoons because I don't need very much because they spread out quite a lot so I'm going to scoop out about this much and then you need to be spaced quite far apart because like I said they spread out quite a lot so I'm starting this corner and work my way all over the sheet okay so I've used about half of my batter and I've got quite a lot of cookie so I'm going to put this to one side and you can refrigerate this for a few days or you can even put it in the freezer and then chop out your cookies at a later stage but I know what you're thinking these roads are looking very smooth and not all Rocky so I'm going to fix that so what I've got here are some peanuts some chocolate chips and some marshmallows and I'm going to build up on top of these mitten all baki I find the best amount of rockiness comes with five marshmallows that what I do is I just stick them into the top and then in between all of them I'll put a couple of chocolate chips and then in between those a bit of peanut action so I'm just going to carry on until all my cookies are rock eroded and now I just need to bake these at 170 degrees C for 10 to 12 minutes there'll be a little bit soft and gooey inside but that is perfect my cookies are cooling down they're not quite cool completely which is great because they're really super nice and they're warm but I have one last thing to do and that is to drizzle some chocolate so I have some melted chocolate here I've just used milk chocolate you can use whatever chocolate you like and I've got it in a piping bag and snip the end off and give it a good old riddle and there all done and there they are my delicious peanut butter rocky road whew it's crispy on the outside it's gooey in the middle and all those melty marshmallows are all like gummy and stringy and this is one of the tastiest cookies I've ever made so Navigo hmm I was delicious probably got chocolate in my face now well anyway I hope you've enjoyed this video thanks so much for watching if you have enjoyed it give it a thumbs up below and I will be back next week with another recipe and

whenever you measure brown sugar make sure that you pack it into your little measuring cup so that you get an accurate reading and then all of our peanut butter okay that's good I'm gonna drop this down speed number one and just start mixing all this together but if you don't have a stand mixer you can use a hand electric mixer as well that's good lift this up I'll get my first egg in just get

And the best thing is, these are all ingredients\nthat you have in your house right now! Now because this is Bigger Bolder Baking I\nam going to show you three different recipes where you can do just that. So lets get baking! So if you follow me on social media you\u2019ll\nknow that I'm always out and about in LA, traveling, or working. So I eat a lot of snacks on the go. Now, on Bigger Bolder Baking, I emphasize\nusing good quality ingredients, that\u2019s why I'm excited to tell you that I partnered with\nNatureBox who have the exact same ethos. NatureBox create unique snacks that taste\ngreat and they\u2019re better for you, they\u2019re made with good quality ingredients and they\nhave no artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners, which is one of the things I love about them. Now, my favorite snacks are Dark Cocoa Nom\nNoms - it\u2019s kind like a brownie and a truffle all mixed into one. It\u2019s so delicious. I also love Crunchy BBQ Twists, which are\nlentil chips. And another one is Santa Fe Corn Stix, I love\nthese because they\u2019re a little bit spicy. Now, they also make amazing jerky but I cant\nshow it to you \u2018cause I already ate it and I wasn\u2019t supposed to do that. But anyway. On their website, NatureBox.com, they have\nover 100 snacks over there and they add new ones every single month, so you\u2019ll never\nget bored. Now here is the best part: NatureBox have\nvery kindly offered my Bold Bakers three free snacks with your first order. All you have to do is go to NatureBox.com/Gemma. They will deliver them straight to your door,\nand if you don\u2019t like your snacks, they will replace it for free. Now, all of this information can be found\nin the description box below the video. Now, unfortunately for right now, this offer\nis only available to US residents. Okay, now lets get started on our recipes. So the first recipe were going to make, believe\nit is or not, is a three ingredient oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. It tastes so amazing. All you need are some rolled oats, some bananas,\nand then chocolate chips. So the first thing were gonna do is mash our\nbananas in a bowl with a fork. Mash up your banana until it\u2019s really fine\nand then there\u2019s no lumps. We wanna get it nice and mushy. Lovely. Ok now into this were going to add in rolled\noats and some chocolate chips. Now at this point you might be thinking to\nyourself, \u201cGemma\u2019s gone crazy!\u201d And there\u2019s no way these are gonna make\ncookies. Well, it does because the banana acts as your\negg and as your butter and it bakes just like it. And our oats are going to be similar to our\nflour. The best thing about these cookies is that\nit doesn\u2019t contain any gluten because oats don\u2019t have gluten. Also, there\u2019s no egg, and there\u2019s no added\nsugar so it\u2019s a really good cookie for you. And, made in less than five minutes. Now I'm gonna scoop this guy onto our tray. So I like to do a big scooped tablespoon of\ncookie mix and then straight onto your tray lined with parchment paper. Now, I love chocolate chip cookies but the\nthing about it is, you don\u2019t want chocolate chips, you can put raisins in there, even\nadd a little bit of cinnamon, whatever you like. Okay, that\u2019s it, our cookies are done, just\nso you know, these guys wont spread out too much so you want to give them a little pat\ndown and flatten out. I mean seriously, three ingredients, five-minute\ncookies, come on, nothing better than this. Okay, these guy are looking great, they\u2019re\nready to be baked off. Bake these little beauties off at 350 degrees\nFahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius for roughly 15-20 minutes. Our cookies are out of the oven they smell\nabsolutely delicious. Now, as you can see, these cookies actually\ndon\u2019t brown a whole lot, but that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s the nature of them. They just look like this on the outside and\nas they go cold they, they firm um a little bit. So they\u2019ve cooled down a little bit so I'm\ngonna crack one open. This looks delicious. Mmm. The crazy thing about these cookies is that\nthey\u2019re gluten free, they are egg free, they have no added fat, all natural sugars,\noh man, if you leave out these chocolate chips and add in dairy-free chocolate chips they\nalso make great vegan cookies. I have to say these cookies were a great success. Now, I hope you like coconut, \u2018cause that\nis our next recipe. So in our next three-ingredient recipe we\nare going to make coconut macaroons. You know those lovely mounds with the chocolate\non the bottom, I love them, and you can make them with just three ingredients: some shaved\ncoconut, or desiccated coconut, some condensed milk, and some chocolate. Just like the other cookie, whip it all together\nand bake it off. So into our bowl add in coconut, followed\nby our condensed milk, and then mix it all together with a spatula. So now this is another great cookie recipe\nthat doesn\u2019t require egg or flour. Really, really easy. So traditionally coconut macaroons have egg\nwhites in them, but the condensed milk in this recipe eliminates the need for that. Okay that it, I go back to what I said, five\nminute cookies in no time. These guys are ready to go onto our baking\ntray. To shape, scoop a nice heaped tablespoon of\nyour macaroon mix and then just place it on your tray, leaving a little bit of space between\nthem. Now, I know these are really easy recipe to\nremember, but the quantities and all the instructions can be found on my website, BiggerBolderBaking.com. Okay, we are done with another cookie. No time at all. These guys are ready to be baked off. Bake your coconut macaroons off at 350 degree\nFahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius, for roughly 15-20 minutes. So here are our coconut macaroons, can you\nbelieve how gorgeous they look? They're golden brown on top, they smell amazing,\nI just adore coconut so much. There's something about it that leaves me\nwanting more. These beautiful, I like how they kept as well. Now, traditionally these guys are served with\na little bit of chocolate on the bottom so now that they're nice and cooled, that's our\nnext step. So here I have a bowl of melted chocolate,\nand I've got myself some forks. I'm just gonna go ahead and dip the bottom\nof the macaroon into the chocolate. You just want to dip the bottom, you don't\nwant it to go too far up the sides. Just like so. And then scrape off any excess chocolate,\nand then put it onto your rack so it can dry off. And then go ahead and just keep on dipping. One of the biggest requests I get are recipes\nwithout eggs so I'm really glad that I'm able to bring you two cookies that have no eggs\nin them so that more people can enjoy them. Okay, our macaroons are looking fantastic,\nand I can tell that this guy over here is dry, so I can give him a taste. Oh yum. Yum, yum, yum. I just love coconut, so tasty. It's nice and thick, squishy, a little bit\nof sweetness from the condensed milk, mmm, mmm, mmm. I really, really love this one, but I think\nI might have actually saved the best to last. So I really hope you like peanut butter. So now, get this! I am going to show you how you can make the\nbest peanut butter cookie you've ever had with three simple ingredients. Peanut butter, sugar, and an egg. So into our bowl I'm gonna add in my peanut\nbutter. Now, you can use chunky or smooth peanut butter,\nalso, you can use any kind of a nut butter you like. That will work well too. Follow your peanut butter with some sugar,\nand then one egg. And then just combine all these together. So now like the other cookies, this cookies\ndoesn't contain flour, however it does contain an egg, and we cant substitute that out, we\nneed that in these cookies. Okay, there you go. Another cookie mixed under five minutes. Nice and soft. Now were gonna scoop him onto our baking tray. Just like the other cookies, I like to do\na heaped tablespoon of batter. Make \u2018em nice and big. Okay, so now they're all scooped. Now were gonna get that lovely traditional\nlook that you usually see on a peanut butter cookie. You need two forks, and all you want to do\nis just press one down on top, then go across it the other way. So just do a criss-cross. And then just keep on going all the way around. And press down your cookies a little bit so\nthey spread out more when they bake. So now I want you to hang around to see these\nonce they come out of the oven \u2018cause I'm telling you they're the best cookies ever. Okay, gorgeous! Made all pretty, good to go, time to bake\n\u2018em off! Bake your cookies at 350 Fahrenheit or 180\ndegrees Celsius for roughly 15-20 minutes. Here we are, out of the oven if you could\nonly smell my kitchen right now, oh it smells heavenly! Now, I love to eat peanut butter cookies warm,\nso I'm just gonna break this guy in half and just show you how delicious and buttery he\nis on the inside. It's not cakey \u2018cause it has no flour in\nit, its soft, absolutely delicious. Mmm, oh yeah. I mean, seriously, takes no time at all to\nmake.

Okay!", "GQsyErSoWP0": "hey guys it's rachel and today i will be talking about making three different kinds of peanut butter cookies if you guys know me at all i absolutely love peanut butter and i love all kinds of nut butters actually i just love nuts in general not weird it's not weird i really love nuts and i love nut butters in particular so today i will be comparing three different kinds of peanut butter cookies because that is one of my all-time favorite cookies and it includes peanut butter so where can you go wrong there i don't really think you can so i'm trying out three different recipes and each recipe has something that's a little bit unique about them since peanut butter cookies are so simple to make i thought it would be fun to choose elevated recipes or unique recipes that were just a touch different from your classic peanut butter cookies so the first cookie that i chose to make was actually a sandy and it's from new york times essentially it's a sweet and salty peanut butter sandy which isn't quite like a cookie because it has more of a shortbread and crumbly texture but it's really interesting because it's a little bit of salty a little bit of sweet these cookies actually came together really really quickly and really fast they are very efficient to make and you only need a few ingredients you don't even need baking powder or baking soda which is kind of crazy and i think another unique aspect of the sweet and salty cookie is that you toss it essentially in a combination of sugar and salt and you dust that all around your cookie before you bake it off which i've been used to baking off cookies you know dusted in sugar but with salt too that was a really unique addition the second peanut butter cookie that i made was also unique but for a different reason this one was unique because i used brown butter in order to make these cookies brown butter has actually become pretty popular i would say nowadays in terms of making cookies or even making brownies or other types of desserts browning the butter adds this level of nuttiness that you just don't really get if you use regular butter so these brown butter peanut butter cookies came together pretty quickly all you have to do that's different at the beginning is to brown your butter on a saucepan you also don't want to burn your brown butter which i have done before you just want to give it a nice caramelly color these cookies are a bit more classic they turned out a little bit more traditional you use baking powder and baking soda salt all that jazz so nothing too crazy here [Music] where the hell did all your friends go and the very last variation of peanut butter cookies that i made today was one that actually includes miso so instead of adding salt to my peanut butter cookies i added miso paste and using white miso paste is actually very salty so you don't need to add any additional salt to these cookies i have made these cookies before and i actually thought they were a little bit too salty so i think what really helped this time was like coating all of the cookie dough balls in a layer of deromer sugar or white sugar in order to just kind of balance out that saltiness because white miso paste can be pretty salty and these cookies come together pretty traditionally as well you'll just need brown sugar baking soda baking powder flour your egg vanilla extract and all of that as well [Music] is [Music] so i have all three cookies with me here today all three variations and i will be doing an aesthetic comparison as well as a taste test first up our new york times sweet and salty peanut butter sandies based off appearance alone they are actually kind of craggly and misshapen i didn't actually roll these cookie dough balls into formal balls i just scooped them out for my cookie dough scoop and plop them onto a baking sheet there was no instruction to actually make these you know nice beautiful balls but they kind of turned out a little misshapen and they're not the prettiest they are heavily sprinkled with sugar and salt which gives it a nice little crust and adds a little sparkle to the top of each of these cookies however i would say that they are the least aesthetic of the bunch now let's get into taste given how simple it was to make these cookies it is surprisingly flavorful and delicious i think that combo of salt and sugar at the top adds a lot to these cookies they almost kind of remind me of a buttery shortbread more than they do an actual cookie but they actually taste really delicious and they are super simple to make all right next up we have the brown butter peanut butter cookies these ones actually didn't flatten out that much so they're pretty round if you take a look at these cookies they have the most volume and height out of all the cookies that i made today they do have these nice cracks on the top however and they do smell pretty good you can tell that the brown butter is definitely in there i will say that when i was baking these cookies it was interesting because while i was preheating the oven the recipe said to go ahead and refrigerate the cookies which i thought would make the cookies hold its shape better and it did but a little bit too much all right so now i'm going to dive into the flavor dang these cookies are good so with these cookies the nuttiness of the brown butter comes through really strong it adds a level of complexity and flavor to these peanut butter cookies that i've never even tasted before i will say that the texture of these cookies is really crumbly and a little dry but it is actually really tasty and the flavor is spectacular all right so now we've got the miso cookies which is also recipe from new york times and i will say based on appearance these are the most aesthetically pleasing cookies they have a nice coating of sugar on the outside they have beautiful cracks and they flatten out just perfectly these look like the most traditional cookies and also the most beautiful cookies i would have to say now let's dive in and see if the miso paste makes a real difference with these cookies you really taste that miso i actually strangely really like the addition of miso it is a little bit on the saltier side perhaps a bit too misophy but i actually really like it if i were to make these cookies again i would maybe reduce the amount of miso paste just a touch but the chewiness and the texture of this cookie is really on point i think it's because it uses a lot of brown sugar so it's very chewy and very dense but it's packed with flavor and i will say that the crunch on the outside with the sugar that we rolled the cookies in adds a lot to these cookies so now it comes down to the ultimate decision which of these three peanut butter cookie variations is the actual best i think for me out of all three of these cookies they all have their pros and cons i will say that if you want an easy and fast cookie that comes together quickly i would recommend the sweet and salty peanut butter sandy from new york times that thing just came together so quickly and tasted so good if you want a type of cookie that's a little bit more unusual and has a flavor palette that isn't traditional i would go for the miso cookies because those are really unique and i don't think anyone's really ever tried peanut butter and miso together very often and if you want a traditional peanut butter cookie that has elevated flavor and richness then i would totally go for the brown butter peanut butter cookies so my personal favorite out of all these three and i have kind of a unique flavor palette and a unique taste but for me i think it would definitely be the peanut butter miso cookies those cookies have just an amazing texture and amazing crunch and really unique flavor that you don't get anywhere else i will say that a close runner up is the brown butter peanut butter cookie as well that nuttiness from that brown butter is amazing lastly i like convenience but for me it's not super important i will go the extra mile as you guys can see to really make the best peanut butter cookie out there although if i was in a rush or i had not that much time then i would totally go for the new york times sweet and salty peanut butter sandy so my ultimate winner for today has gotta be the new york times peanut butter and miso cookie i hope you guys enjoyed this video and i hope you learned something about making peanut butter cookies and the different types of variations you can play around with so definitely leave a comment down below if you guys try out any of these recipes i will leave the links to the recipes in the description box below and i hope you guys enjoyed this video until next time bye guys you", "zU6SnkNIdrw": "ever had a craving for cookies but just don't have a lot of ingredients in the cupboard chances are you've got all you need for this amazingly simple recipe let's make some three ingredient peanut butter cookies on the one pot chef three ingredient peanut butter cookies these couldn't be simpler anyone can make these into a mixing bowl we're gonna put in 1 cup of white sugar 1 egg and 1 cup of peanut butter whether you choose to use smooth or crunchy is entirely up to you I'm using smooth today then simply using a electric mixer we're just going to beat everything together until it's nice and smooth and combined and what we end up with is this wonderful thick cookie dough absolutely perfect there's no flour there's no baking powder there's nothing it's so so easy and so so basic to make our cookies simply take a teaspoon full of our cookie dough mixture and roll it in your hands to make a little ball and then simply place the ball on a baking tray lined with some non-stick baking paper and with a fork just gently press down like so and then move on with the rest I ended up making about 25 cookies out of this mixture which I've just divided between two trays and I'm ready put these into the oven preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about 10 minutes or until the cookies are nice and firm and golden once out of the oven leave the cookies on the tray for at least 5 minutes so they can firm up a little bit before transferring them carefully onto a wire rack to cool completely and then we'll be ready to eat crisp and golden with an amazing peanut butter flavor it's hard to believe that this is only three ingredients but I guess this proves that magic can't happen in the kitchen I cannot believe how amazing these smell I mean the whole kitchen smells like peanut butter so so cool so time to have a taste mm-hmm [Laughter] mmm crisp on the outside let's have a soft and slightly chewy on the inside it's sweet its salty it's peanut butter what more could you possibly ask for mmm these are so good and it's sticking to the roof of my mouth too I need a glass of milk oh I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot chef show calm and until next time see you later it is sheer willpower that I am not eating this entire plate of cookies because my god these are so tasty but that one kind of looks kind of broken so everyone knows that if you've got a broken cookie all the calories are fallen out so it's fat-free so make sense to me", "otlhLcuVi4c": "so you guys know I love making keto cookies

is gonna be some coconut oil I already went ahead and measured in melted mine and today we'll be using a tablespoon or 14 grams that stuff for our keto cookies so obviously today's keto cookie recipe is a peanut butter chocolate chip keto cookie recipe and my recommendation for peanut butter is to go with one that has no sugar added to it personally I like to use the Smuckers natural peanut butter but if you can't find that one just try to find one similar to it with that being said for the keto cookies today we're gonna be adding just less than a third of a cup or 70 grams of the peanut butter to our Bowl last but not least we're gonna add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and now at this point we're just gonna mix all those ingredients together until they're well combined once they're combined that's we're going to start adding our dry ingredients and the first dry ingredient we're gonna add is going to be some blanched almond flour and if you're trying to keep the carbs as low as possible I highly recommend going with the Kirkland's blanched almond flour because for every 28 gram serving it only has to net carbs and that's the lowest that I've seen anyways today we're gonna add a cup or a hundred 12 grams of that stuff to our bowl and then of course we want to add some sweetness to our keto cookies but we're gonna want to do that without adding any carbs and the best way to do that is by using some oral today I'm using the confectioner's ortho all by swarf it's carb free it's calorie free it works for it to sweeten up pretty much everything and today we'll be using three tablespoons or 42 grams of it to sweeten up our keto cookies we're also gonna add a half a teaspoon of baking soda along a quarter teaspoon of baking powder a pinch of salt and then of course we're gonna add our chocolate chips today I'm using the no sugar added Lily's chocolate chips if you've never tried these before they're amazing totally low-carb totally keto friendly highly recommend picking some of these up if you haven't already they're a game changer as far as chocolate chips go but with that being said for today's keto cookies we're gonna add just less than a quarter cup or 35 grams those to our bowl all right so now at this point we're gonna take a spatula and mix all those ingredients together until a thick batter starts to form once the batter forms we're gonna use our hands to form a ball of dough out of the batter and then at this point we're gonna set that bowl aside we're gonna get out a baking sheet or an align the baking sheet with parchment paper and then we're gonna coat the parchment paper with baking spray once you've done that we're gonna get our bowl full of cookie dough back out and at this point we're gonna take a cookie scoop and scoop out 12 equal size cookies from that ball of dough so when you got the cookie dough added to the baking sheet you want to flatten the cookie dough either with the bottom of the spoon or an icing knife and then once you flatten the cookie dough it's time to get these in the oven and you want to bake these at 325 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes they're gonna be a little soft when they come out of the oven almost cake like but don't worry at all about that because once they set they'll firm up and become much more cookie like so you want to let them cool completely in the tray itself and then check this out this is what these keto cookies end up looking like they're soft they're chewy they're full of peanut butter chocolate chip deliciousness and I hope you guys enjoy them as always for more information about today's recipe check the video description below and I'll see you in the next one", "fxxHNY20iLU": "hi I'm Jessica from the novice chef and today we're gonna make my chewy peanut butter cookies they are super easy and amazingly delicious we start with a little flour and then we're going to add some baking soda and then a little salt and we're going to whisk that all together set it aside we're gonna beat our butter and our sugars together so we've got a stick of butter nice and soft we've got our peanut butter and we have a lot of brown sugar and a little granulated sugar then we're gonna beat these to combine them I'm gonna beat it till it's nice and fluffy and then we're gonna add an egg and a little vanilla and we're gonna beat those again and then we're gonna add our flour now we're gonna scoop ours I like to use big cookie scoop I like to flatten the bottom you know just scrape it on the bowl and flatten the bottom so it has a nice flat bottom for the cookie now right before they go into the oven these cookies are really gonna spread and they're gonna get these little crackly tops so I like to take some granulated sugar and sprinkle it right on top and when they bake the sugar falls into the little cracks and it gives it kind of a little sparkle so now into the oven we go and here they are fresh out of the oven you see all the little sparkles from the sugar that we sprinkled on top it looks so good they smell even better be careful because they still are hot my girls are on their way home right now and they're gonna be so excited when they walk in and I'll smell them first that their cookies and that their favorite peanut butter cookies I'll win best mom award this week and these are my favorite peanut butter cookies and I'll show you why look how chewy they are oh they're perfect the edges are just baked just right to be a little firm and the inside is so soft and chewy oh they're so good I have to eat one where the kids get home at you know mall for this recipe and so many others visit the novice chef blog calm", "Ee5mNVAk0uE": "what's going on today guys we are making Nutter butters in my opinion not that great of a cookie some people seem to love it megha said that's her favorite cookie it's pretty lackluster overall can we agree on that it's not good if it's your favorite cookie you don't know cookies a lot of people get this confused with nutty bars Nutter butters are cookies that are peanut butter filled with more peanut butter just like a lot of peanut butter so we're making those today but it's gonna be a soft cookie and it's actually a really simple recipe just like a basic peanut butter cookie recipe what we're gonna start with is peanut butter and a lot of people have questions about what to look for with peanut butter honestly just look at the ingredients as long as it's only peanuts and maybe salt you're good ok so to start we need 1 cup of peanut butter we're using this creamy you could probably go now I would say don't go with chunky go creamy but comment below you guys chunky or you guys creamy people growing up I was diehard creamy but as I aged I was like there's something with chunky I get it now chunky is good meg is the perfect combination of creamy and chunky what would you say you're more creamy or chunky as a woman do that we're gonna sweeten it up a little bit these have to be sweet cookies we're gonna do 1/4 cup of powdered or erythritol and if you don't have powdered erythritol you can just pulse it in a food processor or a coffee grinder I'm just gonna eyeball it I'm an eyeball mode over here today and then we're gonna do 15 to 20 drops of stevia 3/4 of a teaspoon of vanilla extract the salt of desserts I'm like an old Italian grandma over here just eyeballing the recipe and then lastly one egg and this is really just like the most basic keto peanut butter cookie recipe right here so if you want to just make the cookies of course you can do that too and I'm going to mix this with a fork and we've got the oven preheating to 350 okay so you see how this came together really well look at the consistency if if you don't use the erythritol it maybe won't come together quite as well what you could try if you want to get crazy as maybe just like a splash of coconut flour so now I'm gonna take this I'm gonna roll these into 1-inch balls place them on a baking sheet and what you want to do is Pat them out so they're pretty thin you want these to be thin so you get more filling to cookie ratio they won't really spread in the oven Double Stuf Oreos exist for a reason we like the filling we don't really like the cookies as much unless we're talking to Oreo cake stirs now if we're talking Oreo cake stirs we like the cookies Oreo cases are the single best thing you can buy in like the cookie aisle at the grocery store I know cookies very well what yeah not even a cookie it's a cake sir it's a cake you want a crunch what's your favorite cookie you want a crunch are you kidding with a cookie you want a soft cookie those are pretty good but they're not I mean they're not Oreo cake stares but they make golden Oreo cake fingers okay I'm just gonna roll these out I'll show you right before I put them in the oven okay so we are done forming the Nutter Butter cookies and we're gonna put these in the oven for about 15 minutes or until they're golden brown well the cookies are in the oven we're gonna be making the filling to go inside the Nutter butters and it's going to be like a whipped cream peanut butter type of mixture so we're gonna start with 1/4 cup of heavy cream a little splash of vanilla extract about a quarter teaspoon a few drops of stevia just to sweeten it up and then we're gonna whip this up okay so we got the cream whipped up pretty nice to that we're just going to add a quarter cup of peanut butter this is what's going to give it the peanut butter flavor of course and it'll also make the mixture more substantial and thick I'm just gonna eyeball it there we go and give that just one quick mix to incorporate the peanut butter and there is your feeling now we just got to wait for the cookies and we'll be back to assemble we're back guys these have been cooked and they've cooled for like 15 minutes or so you definitely want to let them cool or the filling will melt and you can see they're actually like not I wouldn't call it soft Nutter Butter but it's definitely not as crunchy as a real Nutter Butter is but all that's left to do is fill these and then try them okay let's just make a few of these and give it a try so take your cookie grab some of this filling I feel like I'm in the Sandlot you take the graham you put the mallow on the graham just fill the Nutter Butter thin layer just a thin delicate layer find the top cookie there it is and if you know Nutter butters you know that that's about how much filling is in them they're not overly filled and now we just try it out of this world Wow overwhelming peanut buttery flavor you get the nice toastiness of a real homemade peanut butter cookie man you definitely have all the ingredients at home right they have all the ingredients yeah you pretty much have all these ingredients at home at all times I mean their cookies are good on their own it's a pretty basic recipe but the filling just takes it to another level you can even just like dip it in that's what I would probably do unless I was making this to take somewhere that's all there is to it guys this recipe is exceptional if you're a peanut butter lover we

from start to finish let's do this or this recipe all you need are three simple ingredients we have our organic natural peanut butter so none of that like sugar added salt all that stuff just get plain and simple it's delicious you don't need anything more um we have some coconut sugar here which is a low GI sugar but we're only using half a cup of this which is much better than most peanut butter cookies and then we have one organic egg and that's it we're going to mix all three of these together and we'll throw them in the oven so you're going to kick things off by adding the peanut butter to a large bowl you're going to want to try and get all the peanut butter but we all know that that never really happens plus you need a little bit to you know eat on the side then you're going to add your coconut sugar and then top that off with one large organic egg and yep you can mix everything in the same bowl which is really convenient so you'll just start mixing it and eventually it's going to come together into a large ball and that's it I've got my friend Lee from foodie finds here because of course if there's peanut butter she will be somewhere it's my favorite it's her favorite so she's going to help me actually put the cookies together and we're gonna throw them in the oven and we're gonna attempt to not eat all of them before we film the outro yeah alright at times okay so

Soft and Chewy Hello and welcome back to In the Kitchen with\nMatt, I am your host Matt Taylor. Today I am going to show you how to make peanut\nbutter cookies, mmm, yummy. This homemade peanut butter cookie is really\nis to do, if I can do it, you can do it, let's get baking. All right first we are going to preheat our\noven to 375 degrees. We have one cup or peanut butter, and what\nwe are going to do is take our butter, we have one half cup of softened butter, one\nhalf cup of light brown sugar, one half cup of white granulated sugar, and with a hand\nmixer or stand mixer, let\ufffds go ahead and cream this all together. Okay once we are done let\ufffds go ahead and\nscrape the sides. Okay, now we have 3 tablespoons of milk, let\ufffds\nadd that, start the, cream it together, scrape the sides, one egg, cream that in together,\n1 tsp. of vanilla extract. And then let's scrape the sides one more time,\nand then we take 1 and ? cups of all purpose flour, add one tsp. of baking powder, 1 fourth\ntsp. of salt. And then with a fork or a whisk or you can\nsift it together; let's mix this all together. All right, come back to our peanut butter,\nand then we are going to add this, about a third of a time, add the flour to the peanut\nbutter mixture. Let's turn on the mixer, scrape the sides,\nadd another third of the flour, okay, and then let's add the rest of the flour, and\nscrape the sides one more time. Okay once we are done mixing, let's go ahead\nand clean the beaters. As a kid, my favorite part of cookie making\nwas actually licking off the beaters, some how my mom always would clean off a ton, to\nwhere, like that, to where I would barely have any to lick off. And now our dough is ready to go. All right, now it is time to roll out our\ncookies. So what you do, I just take a table spoon,\nyou can use whatever method you want, this just helps to get the same amount of cookie,\nand just get some dough here, and then I am going to roll it into a ball like that, and\nthen you place it on a cookie sheet, and then what you are going to do is you are going\nto take a fork, and you are going to push it down \nlike that. And you can leave it like that shape, or you\ncan come in to this other side and go like that, all right, now, optionally what you\ncan do also, what I like to do, if you want extra sweet cookies, go ahead and take your\ndough and roll it into sugar, all around like that, pretty cool, go ahead and do the same\nthing. And if the edges start to split a little bit,\nthat is totally fine, you can just come in here and push them back together, if you want\na nice perfectly formed cookie, pretty cool, and now I am going to finish rolling those\nout. Now I am using a silicone-baking mat, this\nis an artisan mat brand, it is not necessary, you can use parchment paper if you like, I\nreally like these artisan mats, it really helps the cookie to not burn on the bottom,\nand you can re-wash it, they last a long time, I will put a link down below if you want to\npick one up, this batch is ready to go. So what we do is bake these in the oven, 375\ndegrees for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the edges get slightly brown, on to that step. All right after they come out of the oven,\njust let them set on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes then transfer them over to\na wire rack to cool completely. These turned out beautifully. All right our homemade peanut butter cookies\nare done, they smell amazing, they are really easy to do, if I can do it, you can do it.

Time for me to dive into one of these, oh\nyeah, grab this guy right here, mmm, mmm, amazing, super soft and chewy.", "UVeNB_wJa_A": "Today, on Sugar Spun run,  I'll be showing you how to make peanut butter oatmeal cookies. Peanut butter oatmeal cookies combine two of my favorite cookies, We're taking peanut butter cookies and oatmeal cookies and marrying them together for a cookie that's super buttery, super flavorful, and has a great, soft, chewy, texture. These cookies are super simple to make. They require very basic ingredients that you probably already have on hand and they only require 30 minutes to chill. Let's go ahead and get started. To make these cookies, we are going to be using all butter. A lot of peanut butter cookies use Crisco. I prefer to make mine using all butter for the best possible flavor. For today's recipe, we're going to need 10 tablespoons of unsalted butter and you want this to be softened to room temperature, go ahead and add this to your bowl, and then we'll add 2/3 cup of tightly packed light brown sugar, and just 1/4 cup of granulated sugar Now we are going to take an electric mixer and use this to beat the butter and the sugars together until it's really creamy and well combined. Now comes the peanut butter for this recipe. You're going to need a half cup of peanut butter. I prefer to use the creamy kind, but for a little extra texture or crunch, you can certainly use crunchy peanut butter instead. I do not recommend using natural peanut butter for this recipe. We will add this to our butter and sugar mixture and We will use our electric mixer to stir all of these ingredients together. Add one large egg, and one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Then we'll grab that mixer again and stir everything together until it's well combined With our wet ingredients nicely combined. Now, we are going to need the flour. This recipe uses 1 cup of all-purpose flour. As with many of my cookie recipes these peanut butter oatmeal cookies also use cornstarch. You're going to need a teaspoon of corn starch for this recipe. It's going to help keep these cookies nice and soft and chewy. We will also add 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Use a whisk or a spoon to stir together the dry ingredients until they're nicely combined. With our dry ingredients nicely combined. We'll go ahead and bring back our peanut butter mixture and add your dry ingredients to the wet batter. Now use your mixer on a low setting to gradually incorporate the ingredients. Now we'll add the oats. This recipe uses 1 cup of quick or instant oats. Add these into your batter and then I like to use a spatula to Combine everything until the oats are well incorporated. These oats help give these peanut butter oatmeal cookies such a nice, chewy texture. I really love it As I mentioned in the beginning our peanut butter oatmeal cookie dough is going to need to chill for at least 30 minutes before we can bake it. You'll want to cover your bowl with cling wrap and seal that up nicely and Now I'll go ahead and put this in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Once our cookie dough has chilled for at least 30 minutes and our oven has preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit it's time to bake our cookies. You will need a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper for this recipe. You're going to remove our plastic wrap and I'll use a 1 and 1/2 tablespoon size cookie scoop to scoop our cookie dough. As you can see, I like to make my cookies a heaping one and a half tablespoons. Now, we will just gently roll this cookie dough to form a ball and place that on our prepared cookie sheet. We'll repeat this process placing our cookie dough about two inches apart. Now we will bake these cookies in our 375 degree fahrenheit oven for about 8 to 11 minutes. What you're looking for is edges that are slightly golden brown You may notice that once your cookies are finished baking, even though the edges are slightly golden brown, The centers may still appear pretty undercooked. This is okay and exactly what you're looking for. We are going to allow our cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet. What this does is it allows our cookies to finish baking while they are cooling resulting in soft chewy cookies rather than dry Overcooked ones that you would get if you let the Centers cook completely in the oven. That is how you make peanut butter oatmeal cookies. These have such a great flavor thanks to the peanut butter and the fact that we used all butter instead of shortening I think you guys are going to love these cookies and they're soft Chewy texture. Look at that I really hope that you guys will try out this recipe and please if you do leave me a comment and let me know what you think. I love hearing from you. Thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time.", "6eSK9TQi0IU": "this is a three ingredient no measure cookie so that their ingredients are a jar of peanut butter a whole box of dark brown sugar and a few eggs that's all so if you wouldn't mind could you empty this full jar because like I said we're not gonna measure right into the mixer whole thing goes in here and I'm going to put in him up the dark brown sugar this recipe is super simple and today we're using the lg double oven range with probate convection it's inspired by pro style ranges first of all this double oven I want one so bad because it has literally two ovens you can do two things at two different temperatures at the same time it's really no I love them they max out our kitchen here on the show I love them very much I love you algae it's a really great oven that's going to make our cookies it's very cool I'm hoping one falls off the truck at the end of the season if I just complimented enough frost so it's everything I drag in there a bag of brown sugar an entire jar of peanut butter oh my god I'm gonna have to go back to the gym twice in one day and we're using smooth peanut butter but if you like you know crunchy cookie you can put in some crunchy peanut butter right so I'm putting on three eggs add your eggs one at a time and that's the most measuring you have to do I have to be able to do is count to three make this recipe that's all that's really it I could get now if you like a salty dessert like Rachael night I love best is that is the salt he puts salt on a lot of his cookie creations and I just had a little pinch of salt goes in but it's optional right if you don't yeah if you watch your sweeter cookie or if you want a sweeter cookie don't add the salt a little salt goes in and he garnishes it with salt as well I'm humming it nice and crunchy um so now we're going to turn that off and if you wouldn't mind helping we're gonna put six of these on each sheet tray yeah you just big mounds just like this Oh big mounds yeah because they're gonna flatten out a little bit since there's no flour in these oh not you additionally since there is no flour these are gluten free as well so if you have any oh my god people are gonna download this sucker the Internet's gonna blow up and also there's no calories no fat no I wish I wish I'm gonna have to jog home from here today um so we're gonna pop these in the oven now the cool thing about this oven everything is all about this oven there's a lot of cool things I wasn't even gonna use it all right opine not to burn myself mmm um so what they've done with this oven is they see there there's a hole where I stole them they've moved the heat element from the bottom of the oven to the back wall of the oven so it gives you that like equal even browning even browning on the top so no matter what rack you put it on you're gonna have a perfectly Brown cookie every single time very clever is not awesome very clever so measure a 3-ingredient also happens to be gluten-free eat peanut butter cook you guys have heard of a baker's dozen this is a Rachel dozen because there's only 11 I think these are brilliant grant and again thank you a huge shout out to our friends at LG they've really hooked us up I mean everything here it's better than my kitchen at home I get really sad and I have to go home um but you know what is even cooler is I'm gonna take the warm ones too we have a couple trays of cookies everybody get dry one you", "sAfmWt-fkj8": "we're recording home alone for the cooking show ends here virtually and

of these little tablespoons that's probably too big but whatever you can eyeball it not I'm not being too precise with this into the freezer all of these nice little chunks go look at my freezer like there's I think I can make some room here got some lemon shell out like a lot of little nips and stuff over here because that's why wouldn't you have all those but look at this buttery stock I don't know why I have buttery stock but I have buttery snack so guys I'm gonna try to squeeze this in over here ice cream she's gonna take an ice cream break this is good hey everyone camera three farad exotic and lighting Faraday sat again it's star colony redirector Faraday's that again producer [Applause] but if you found yourself to just only have creamy peanut butter and you did want to put some chunky peanut butter in there but you don't to buy chunky peanut butter chopped up some peanuts and mix it into your creamy peanut butter and look now we also even have some snack and peanut butter snacking peanut butter is really good with yes Ritz crackers I bought these unlike women the other day three that's only worth selling its a bodega then about be a butter now I can't talk you could probably hear like the that gross like nut peanut butter sound it's that masticating sound that's also a word masticate sounds suspiciously familiar to something else we all know that everyone's doing during isolation because they got nothing else to do okay let's move on we're gonna make the cookie dough one cup of creamy peanut butter and I need also my butter which I left my butter over by I left it to soften in the sunlight and then my butter which is nice and soft right in the sunlight look at that don't my plants - oh they are beautiful that's how you have to soften things in the old sunlight yes I don't have a microwave um also you don't want to melt melt your butter you know these when it's soft so this is nice soft just plop right in there did you see that plop in the year we've got our creamy peanut butter our sunlit softened butter oh I'm gonna start reading that into ingredients and so like recipes son what softened butter we're gonna cream our butter and our peanut butter with two kinds of sugar we're using brown sugar and granulated sugar we need a little bit more snack time peanut butter mm-hmm mm-hmm what you guys gonna be masticating - crema okay so once upon a time for you guys I did a giant cookie bowl recipe and I talked about the importance of creaming butter and why use brown sugar granulated sugar roll that footage brown sugar has molasses in it and it's going to give more moisture and make the cookies a little bit more fluffy stuff like that okay so I'm gonna add one egg at a time but it's a large thank you do you see how big that is we had a little bit of a no one here I'm not measuring it shed that it's like it's he's been she was gonna eyeball it drop me more for good measure look at the beautiful like it's so pretty like that's so crazy no no I'm not even high but I wish I was baking soda give a little swirl just like this really do this really doing no I'm really doing there okay [Music] Cicely it's like a very soft dough right now right it's beautiful so one time and I was making this I left it in the fridge and it hardened up a lot also since I didn't cover it it like dried out and so I was trying to roll the balls and I tell you what Roland falls dry you need it need that Lube ok it was really difficult to do yep they said it I said it I went there this is a masticating ball Roland needin lubes show today it's better to roll it while it's still soft is my point this is cookie dough right here like you can eat this and go for it if I can cook it like that away you go it's delicious also it tastes really good right now just mmm well so I'm not gonna tell Manila ok don't be a little we're gonna roll our balls now okay clean hands it's far easier to do this we're gonna roll about ten remember I made the cookie chunks but I made the chunky peanut butter ten balls so we're gonna make ten balls of these two these need to be quite big because you're filling it with peanut butter and jelly I usually roll the balls out and freeze them uncooked and then I can just bake cookies whenever I want like the single cookies or whatever my ovens on I'm like my little throw cookie in there that's really smart it is really smart so our balls are rolled these are ready to go or jelly these are balls of cookie dough but above my buttery stop and then these are cookie dough look at cookie dough everywhere and yeah I do like big balls okay I'm gonna regret that here is our frozen chunky peanut butter look at this clean that our beautiful balls I was so artistic look at my oh my go a little slower I'm gonna do a little patty well patty cake just like this and then we're gonna do like a little like a half a teaspoon maybe of jelly this is strawberry jelly so you can use grape jelly you can use any jelly you prefer I really like the strawberry with this so add that there see the nice and frozen so it's good and then we're just gonna like fold it around it I know it's weird and it's gonna break everywhere like it's gonna break and that's totally fine because what we're gonna do is like this and you can steely it back up roll your balls again and it's fine like I actually really love it when like I've baked these some times and the peanut butter and the jelly kind of like break through the surface I don't know it's fine it's like rustic or whatever like this is not a big deal so I think that putting the jelly on the bottom the thing is like the peanut butter kind of holds it in if you put the jelly on top it kind of just drips everywhere because I don't know it's jelly what's different strained jelly and jam I can't say this joke on YouTube jelly my worry to bake it made 10 so what I'm gonna do is spread these out over to baking sheets everyone usually has peanut butter and really this is a great quarantine recipe I think it's a great I mean this is a great recipe in general bacon 375 I think it's like 18 minutes gonna rotate I'm halfway through [Music] these guys look like don't worry about all right you look amazing look they're perfect look at this oh goodness Wow Wow I'd like to have them while they're so warm because you get that like gooey chunky peanut butter from the middle I love that crackle like that to me is kind of iconic I mean look like I said even like the the thump rhiness of the top of it it's totally fine like that noise oh man is it so good I really don't really good win they're hot like this when they cool down their son you're just good these are good cookies oh man this is what comes from having just looking in the pantry and being like what do I have a lot of peanut butter and jelly nice so much jelly mmm crunchy peanut butter is chew gum like it has a nice hint of the jelly peanut butter it's like a creamy peanut butter then the crunchy peanut butter has a good texture you're getting all those like different layers it's this is better than a peanut butter and jelly team IDs are so good these are still not healthy

beat the band here I got my weather text this morning and they said six to seven inches of snow so dave was like yay he is my northern boy he loves snow so I like it - reminds us of when we lived up north but they'll get pretty excited here about it because we don't get a lot of snow here okay so we've added our flour and our baking soda [Music] all right so that is it goes together really easy and now we're gonna make some cookies and we will get going with that here just get some of this up here this is a great cookie dough and it has a lot of peanut butter in it so you know you really get that great flavor of peanut butter in there alright let's move this bad boy out of the way so we can have a little more room we'll get this top here okay now I am making some cookies these cookies today to take down to my neighbor at the end of the block you know our whole block our neighbors and I'm gonna take them down to Mike today because he had surgery and I'm gonna put them down some peanut butter cookies I think you'll really like that okay scootch this year okay so here is our peanut butter dough there's a nut look delicious alright so let's get our cookie meat here I'm gonna show you how to get these prepared now um using parchment on the cookie sheet today so now what we're going to do is we're going to take and you don't have to chill these you can just get to working with them right away I'm gonna take about an inch sized piece of dough I like that and then just want to roll it in your hands just roll it so we end up with that and then we're gonna toss it right into a bowl of granulated sugar and we're just gonna roll it around just get it coated with a little sugar then we're gonna put it right here on our let's just do a couple more just because it's fun because we like to make cookies especially when it's snowing I'll probably be in my kitchen all day today I guarantee ya I might hammer out another cooking video all right so we just roll that and some granulated sugar and you just keep going till your cookie sheet is full and then you want to pop these into a 350 oven and then we're gonna talk about the time here that you need to bake these I'm just gonna do one more here and we'll set this aside so you would just fill your cookie sheet just for them you know a couple inches apart is good enough so let's just go ahead and move this out of the way and then bring this down and I just took those out of the oven so I'm going to show you all right now so these were done in a 350 oven and you want to bake these right about for me it's exactly 12 minutes but what I want you to look out for is this right here so see when they just start to crack see the cracks here right when they start to crack is when you want to take them out because this is what's gonna make them stay nice and chewy and have that right texture so if you bake them longer they would be hard so we don't want that we want to bake them so they stay nice soft and chewy so 350 oven right at 12 minutes start checking it about nine and a half ten because you know all ovens are a little different so that's what you want to do when you just start seeing these little cracks on the top that's when you want to take them out and see they're just perfect like golden on the and then when you crack these open they look like that see how they just stay super soft and delicious but they're really kind of like a shortbread too because see how they kind of just melt and kind of come apart they're just super delicious and that's what I love about this peanut butter cookie is that the texture is awesome the the flavor is awesome I want you guys to give them a try this is our peanut butter cookie", "RPBycKAA8fI": "[Music] we're gonna make some peanut butter cookies this recipe is really easy explore ingredients there's no flour and we have to have muscle power show me your muscles oh let me see let me see your muscles Oh big muscles let me see your muscles where's your muscles what is that a muscle the first thing I want to do a Boleyn why don't you take this peanut butter put that into the bowl so while Evelyn does that I'm gonna let you know make sure the whole thing number over the bowl yep there you go can I help you with the step just scrape it like this we just like that it's great I scrape it off Eli the next step is the sugar you got about a cup so go ahead and put in here he did oh you want to take this egg crack it right here and put it right into here okay good job okay go ahead and crack it in here whoa good job now put the shells right here I'm gonna see what I'll do is just go like this a little bit you want to mix it up a little bit yeah and Haviland see right there that container mmm smell it smells good do you know what that is that's called vanilla mmm so I'm gonna add me now and then we're gonna stir it up and that's our cookie dough so going for the nail in there so we're gonna take turns I want you to stir it like this so cuz we're gonna mix it in like this and so it looks like cookie dough okay okay how about you take ten turns and I want you to help count okay one two you gotta count with me three four five six seven eight nine ten show me how you guys eat chocolate chip cookies I ain't burgers like this okay look our batter is done it's not awesome next we're gonna scoop it out but

put it right here um let me see what's wrong what's going on yeah sometimes you have to do it like that see that do we make these cookies don't we you lie sometimes after school right yeah and then what's your favorite part about eating cookies you're licking what yeah it's so yummy uline knows how to do this show your friend how to make this yeah yeah do you know what that's called Eli crisscross we just want that traditional cookie cutter stamp one thing that's worth mentioning is you want to use a natural peanut butter and there are different types of natural peanut butters and there's ones that have oil that's it at the time that's the type of thing where you definitely don't want to use because your cookie will spread too much you want to look for the peanut butter with the oil that's not at the top so if you've flipped the container over if it does have oil sitting in the top you'll be able to see it when you flip it over and you'll see it sitting on the cap so you want to use an all-natural peanut butter without the oils do you want this if you bake homemade cookies you know this is called the bakers reward this is what you get for making homemade cookies that's your reward where's yours okay mmm what does it taste like really tastes really good wait till we bake them should go ahead and bake them in the oven I'm gonna bake them for about 10 to 12 minutes and they're gonna come out and they're gonna be yummy and then we could take them to the park well hey one at the booties put the birds in cookie jail right cookie jail [Music] get the full recipe from today's episode on PBS parents kitchen explorers [Music] [Applause]", "yJnd_FMBL5s": "I'm Candice the Edgy Veg, your friendly vegan cookie monster  and today were going to make peanut butter cookies  the most important ingredient for peanut butter cookies  we're going to need peanut butter  The second ingredient were going to need is half a cup of earth balance you're slowly going to beat those two\ntogether well simultaneously adding three-quarter cups of sugar Joke break, two peanuts were walking down the street  one was assaulted so when you're sick of mixing take a break and add 2 tablespoons of molasses  now you want to make sure that you're using molasses or light molasses not blackstrap molasses  it may look like chocolate but it sure as hell doesn't taste like chocolate  so don't taste it  were also going to add 1 teaspoon of vanilla maybe a little bit more vanilla never killed anyone  mix that until well combined  its combined enough for me  now going to add a cup and a quarter of flour.   add half first and half later anesthesia cookies bind together and\nyou're going to need two tablespoons the to make these cookies bind together you're going to need 2 tablespoons of cornstarch  and to make the cookies rise you're going to need a quarter teaspoon of baking powder  am just like our assaulted peanut, were going to add half a teaspoon of Himalayan rock salt because table salt is crap  now we're going to add the rest of our flour. there comes a point in every mixers life where it just cant do anymore work.  you have to get in with your hands so if you're going to want  mould these into walnut sized lets say a little bit bigger than walnut-sized if it does not stick together, just add a little bit of water. or your favorite non-dairy milk we're going to grease our pan today, with a plastic bag and some earth balance and there you have a greased pan! and your hands are clean. now take your balls and lightly pressed them between your thumb and index finger or with two hands and put them on a cookie sheet then you're going to take a fork and press it down one way, then press it down the opposite way so you have a pan of delicious almost peanut butter cookies, so we're going to put those in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes there are many things you can do while you wait.  I like to practice. my Tom Cruise samurai skills! so after ten minutes you want to take them out and let them cook for a little bit longer on the pan that will ensure that they're crispy on\nthe outside that super soft on the inside so after you've let them sit for about five to ten minutes, you'll get something that looks like this. they're crunchy on the inside, and soft on the inside now take them off and put them on a plate for your friends before you eat them all I'm Candice, the Edgy Veg and I want to know what your favorite cookies are Leave me a comment below, and make sure you subscribe to StillCurrent Studios (it's right up there) and be sure to follow me on Twitter.  Bye.", "oTXzTl3Xy4Q": "hi I'm Diane cometa and today edition would die I'm gonna show you how to make peanut butter cookies these are classic cookies with lots of peanut butter flavor and they're simple to make so let's get started indicial would die I love peanut butter cookies and these couldn't be easier to make so the first thing we're gonna do is get our dry ingredients going and of course we start with some flour so we have all-purpose flour here and I'm just gonna loosen it up in my bin a little and then spoon it right into my measuring cup just like this get it coming up over the top and you just take a knife and you just level it off and you would just want to dump this into a bowl so already have some in there and now we're gonna add a leavening so I'm going to use some baking powder and some baking soda because we want these cookies to be crisp and then we lent them to like rise a little bit and then we're gonna need some salt because we want the flavors to come out as much as possible so I'm just gonna add a little bit of salt and then grab a whisk and just whisk the whole thing together and get it really thoroughly combined and then you're just gonna set this aside now we're gonna get started with our mixer so I'm using a stand mixer for this you can use a hand mixer and a mixing bowl if you want to and we're going to start with some softened unsalted butter and this is at room temperature so it's really nice and soft and I'm just gonna dump this into my mixing bowl just like that and I'm gonna give this a couple of spins around just to kind of smooth it out a little bit and then I'm gonna add in some sugar so for this recipe I'm gonna use some brown sugar and some white granulated sugar now when you measure a brown sugar you get the sugar into your measuring cup and you need to press it down so it comes up to the top of the measuring cup and then just dump that into your mixing bowl so it should come out like and you know a little solid piece almost and then for the white sugar you're just gonna pour that into your measuring cup just like this and then just level that off with the back of the knife and then dump that into the mixing bowl as well and you're gonna mix this for about three minutes until it becomes really nice and pale in color and kind of fluffy looking give it a little scrape about halfway through just to make sure that you get everything from the bottom of the bowl nice and light and fluffy just the way we like it and now for the main ingredient our peanut butter go ahead and put that into the mixture here we're gonna give this a few good spins around and really thoroughly combined gonna give it a little scrape because we don't want anything laying down there like a big blob of peanut butter or something and then just run that around again and make sure everything's really mixed through for now the next ingredient is an egg and we have some pure vanilla extract here so I cracked my egg into a separate bowl because I want to make sure there's no shells in it and I also want to make sure my egg is good and then the pure vanilla extract I'm just gonna go ahead and put this into the same bowl with my egg and then I'm just gonna whisk this around and just kind of get it lightly combined and then I'm going to turn the mixer on here and just add that right on in and then run that around and get that really mixed through you're probably we're gonna have to scrape the sides in the bottom of your bowl to make sure it's really mixed well well that's all mixed through and the last thing to do is add in the dry ingredients so here we go you just turn the mixer on low and just kind of dump it in there and you just want to get it mixed through just until that flour disappears there we go and now I'm just gonna scrape this off I'll mix any of the flour that might be around the sides of the bowl I'm gonna take that and just scrape that with my spatula and mix that through by hand just like this because I don't want to over mix my batter and there is our cookie dough so now we have to chill this so this needs to go in the fridge for at least two hours or overnight or you can even freeze this for up to two months now you could just put a piece of plastic wrap over your bowl but what I like to do is take a separate bowl and I just go ahead and dump it in there because this bowl is just too giant to fit in my refrigerator the right way so when your dough is chilled you want to get your oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and put the rack in the center position so let that oven preheat for a good 20 minutes before you start baking your cookies I will show you how we do that in just a second so my cookie dough is chilled and you can see this is nice and firm now and that's what you want you don't want it to be soft because what'll happen is if you bake them when they're not cold enough they're gonna flatten out in the oven so they need to start off nice and chilled so when the butter in there hits the oven it melts slowly if it's too warm it's just gonna go swish and then your cookie is gonna be like a pancake not a cookie okay so now what I have here to get myself ready is I have two baking sheets that I've lined with parchment paper and then on this plate here I have some white granulated sugar so just regular sugar and then I also have a fork so what you want to do is get about a tablespoon of dough so I'm going to use an ice cream scoop here this is about a 1 tablespoon scoop and once you scoop it out then you want to just go ahead and put it in your hand like this and roll it into a ball and then put it on your baking sheet you just want to space your cookies about two to three inches apart so that they don't run into each other when they're baking so if you want to make sure there's enough room so when they spread out they don't collide so fill up your baking sheet once you get all your cookies on the sheet take your fork dip it into the sugar and then go ahead and press the cookie down and then carefully lift up the fork and then go again and press it down in the other direction making those characteristic hash marks so keep going and making little designs all over your cookies now all my cookies have the beautiful hash marks in them and they're ready to bake in my preheated oven 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes after they're done and they're nice and golden brown I'm going to remove them and set them on the counter for 5 minutes on the sheet and then remove them to a cooling rack to cool completely now in between you want to take your cookie dough and pop it in the fridge don't let it sit down on the counter and you want to have that second baking sheet because you don't want to put the dough onto a hot baking sheet so once you're done with this fill up your other sheet and then go ahead and pop that into the oven so when they're done then we're gonna get a glass of milk and enjoy these babies and here it's my lovely little plate of cookies and I'm just gonna grab one right here and I am just gonna dunk one in a glass of milk but I want to show you all the nice little layers in there look you can see there's little tiny pockets that's little tiny pockets of air and then when you bite into it it's like a little bit crisp and it has a lot of peanut butter flavor and you get your nice little glass of milk because for me if I have a big glass of milk I'm gonna eat a whole bunch of cookies so if I have a little glass I won't eat as much unless of course I go fill it up again look what happened mmm the bottom is crisp top is little crisp with the sugar that you put on there and lots of peanut butter flavor they're really good classic I have other classic cookie recipes go on my website Disher

butter cookies so easy just four ingredients I hope everyone's doing well today let's get started of course we're going to start with one box of cake mix yellow cake mix any brand is fine we're going to add a half cup of oil you can use a half a cup of butter if you want to eggs this is large eggs and a half a cup of peanut butter I'm using creamy you can use crunchy if you'd rather but I just like the creamy best now we're just going to combine these ingredients together as you can see this forms a soft dough so I'm going to cover this with plastic wrap and let it refrigerate for about an hour if you have to leave it longer that's fine too we just want it to firm up a little bit before we bake it the dough has firmed up so we're going to go ahead and get it on the pan I like to use just a round spoon but this is a one tablespoon measuring spoon one thing I learned about baking cookies really learned it the hard way is if you don't have them all about the same size some will be hard some will be underdone but if you have them all about the same size usually if one is done they're all done and I like my cookies a little on the chewy side versus crunchy this makes about 28 to 30 cookies what you want to do is just take a fork and make the signature crisscross pattern on each cookie I'll bake these for about 10 minutes keeping an eye on them and then they'll be ready these are so easy and so delicious you don't want to miss out thank y'all so much for watching please like and subscribe and we'll see you next time", "Rr3UmLiomhk": "[Music] today I'm going to show you how to make these no bake peanut butter coconut cookies and they are incredible we just made this batch came fresh out of the fridge and they stay really well together you store them in the fridge and try not to eat them too quickly I guess that's the biggest tip I can give you so this is a really simple recipe I'm going to show you everything that goes into it toss it together and then we're going to put it in the fridge a bit so it can harden up so for the base of this we're going to use some good old coconut oil so we're going to start with 1/4 of a cup of coconut oil to that we are going to add 1/4 of a cup of PB 2 so we like to always have this on hand it's a lower calorie peanut butter powder if you don't have this that's totally fine you can replace it with some coconut flour it creates a good bulking for the cookie and it really pulls through that peanut butter flavor so coconut flour will work just as well fourth of a cup of peanut butter powder next we're going to add half a cup of coconut flakes so here we have unsweetened coconut flakes these are bigger chips you can also get the shredded but we like use big chips it creates more of a bulk you really taste that coconut Museums both on hand but either will work next we are going to add half a cup of crunchy peanut butter so we always get crazy Richards it's definitely the best nutritionally we found in terms of sugar a lot of crunchy peanut butters you'll find have sugar in them or they're higher carb so you definitely want to be checking labels when it comes to peanut butter but if you find any crunchy peanut butter other than this one that has good nutrition that'll work oh my god this looks so good already so next the next two ingredients are completely optional we're going to start with a quarter teaspoon of salt it just pulls through the flavor a lot more so we like to add it and the next ingredient is liquid stevia we always have this on hand as well we're going to add about 10 drops and this makes it more of a dessert so if you don't need that desert sweetness you can totally omit this and then all you got to do is mix it up that looks good to me so once you get it fully incorporated you're going to want to put it in the freezer for 10 minutes so I'll see you back soon it's been just about 10 minutes and this is what you're looking for it's not rock-hard but it's pretty hard and it will mold perfectly into our cookies to make our cookies we like to use a cookie scooper it's definitely my favorite tool in the house but if you don't have one that's totally fine you can use a spoon to just scoop it out and make individual clumps which will be your cookie then also repurpose balls and off to be uniform whatever you like you're going to eat it anyway okay so let's scoop if you find that it's a little too hard you can let it sit out for a couple minutes there's one [Music] so that we have just a little bit left over that you can just sneak and eat and not tell anyone but we made seven perfectly uniform no bake cookies so we are going to put these in the fridge let them reharden then they're good to go they're good to eat just store them in the fridge like I said you can change up the variations you don't need PB powder if you don't have any coconut flour work great we like big chunks of coconut flakes you can use the shredded and that's that's that right oh I got a try them is not the best part of any recipe video all right I'm going to put these in get the other ones out and I'll try them for you so these have been in the fridge for an entire day now so they're just there ready to go these are really really premium and if the same exact time have a really nice crunch to them that's not perfect I don't know what is they're not like overly sweet either so you know you can mess around with the ingredients with the flavors have fun with it these are our and nobody cookies comment below let us know if you make these any variations or if you have other flavors you want us to try out don't forget to subscribe and keep coming back for some delicious recipes [Music]", "BY5ItnYTGFQ": "hi guys today on divas can cook we are making these soft and chewy peanut butter chip

that large bowl okay looks good girl hurry up okay now we're gonna add some butter butter butter softened butter dump it in a bowl and I'm gonna add some butter flavor shortening now yes you can use all butter but that shortening honey honey honey it makes the texture so chewy I just like the I just like shortening okay I love it okay go ahead and mix this on up until it is nice and creamy and combined like this right here wonderful okay next we're gonna add in our egg all right there's my eggs right there I have one egg and then I have one egg yolk so there's my whole egg going in make sure your eggs are room attempt and Shaw and there's my little egg yolk kind of just dump that in and then I'll get my mixer and just mix it up really really well let me tell you normally I don't even like peanut butter cookies like they kind of like you know thin and crispy but if they are nice and soft like this mm-hmm yeah these things are my type of hop okay now here's some vanilla extract I'm gonna add this in here you can also edit some butter flavoring if you want to and now it's time but the peanut butter make sure you use a good brand of peanut butter I like to use like Skippy or Peter Pan or the bee's knees brand those three makes some of the best peanut butter cookies I just really really like it don't use that natural guy that has so all in it mm-hmm don't use it not for cookies okay let's move on to our dry ingredients I'm gonna add my flour into a large bowl and that's just some regular all-purpose flour now I'm gonna add in some salt some baking powder and some baking soda dump that in your Bowl and now whisk whisk whisk you can also like sift it but honey that little whisk and just get busy and just you know handle everything you'll need no sifter okay so that looks great now I'm gonna add my dry ingredients into my wet ingredients then just get your little spatula here and kind of mix it around until it forms like a nice soft dough you don't want to overmix this just mix it up until you know a dough begins to form and then you can add in those peanut butter chips I love these things I can sit and eat these little chips are so good go ahead and dump your little peanut butter chips in there if you have some crushed peanuts you can also add some crushed peanuts to it but yeah I don't really like nuts my clickers so I'm a teeny all right now see there's our beautiful salt dough it's all part a peanut butter dough I love this dough okay so now we're ready to go ahead and plot these onto our baking sheet go ahead and get you some of your little scoop here and then I'm gonna go ahead and just pop this right onto my baking sheet that I have lined with parchment paper just like that about maybe two inches apart okay now if you want them to be like little cute chubby cookies you can leave them just like this okay you don't have to flatten them out you can put the little chips in them to make them look more prettier when they get done baking but I like mine to be a little bit bigger so I'm gonna go ahead and just kind of you know press them down just like this flatten them down a little bit because these cookies really don't spread out too much you know so you want to go ahead and press them down if you want them to be a little bit bigger and not a little short fat cookies okay now I'm gonna add my little morsels on top this is just so you know that it looks perfect and then I'm just gonna bake it at 350 for about six to seven minutes these will be underdone when they come out of the oven that's the key to being that chewy chewy cookie don't bake them the full time they have to come out really early and then they finish cooking on the pan and they can go ahead and place them on the cooling rack to finish cooling off that is a ticket do not overcook these cookies because then they'll be crunchy not as you want crunchy cookies I don't like crunchy peanut butter cookies so yeah under baked under baked under baked that will get you the Bob cookies okay enough talking girl let's look at the inside of these cookies because I'm telling you honey these cookies are so chewy and they stay this way they stay this way for like days because of the under baking look at them mm-hmm soft chewy love it but that's it you guys I hope you enjoyed this video don't forget to subscribe and check out my other videos later", "-R---M659yA": "[Music] dude did you see that hang on I've got just the thing today I'm going to show you how to make a delicious peanut butter cookie that'll power you up with protein and fiber so stick around welcome back to new recipes I'm mark Matsumoto and I'm here to show you how to elevate your everyday meals so smack that subscribe button and blast that Bell so you don't miss out these tender nutty cookies are made with just a handful of wholesome ingredients but they pack about 7 grams of protein per cookie so let's start off by checking out the ingredients we're gonna be using 55 grams or about half a cup of rolled oats 60 grams or about half a cup of chickpea flour a hundred grams or a heaping half cup of coconut sugar and a half teaspoon of baking soda our wet ingredients are 1 and a quarter cups of chunky peanut butter 1/4 cup of rice syrup 3 tablespoons of water and one teaspoon of vanilla extract there's a lot of room for substitution here so hit the link in the description for my full post pro tip when you're measuring out a thick syrup or even peanut butter line your spoons and cups with a thin layer of vegetable oil this will make the surface nonstick so even this gooey rice syrup will slide right out of the spoon the first thing you want to do is preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius which is about 355 Fahrenheit now I'm gonna make oat flour by grinding the rolled oats in a clean coffee grinder if you don't have one a blender or a mortar and pestle will work too then we're gonna dump this into a bowl along with the chickpea flour coconut sugar and baking soda and then we're gonna use a spoon to stir it all together I've use chickpea flour because it has double the protein and four times the amount of fiber of all-purpose flour but this should work with almost any kind of flour you have on hand when the mixture is evenly combined I'm gonna add the peanut butter rice syrup and vanilla and start to mix that together once it starts forming a shaggy dough I'm gonna add the water and mix that together until it comes together into a uniform dough it should be about the texture of play-doh so if it's too wet add some more flour and if it's too crumbly add some more water now I'm gonna spread a sheet of parchment paper onto a baking sheet if you have a non-stick pan this isn't necessary but it does make cleanup a whole lot easier okay let's go ahead and shape the dough into balls you want them to be about the size of a ping-pong ball and you can make them bigger or smaller depending on the size of the cookie you want be sure to roll them so that the surface is nice and smooth otherwise they're gonna fall apart when you try to flatten them when I'm stuck on a boss battle or bogged down with writer's block taking a fifteen minute break to bake a batch of these cookies is the perfect way to reset my mind if you have kids at home doing distance learning this is the perfect brain break to take mid morning so you have an afternoon snack this dough doesn't spread too much in the oven so you can place them fairly close together but be sure to leave enough room to flatten the cookies in the next step now we're gonna go around and flatten these cookies with the fork I like to give it a press and Wonder action and then turn the fork 90 degrees and press them again to get a nice crosshatch pattern just be sure to hold the fork parallel to the surface of the pan so the cookies are an even thickness it's normal for these to crack a bit when you flatten them but if they're falling apart you either need to roll the balls smoother where your dough may have been a bit too dry now I'm gonna pop these into my convection oven for about seven minutes every oven is a little different though and you may need to experiment a few times to come up with the perfect timing for your oven when they're done set the tray on a wire rack and let the cookies cool completely depending on how long do you bake them for these cookies can be moist and chewy crisp and crumbly or somewhere in between just adjust your baking times up or down to get the perfect texture for you aside from being nutty and delicious these cookies are loaded with protein and fiber which makes them a satisfying snack and they go great with a tall glass of cool milk if you want to step up your game you can add chocolate chips or just cut to the chase and dip them in melted chocolate you can also press them out a little flatter to make sandwich cookies stuffed with peanut butter or marshmallow fluff [Music] these cookies are a quick delicious fix and they'll power you up to take on anything so whether you're an herbivore and carnivore omnivore or roba more I hope you'll give these a try if you enjoyed this video you can let me

like leveling up your characters and weapons by eating a balanced diet of bad guys well I'm gonna polish off a few more bosses and this plate of cookies but I'll catch you in the next one [Music] you [Music]", "74-7i0gPNFc": "what's happening guys today imma show how to make your own Lenny's and Larry style peanut butter protein cookie except this cookie it has half the calories of the Lonny's and Larry's cookie almost twice as much protein and it's way cheaper I don't want these and Larry's protein cookie so let's get cooking okay so first things first you're gonna need a food scale for this recipe so if you don't have a food scale you can pick one up in the video description below also we're gonna be using pb2 for our peanut butter PB cheese just peanut flour you don't have PB 2 you grab some that in the video description below as well okay so now that that's out the way we can start the recipe the first thing we're adding is 1/3 of a cup of the PB 2 to a small bowl along with the tablespoon of oat flour and guys don't bioW far you can just make a flour at home throw some oats in your blender blend them until they turn into a flour type consistency and just storm in a ziplock bag like I do next we're gonna add 1/3 of a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder I went with ice appears a low-carb protein powder for this recipe we're also gonna add a small pinch of salt as well as 2 tablespoons of unsweetened vanilla almond milk lastly just add a half teaspoon to a teaspoon of the liquid sweetener of your choice however if you're using liquid stevia in particular you'll probably need to use a teaspoon maybe even a little more all right so now I can take a spatula and mix all the ingredients until crumbly once everything kind of gets crumbly we can use our hands to start forming a cookie dough and when the cookie dough takes shape you just spray our work surface area with a little baking spray add the dough and start forming our cookie once your cookie takes shape though just take out a fork and score the top of your cookie just like you would with any other peanut butter cookie and then at this point you can pop your cookie in the fridge for an hour and eat it as a no baked cookie or you can microwave for 10 seconds let it set for a minute or two and eat it warm and gooey like I like to do I think it's so delicious that way and of course it's always enjoy guys just a couple of pro tips guys when you make this cookie just make sure that you use a food scale because the amounts that you're using in your bowl they need to be sort of exact otherwise it can get too wet or too dry and you don't want that to happen to you also when you're kind of forming your cookie dough it might seem like it's too dry but if you work your dough enough a cookie dough will form it just takes a little bit of effort as far as the macros on the cookie it's 208 calories 6 grams of fat 22 grams of carbs 7 of which is fiber and 25 grams of protein if you want the full recipe with the metric measurements all to the gram you find that in the video description below hope you guys enjoyed today's video hope you enjoy the cookie thanks for watching see in the next video", "WgQzH_O7DA8": "hey dudes we've been doing a lot of fitness videos recently but we're back in the kitchen again because a lot of the battle is going to be proper nutrition protein peanut butter cookies if you didn't think cookies could fit in your diet well you haven't had these yet low in carbohydrates high in healthy fats and great for that lean protein source two eggs real simple whole eggs cracking that bowl one two all right we're going to get all the liquid stuff done first we just need a teaspoon of vanilla extract you can just use the cap right here to be a lot easier to measure it out the Truvia or stevia sweetener about 1/4 a cup here and dump it in or get the solid ingredients we're just going to mix the liquid ingredients up in here it's going to get a nice consistency there we go okay so now for the solid 3/4 of a cup so I can a lot of that healthy fats in there helping you get that nice energy throughout the day 3/4 boom we're going to get 3/4 a cup of protein not a couple scoops in here I'm going to pour that in there I tell you it's going to take some muscle to mix this up because as you start mixing ups and get harder and harder got to use those nice for our muscles are they accentuate yeah for the grip strength the little pump they will not do overall sure it's nice and thick girl who told ya it's a workout alright there we go good consistency oh yeah nonstick spray buff dudes best friend right here get about the size of a ping pong ball about like that place it right there perfect all right now that the dough is done we not got to squish them down into cookie shape so this whey protein that I'm using as a substitute to flour that way it doesn't stick on the fork and that's exactly what the protein is used for in the recipe as well it's just a good substitute to flour same kind of consistency but obviously you get the nice maca nutrient of protein rather than a carbohydrate source oh yeah the oven is going to be preheated to 325 degrees now this is all going to depend on your specific oven mine burns a little hot so I'm actually doing a little less sometimes 350 works we're going to be putting it in once it's preheated to about 5 to 6 minutes again depending on your certain oven the oven is preheated and ready to go we're just going to take the cookie pan here slide it in so it's been about five six minutes I think they're done there we go we're just gonna turn the oven off gonna grab protectors here oh yes that looks delicious so what you're going to notice is a little bit of the grease from the fat is still surfacing on top so you let it sit for a while it's going to suck back into the cookies help them keep the nice moistness let them dry out let them cool off then you're going to take them off the pan put them on a little plate and they're ready to be served whoever thought milk and cookies could build a buff dude physique well with this great recipe it can so next time you want a little snack something on the go make protein peanut butter cookies and I'll bring you one step closer to being a well you know the rest you", "bByXeXz4iXQ": "what's up YouTube it's still unfold with another awesome tutorial today we're making peanut butter chocolate cookies [Music] this is one of my favorite cookie recipes from a website called modern honey I'll link to it in the description below to start we're gonna take a cup of butter and chop it up and put it in this bowl right here the recipe calls for cold butter a lot of them want you to melt it this one does not all right before we start the mixer we're gonna add a cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of regular sugar if you don't have brown sugar I just found out you can actually mix some molasses in with regular sugar and pack it just a little bit half a cup of regular sugar oops well too much it's alright to make a mess when you're cooking doesn't matter you can clean up later okay now we're gonna mix this so we need to mix it until it's light and fluffy which is about four minutes and fast-forward to it being done so let's look in light and fluffy now we're gonna add the eggs poke tip do your eggs in a bowl instead of straight into the mixer that way if you accidentally drop some shell it doesn't get lost in a cookie or if you hit your friends drop some shell in there who cares what are they going to do about it they're getting cookies add them one at a time the mixers down on low I always like to wash my hands if I touch raw egg I don't know if they're poisonous or not but that's the story eggs are mixed in there now we're gonna add half a cup of cocoa powder oops or thereabout baking is not an exact science close enough that'll work now we're gonna add a cup of cake flour this is one of the only cookie recipes I've seen that calls for cake flour ironically to make them taste less like cake and more like cookies one cup of cake flour coming right up is the worst package possible why don't they make packages that you can actually pour into the top 1/2 of regular flour all-purpose one down half to go this is also one of the only cookie recipes I've seen that calls for cornstarch so we're gonna add a teaspoon of that lunch one of these is the cheese bin this one little T there we go got that in there 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda ok we don't have a 3/4 but we have 1/4 we can use three of those cuz math one two three perfect half a teaspoon of salt I think the salt just some type of chemical reaction with the soda I'm unclear google it let me know but that's what it asked for all right now we stir it until combined start slow otherwise it's gonna make a mess if you have a stick thing use this to scrape down the sides it's kind of like a game of dodge the spinning death thing stop it and lift it up look at that monster just to make sure everything's getting mixed right bring it up and scrape down this and I know you'll probably want to taste it now and you can but it'll be ten times better after you put the peanut butter chips in if you can wait like 30 more seconds before you try it calls for a third of a cup of the peanut butter chips I don't know how much is in this bag but I bet it's about one of the third cups yep exactly one nut third cup Wow look at this be very careful not to go too high and launch your dough out it's very on the edge of wanting to launch out all right that's looking good now is when you can do your taste test yeah these are gonna be bomb all right scrape all the dough down back into the bowl do one more taste as just in case it changed between now and then nope still go all right so now we have to take this off we have to chill the dough for 10 minutes cover it with plastic so it doesn't dry out throw it in the fridge for 10 minutes and pre-heat your oven to 400 10 degrees not sure how she came up with that number but just do what she says all right so spend 10 minutes the ovens heated the cookies are cooled let's get him going so on the website she likes some massive she says you get 8 out of this one batter I don't necessarily like him that massive I like him normal sized and there's gonna be more than 8 people at the party so we need to make more than that but make him whatever size you like I don't care make some big some little you kind of want to do shape them like that they'll expand a little bit so make sure and leave a decent amount of space I used parchment she doesn't say to I guess I'm being a rebel I don't know so I get 9 on this pan and then we'll have another pan as well maybe we'll do one massive one just for fun and good to go all right we're gonna load this in to the 410 oven for 10 minutes she says they'll brown on the top but the cookies are brown so I don't know how you're gonna tell I was just 10 minutes and the proud of you fine maybe I'll be one big one I think this is about the size no not even this is probably about the size that she does it and that is a massive cookie if you want that go for it I don't need cookies that big so we'll just do one good to go look at this massive cookie that's gonna be second saying it's like it's like a cake cookie but it doesn't taste like cake she specifically says all right they've cooked for 10 minutes let them rest for 10 minutes and then they're good to go check out this massive one oh my god this is ridiculous oh I can't even this looks so good there all right pretty good try this recipe out and let me know when you think in the comments thanks for watching also if you're in my way or my camera view I'm just kidding thanks for watching if you have any ideas for other recipes you want me to make let me know in the comments so the best part of making cookies is sharing with your friends don't eat all of these because that would be ridiculous take them to a party hand them out whatever just don't eat them all please you didn't think I was actually gonna bake the GoPro did you", "QA0-QatRfKc": "[Music] hey guys it's Alicia and my daughter Alyssa who is going to be helping me today I thought it would show you our super easy quick recipe for peanut butter cookies that is absolutely delicious and just takes things that you probably already have in your pantry so if you're like us and you're not going out shopping that much right now this is perfect plus my daughter here does not do a whole lot of baking or cooking oh boy I tell you every time I try something especially on the stovetop there's always fire involved so yes so she's not real confident when it comes to cooking so I wanted to show her and help her help me with a recipe that is really really easy and then just kind of show her that she too can bake hey it's like they're ready to e quote anyone that's correct anyone can cook and this is a really easy recipe to show you that you can cook and this one actually comes from my mom so that makes it kind of special I have lots of memories growing up baking with my mom and so we're gonna do a little bit of that with my daughter today kind of share that experience pass it don't passing it on so let's get started here and I'm sure I'll show you real quick what you're gonna need to make these like I said very minimal ingredients at least I think I've said very minimal ingredients oh yeah so you're gonna need some peanut butter we got some Peter Pan in here use whatever kind you want that's what we got for this kid cuz she don't eat the line she goes through a ton of it so we get the bulk size of Costco not Cosmo Sam's then you're gonna need a pancake mix or baking mix and I've just got some Bisquick here that we're gonna be using then a 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk a little bit of sugar actually that's more than I actually need but some sugar to roll the cookies in and then some vanilla and that is all that you're gonna need for these that's super super super easy so let's get started don't count those all in one hand exactly there's five so first thing first we are using your mixer you don't have you can just do this in a bowl by hand if you want but you know why not use the mixer if you've got it make your life easier okay so what we're gonna do is basically just dump all the ingredients in here and then mix them up it does not get any easier than that in my opinion and actually well this is going you want your oven preheating to 350 so we're gonna start with our Bisquick and let's see you're gonna just put two paths of this in there so here's a knife just scoop it these cookies are resting on your shoulders yes yeah I don't know about the world the world here so I don't know if you know this but you just scoop it in scoop it and then you take the knife and run it or Frost so Stephen one cup I think you got most of that in there you got you get the other way yep there you go okay so get that in your other cup I'm gonna mix on the ovens on you guys isn't gonna be a mess with me in charge you have told your your french toast story oh yeah set it on I accept the French toast on fire and then I ruin the old pan oh I think I would have a funny youtube channel of how to knock this a little difficult in this box yeah genius picnic right across okay don't go in there okay and then we're gonna take our peanut butter and you are gonna want 3/4 cup which is that fill now you can actually probably use your way just scoop it out is to get yeah let's take the knife and I just got this quick in our peanut butter for that perfect well this is your plant litter we've got this pipe in your bar sure it's fine there's bugs right well in in the process yeah it's not none of this but like to knowing that this so now you're gonna take the knife we're running around the edge to get that out of there yeah just like that [Music] just break that out okay now the can of sweetened condensed milk can we open that for you whoa yeah the sweetened condensed milk is a tweet so pour that in and that sweetened condensed milk is basically taking the place of sugar that you would put in here because it is so sweet so it's kind of like the sugar and the dairy all in one yeah just take a knife scrape it out here did you start cooking like what age when did I start cooking like really start cooking not until I was in my thirties Wow yeah I feel better now I never used to like to cook now I love it got that so now you're gonna take that vanilla and do a teaspoon of that let's see if I can do it without spilling it everywhere can I do it tip this will hold it over the bowl oh right yeah goes into the bowl Tara even think about these things they're just like squirt a little more in there just just do a squirt well like this Oh squirt I like a little extra in there okay so now you're simply going to turn this on don't turn on high or it's gonna spray everywhere we'll just go to about two yeah and we're gonna just blend this up that smells so good the smokin oK we've got a little bit of this stuck on the bottom I'm gonna grab a spatula then kind of push that down so it gets down in there what does it smell like it's it isn't it smells like peanut butter cookies to me it sounds like some kind of candy what kind of maybe like peanut bud okay and that is what it should look like when it's all mixed I'll show the bowl here you can get this off that's picking out very well but that's what it looks like all right so what we're gonna do now is take our dough and we're gonna just form little balls out of it and I always end up making my cookies way bigger it seems like then other people do but just kind of roll your dough to a ball don't like that size and then you're going to roll it around in the sugar and then just place it on your cookie sheet then you're gonna take your fork or a fork kind of just crosshatch it whoops not like that like that that classic peanut butter shape there so go ahead and roll one of these this dough is really greasy too by the way so we like it like that's just how that is and of course we have Bella joining us over here I don't know if she's picking up her at all but she's hoping that you know she won't have snow see peanut butter cookies is gonna be coming her way like usual poor dog come on she been on a diet for a really long time not really working it's not really working no she's lost a little bit but she's not happy about it I hear you Bella okay so you want to try making the crosshatch on that one yeah so don't do what I did let's turn this looks for this closer so just gotta make that noise to arrest doesn't work maybe not so much pressure oh yeah a little too much pressure but that's okay okay see that one so we're gonna just keep making these and then we will be back when they are ready to go in the oven and as you can see there's no they do not stick at all I was gonna say you don't need to have a greased pan at all because there's so much oil in these we're grace from the peanut butter oh my goodness but you don't need it so we're going to stick these in our preheated oven at 350 and we're gonna pick them for it's supposed to be five to eight minutes but I always make my cookies like I said bigger so I'm not sure that it's gonna be five to eight minutes but we'll start at five minutes see where we're at I think it's gonna take quite a bit longer than that but we'll be back when these are done okay we cook these about nine minutes and we kind of like our cookies a little bit on the more underdone side I guess you would say so I think that's about where these are it's just a little bit underdone but I'm gonna let them cool and then I will have my daughter try one but if you want to cook them a little more thoroughly I would say probably another minute or two past what I did here so we're like 10 or 11 minutes for the size that we did here right here is what they look like okay so my daughter's got one of these we've got them all picked up and she's gonna try bite Oh what did you have Matt what do you think of your handiwork

be picked up of YouTube illegal in most states you", "8LyoH40k-WU": "what's going on everybody Tom North black Chiquito and welcome to another recipe video just for you subscribers out there and if you're not a subscriber yet please consider doing so now today we're going to continue our Aikido holiday treat section with some delicious Kido peanut butter cookies now this was requested to us from one of our good friends Kido Candace and she wanted a chewy Kido peanut butter cookie so I decided to take on the challenge and try to make it so that sounds good to you guys hang on tight let's get right into the recipe [Music] [Applause] all right everybody welcome to the recipe now we have all of the wet ingredients for our peanut butter cookies laid out here in front of us but I just want to quickly remind you guys that the macker and written recipe are going to be down in the description so check that out if you want those but first let's go through all of these wet ingredients one by one so right here I have half a cup or one stick of softened butter we have half a cup of crunchy peanut butter I do find it the crunchy stuff does work better than the smooth and you can usually find ones at the grocery store that literally the only ingredient is peanut butter and maybe sometimes some salt then we have one egg 1/3 cup of a yellows 1/2 cup packed of swerves brown sugar replacement this isn't erythritol base and then right here we have a quarter teaspoon of liquid stevia now you may be wondering why there's a lot of different sweeteners in this and one of the goals of this recipe was to have pretty much zero aftertaste from the different sweeteners we used so it did require a balancing of multiple sweeteners to achieve that so that's really what we're doing there no we're gonna going to add everything this bowl and get it all mixed up with an electric whisk you can do this with a stand mixer but for me it's kind of hard to film that so I'm just gonna use a hand mixer for this so let's get going on that add our peanut butter in there the a yellows brown sugar replacement our stevia and then finally one egg and then we're gonna give this a mix with our electric mixer now that this is all well combined we're gonna go ahead and set it aside when we work on our dry ingredients all right guys I have reset here and here are all of our dry ingredients so in this bowl I have one in three-quarters cup of fine almond flour make sure you've broken up all the clumps you can either use your whisk to do that or sometimes I just like to toss it in a food processor real quick in this little container I have half a teaspoon of pink salt now this really depends on the saltiness of your peanut butter if it's a salty peanut butter go and use 1/4 teaspoon then we have our leavening agents here so we have a half a teaspoon of baking soda and one teaspoon of baking powder in the back here we have 1 teaspoon of xanthan gum and 1 teaspoon of beef gelatin and I'm not really sure where I picked up this trick but I've known about it for quite a while but adding a little bit of gelatin to these cookies will make them chewy which was one of the goals of this cookie so you can use any gelatin you want I just prefer beef gelatin because you know the source of it so now we're gonna put all this into our bowl here with the almond flour and give it a nice whisky so starting off with our salt we got our baking powder baking soda the beef gelatin and our xanthan gum there we go give this a wix with just a hand whisk is probably fine for this just make sure it's pretty well combined that way you're loving agents and your binding agents are distributed evenly within the almond flour so now we have our wet ingredients here and our dry ingredients here and we're gonna add them together adding the drys to the wet sand about a third of it at a time so we'll get about a third of that in there mix it in and then do the remaining now we're gonna add our final third and get this all well combined if you see stuff sticking to the edges make sure you scrape it with that rubber scraper so now here we go we have our peanut butter cookie dough now go ahead and pop this in your refrigerator while you pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit alright everybody our oven is at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and it's come up to temperature so now it's time to start making our cookies now this wasn't the refrigerator the whole time and you want that dough to be a little bit firmer which is why we do that now the entirety of this dough weighs 24 ounces so that's going to give us 12 to ounce cookies so I got my scale set up here and I'm just going to weigh out 2 ounce balls that's a little bit over so we'll go and remove some 2 ounces on the dot perfect and I figure you could probably get about 6 of these on an average sheet here so I'll get those laid out alright everybody we have our six balls for the dealer cookie sheet so what I do one at a time is I'm gonna go ahead and try to roll them into a pretty good ball then I try to flatten the mountain to probably about I don't know about half an inch thick discs like so pop them down and move on to the next one we'll add that nice a kind of crosshatch pattern here in just a second alright everybody we have our pucks now and to add that signature kind of cross pattern that you have on peanut butter cookies you really just need a fork so we're gonna head and push it down and you're gonna flatten the cookie just a little bit to kind of make that pattern and you're gonna go both directions and that's all there is to it so I'm gonna finish these up and then I'll catch up with you right before we put them in the oven and explain that whole process alright everybody we have our finished cookies right here complete with the signature cross on there now these are going to go in a 350 degree fahrenheit oven for between 10 and 12 minutes now this is a little bit lower baking temperature than you would normally bake cookies that for slightly longer than you would the reason for this is because we don't want the bottoms to get too Brown and kind of get that burnt almond flour taste so 350 for 11 minutes is like perfect in my oven so just keep an eye on them and make sure the bottoms don't get too dark so I'm gonna pop these in the oven for 11 minutes and I'll catch up with you and explain the post baking process alright everybody our first batch of cookies is now out of the oven and you can tell they look absolutely delicious so your first instinct that's probably gonna be to just grab one off the tray and munch it down right unfortunately no we cannot do that as with most keto baked goods they need to cool down before they're stable enough to move or eat so give them 10 minutes before you transfer them to a cooling rack or 20 to 30 until you can eat them but since we have the dough remaining for another 6 cookies go ahead and grab yourself another baking sheet and go and do the same thing get the cookies prepped on here bake it on your top rack for 11 minutes and I'll catch up with you once all of our cookies are baked alright everybody here are all of the baked cookies just hanging on my drying rack right now and I'm gonna wait until they're fully cool to do the taste test but in the meantime why don't you check out the finished product and now let's get right into the taste test well now that you guys have seen the recipe and the finished product we are here for the taste test so I'm gonna grab one of these awesome looking cookies here off my little tray and there were a few goals with this recipe we wanted them to taste like real peanut butter cookies be nice and chewy and not really have any sugary aftertaste so that is exactly we're gonna be checking point four here so if we go ahead look at the cookies they actually hold together really well when you break them you can obviously tell that they're gonna have some chew to it so with that it's time to eat it well guys now it's time to answer the million dollar question did we hit all of those goals now first things first did they taste the Campina butter cookie guys this is a delicious peanut butter cookie it's a little bit sweet you get that real nice peanut butter flavor and you get a little bit of saltiness in the end from that salta we threw in there which I think encompasses a very delicious peanut butter cookie is it chewy well guys because that gelatin that we put in there it actually creates a really chewy texture for their cookies which i think is fantastic and I would we hit that one right on the head and when I let Candace sample some she agreed that the texture was perfect and lastly the sweetness did we have any real aftertaste from the sweeteners well we decided to balance it really well we use a little bit of a retort all a little bit of a yellows a little bit of stevia so we were able to keep the quantity low enough that we don't really have to deal with the AFT ASIS of any of them so I think we can check that box off too so I would objectively call these the best keto peanut butter cookies you could possibly make and I think you guys will agree so go ahead and give a try if you haven't yet the recipe and macros are gonna be out of the description if you like this video leave it a like if you have any questions or comments leave them down the comment section and if you have not subscribed yet do me a huge favor guys hit that subscribe button show some love and I will see you in the next one", "wwIT3POSo64": "today we're going to do a really fun one I'm going to show you how to make some classic peanut butter cookies so let's get on with the ingredients one and a half cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar 1/3 of a cup of vegetable shortening 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter 1/2 a cup of brown sugar 1 egg 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and our last ingredient 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract so those are the ingredients so let's get started and a recipe note if you don't want to use vegetable shortening you can use butter instead to start off my recipe I've placed my large egg into my bowl to that I'm going to add all of my white granulated sugar and then all of my brown sugar and whenever you're measuring out brown sugar you want to make sure that you pack your sugar into your measuring cup and that gives you a an accurate measurement get all that in there and all the ingredients that you see me using today I weighed them all out so they're accurate to one gram so if you weigh out your ingredients you should have exactly the same results that you see me getting in my recipe today to that we're going to add in our vegetable shortening and if you don't want to use vegetable shortening you can use butter instead I'm going to then grab my hand mixer and I just want to start mixing all of this together so very very slowly and it's at this point where you really want to mix this will so we want to get all of this cream together this is very very important either if you're making cookies or if you're making cakes a very very important step so I'm going to increase my mixer now so you want to get a little bit more speed a little bit more air and the faster your mixer goes the faster you can get the process done spoil my mixer down now I'm gonna add in my vanilla and I am using pure vanilla extract in this recipe okay that's good and then I'm going to add in all of our peanut butter and I am just using regular peanut butter so there are no nuts in it it's a smooth peanut butter when you are getting things out of your bowl make sure that you use a spatula so that you can get everything out that's good grab the mixer one more time and get all of that mixed in okay that looks good and now we will sift in our last ingredients so we have our all-purpose flour baking powder and our salt now if you're going to use butter instead you're going to want to use unsalted butter if you are adding that little bit of salt if you don't want to add extra salt use salted butter so that's good like that grab my mixer one last time speed number one we don't want a dust cloud and I just want to slowly start incorporating everything together now if you start mixing this for quite a while and it doesn't come together what you can do is just add a little bit of water so just get yourself a little tablespoon and just add a little bit until it starts coming together okay that looks good clean off my beaters and I'll show you if I take this the dough does look dry but when you squeeze it together you can see that it's coming together very very nicely so that's exactly what I want just like that so now we're ready to scoop our cookies onto the pan I'll set up and I'll be back in one second what I have here is a baking pan just with a little silicone mat and if you don't have that you can use parchment paper or you can just do it directly on a non-stick baking pan I'm just going to grab some of this with a little cookie scoop so I'm just pushing it against the side of the bowl just to compress it that ensures that you're going to have equal size cookies so just get in there and just push I do want a little bit of space in between them I think that looks good like that okay and then this this dough smells really good so that I'm just going to get all these done and then I'll come back in a second so just push compress and then a nice space in between your cookies and I do have my oven by the way set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and that has been preheated I started the oven about half an hour ago so it is all ready to go then our last one just going to take the back of a fork just give a little press so you can do a little crisscross that you usually see on a peanut butter cookie just like that there we have it so now I'm going to pop these into my 350 degree fahrenheit oven I'll be back in a little while so here is our first batch so I baked these for exactly 12 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm just going to let these cool down for about 10 minutes and then I'm going to move them over to a cooling rack over here and then I will do the rest of my batter and then we'll come back and we'll finish off our video but you smell really really good so there is our last one a total of 29 cookies so I'm just going to let these completely cool the last little batch and then I'm going to be back so here we are at the end of another video I hope you enjoyed this video these cookies are really amazing I hope you try them out so I'm just going to grab one and I'm just going to show you how nice these are look at this oh this recipe is amazing you have to try it I'm just going to go in for a

everybody's happy we have all the things we need here i have two cups of all-purpose flour i have a half a cup of packed brown sugar i have a half a cup of granulated sugar and a half a cup of peanut butter powder this is found right where the peanut butter is found in your grocery store um it's just freeze-dried peanut butter powder and it a lot of people like we use it for um protein shakes and different things but i thought we could totally use this in a peanut butter cookie mix we're also gonna use a teaspoon of salt a teaspoon of baking soda and a half a teaspoon of baking powder and then of course if you want them to be able to make the blossoms you're going to need to include the chocolate kisses and you're going to need some ribbon a quart sized mason jar and your printable tags and there will be a link down below to the recipe and the printable tags will also be included in that download and now we're going to go ahead and build our jar the first thing we have to do is take our flour and we're going to mix our leavening which is the baking powder and baking soda and we're going to mix the salt in there as well give this a bit of a whisk and now you're just going to put the flour mixture in the bottom of your one quart jar just like always we're going to go ahead and tap tap tap on the counter until we level everything out and everything is nice and compacted in there okay next up is peanut butter powder we're just gonna pop that right in there and then i'm going to get my my tart tamper in here and i'm going to tamp this down really well the peanut butter powder also likes to stick to the side of the jar so you might want to get a little spatula and go ahead and just remove it from the sides now we're going to go in with our granulated sugar again leveling that out and our brown sugar which is packed brown sugar and we're going to go ahead and give this a tamp down as well and that is all that is required here however if you like you can actually fill this void in your jar with some of these kisses and there you have it that is peanut butter cookie mix in a jar if you don't want to use chocolate kisses you can use m m's or reese's pieces or just chocolate chips you could use those mini peanut butter cups they actually have in the baking aisle they're unwrapped and they're ready to go so it's up to you now all we have to do is decorate up our jar and then you can give this you can tie the the chocolate kisses onto the jar if you'd like or you can just put this in a cute little gift bag and everybody is just gonna love this gift i just know

Today, I'm going to\nshow you how to make peanut butter blossoms. Oh, yeah. For those of you who are \nfamiliar with my show, you know, I love peanut butter \nand I love chocolate and I love cookies for those of you who \nare new to my show. I love peanut butter. I love chocolate and \nI love cookies. These peanut butter blossoms \nare super easy to make. If I can do it, you can do it. Before I move on, make sure to \nsubscribe to my channel and hit that notification bell so you \nwon't miss out on any of my new videos. Let's get back down below. In the description box, \nyou'll find the list of the ingredients and their amounts. First, we will start with one \nhalf cup of soft and unsalted butter. You could use salted butter \nif you want. Just reduce the amount of extra \nsalt that we add. And then I want to add the one \nof the stars of this dish. Three fourths cups \nof peanut butter. But that in there and then we want to beat \nthese together, so we just gonna use a hand mixer here or \nyou just use your wooden spoon or a whisk. All right, fantastic. I'm going to add in one \nlarge egg, one teaspoon of vanilla extract, and we'll \nmix those together. Perfect, and then we'll come in \nhere with one half cup of light brown sugar, one third cup of white \ngranulated sugar, if you don't have brown sugar, then you can \nuse all granulated sugar. All right, we've come\nin here and throughout this whole process, you'll be \nscraping the sides of the ball when needed just to\nmake sure everything gets blended in properly. Awesome. So we have all of that blended \nin and now we want to put in our dry ingredients and I have \na sister here, you don't need to use a sifter. You could just put your dry \ningredients in a bowl and whisk them together. Just putting my All-Purpose \nflour in this one and a half cups, one teaspoon, \none half teaspoon of salt. And one teaspoon of \nbaking soda. And then I normally just do \nhalf of it first. And they come\nin here and they. Scrape the sides, all right, \nwith the rest of this in here. And a little bit in this bull. And then we'll mix it up. The. Just kind of bring \nit all together. We'll give it one last mix on. All right, that's good enough \njust to tell us all combined we can remove these Beta's. And reserve resist the urge to \neat the cookie dough because the raw egg or don't resist and \neat some of it up to you. I'm not going to say nothing. I may or may not\nstill eat raw cookie dough. And I'm not going to lie when I \nwas a little kid, that was one of my favorite things to\ndo is eat raw cookie dough. And then I just want\nto bring it all together. And then I'm going to cover \nthis and in it in the refrigerator for about \nan hour. Also, I'm going to take \nmy Hershey Kisses. I have about 24 of them here. And then I'm going to put these \nin a refrigerator as well and chill them along with \nthe dough. After the dough has chilled, \npreheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 Celsius. And then I have \na tablespoon here. I'm going to come in and get \nsome dough and we want to roll it with clean hands into a ball \nand then come in here to sugar and dip it in the sugar and place it on a cookie sheet \nlined with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Let's do that. And space them about two inches \napart and then we bake these in the oven again, \n375 Fahrenheit, 190 Celsius for eight to 10 minutes, \nand they're going to get slightly cracked on the top and \nthey'll be slightly golden brown on the edges \nonto that step. And when they come out of \nthe oven, they'll look something like this. They'll still be mounded \nslightly golden brown on the top and on the edges a \nlittle bit, and they'll be cracked a little bit. And then we take\nthe cold with our hands. Just push it down. And then it will\ncrack even more the cookie. And this gives us the classic \nlook that we are going for. And I'm going to just let them \nsit here on the pan for about five minutes and then transfer \nthem to a wire rack to cool completely, and this \nrecipe makes about 24 of these peanut butter blossom cookies \nand after they've called him, bite into him. I'm going to take this \none right here. Oh, yeah. So awesome. All right, the peanut butter \nblossoms are done, turned out fantastic, \nreally easy to do. If I can do it, you can do it. I'm Matt Taylor. This has been another episode \nof In the Kitchen with Matt. Thank you for\njoining me, as always.

chunky peanut butter or add some little mini chocolate chips but today we're just going classic if your fork is sticking when you're trying to do the crisscross you can always dip it in the loops like

wearing camo which is guys no camo is my favorite color and I know people gonna comment Campbell's not a color I know it's a pattern same thing basically so today we are making cookies which you guys knows up here food and we're not speaking any cookies we're making cookies that technically only use four ingredients I like to top them with some chocolate and chopped up peanuts so kind of it's like six ingredients but let's just call them four ingredients because if you want to make the base cookie there's only four very easy to do so let's just start mixing it right over here I have some of this peanut butter which is the main ingredient we are making peanut butter cookies they're naturally gluten-free so my mom can eat them or if any of you are gluten-free they're perfect for you there's no need to use like any type of fake flour I like to use chunky peanut butter I think gives it like a nice crunch but you can also you smooth if that's what you have so let's just add our peanut butter straight into our Bowl there we go and now also I'm going to add in some sugar so we about 1 cup of peanut butter and 3/4 a cup of sugar straight into here so now we're gonna add in a little bit of vanilla extract for some more flavor enhancing and our fourth ingredient is a egg or an egg would be correct English alright so let's just make this up and now this cookies have cookie I make when I am in the mood for some type of cookies like sweet but I don't want to like go through the hassle of softening butter and all of that I just want something quick and easy that then my mom could also eat cuz as I mentioned my mom's good free so it's kind of just like perfect for all of us so let's just mix this all together alright so our cookie dough is now done being made so I'm going to form this into balls of about two tablespoons worth and we're gonna put this on to our parchment paper lined baking sheet now these cookies don't really spit out that much when we bake them they don't have any like leavening agent in them so you kind of put them around three in each row you don't really need to give them that much space in between and the last one alright so now we're gonna do is just take any old type of fork and press it down like that lift it up and then press it down on the other side to make this little design on top of the cookies and you're gonna want to repeat that with the rest of the cookies all right there we go and now finally I'm just gonna top them off with a little sprinkle each of some flaky sea salt and I feel like this doesn't really count as an ingredient it's like everyone has some salt on their house speeding up flaky sea salt you could just use a little bit of kosher salt or whatever you have or you can just leave it out I just like the actual touch of saltiness now I'm gonna go grab this pop it into the oven at about 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 to 12 minutes until they are nicely cooked we're gonna then dip them in some chocolate top them with some peanuts and it's gonna be absolutely delicious all right so our cookies came out of the oven and look at that with just those simple ingredients we have these absolutely delicious cookies right over here now we're gonna make them even better by coating them in some chocolate and topping it with some peanut so right over here I just have some melted chocolate and the way you want to do this to make them look great is coat about half of the cookie top half in the chocolate go place it back on the cookie sheet take some of these peanuts that I just chopped up and sprinkle them on top this makes them look better and taste better because I mean who doesn't love some chocolate so I do now I'm just going to coat the rest of them I'm gonna do about half of them coated and half of them plain alright so I just coded four of our cookies rest on relief plane and those have to harden up so I'm just gonna go in for a plain cookie because they're actually delicious just plain so let's just crack right into that look at that delicious cookie Center and just delicious okay I cannot wait to take it let's just go hmm Wow it is seriously incredible what you're able to do with such few ingredients in such a short amount of time totally is the perfect thing for a busy weeknight feeding some cookies last minute you're having those cookie cravings that I get all the

and technical difficulties and the universe trying to implode in on itself I'm back in the kitchen rustling up some sweet treats and since we're at the tail end of the year it's time to get into some Christmas fun now normally every year I do sort of more or less traditional Christmas recipes but I thought this year for a change I go the non-traditional path and I'm going to start out with these fabulous cookies now they're not really Christmassy per se but I've noticed over the years that the traditional Christmas treats that we serve every year don't necessarily appeal to kids things like fruit mince pies and brandy butter and all that sort of stuff most of the kids kind of turn their nose up so I thought why not do something that the kids will actually enjoy so I took flavors from a favorite childhood tree and turned them into something that would be great for a Christmas party or is an edible gift let's make these beautiful PB&J cookies on the one pot chef [Music] first things first into a large mixing bowl I've got 100 grams of butter at room temperature it's nice and soft and squishy so it's easy to beat I'm using unsalted butter today mainly because when you do a dessert it's best to not use regular butter because it can be a bit too salty so the unsalted butter is really good for this but in a pinch regular butter will be fine to that I'm gonna add in three-quarters of a cup of good-quality peanut butter you can use smooth or crunchy depending on your personal taste but with peanut butter you have to be careful when it comes to baking because a good-quality peanut butter shouldn't be too oily it shouldn't be too dry you can see that's a really nice one it's smooth but it's not really wet this one is great if you're using something that's got a lot of oil in it it's kind of difficult to use in baking because it can change the consistency of the cookie dough particularly in this one so I recommend doing a bit of research finding a good quality peanut butter and you'll have fabulous cookies so get that peanut butter in the bowl I'm also adding in half a cup of castor sugar or superfine white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar now brown sugar is great in these cookies because it adds that little bit of extra sort of caramely molasses II flavor it really helps to change the color of the cookies gives them a bit of a brown quality to them make some extra tasting and I'm also adding in a teaspoon of vanilla extract and just using an electric hammock so we're just going to beat the butter peanut butter sugars and vanilla together until it's light and fluffy and smooth beating butter and sugar together is known as creaming it together and if you want to know if you've done it properly there's a very simple test it's called the pinch test you take your finger and your thumb and you just take a small amount of the mixture and you just hold it between your fingers like that and just rub and if it feels gritty from the sugar then you know it needs a little bit more beating that feels pretty good so let's move on we're gonna add in one egg and then just beat that in next I've got one and a quarter cups of plain all-purpose flour and I've added one teaspoon of baking powder and all we're gonna do is we're just going to sift that into the bowl then just using a spatula we're just going to mix everything together until combined there that's looking good now this is a really soft cookie dough at the moment it's gonna be a bit difficult for us to roll it into balls so what we're gonna do is we're gonna cover this with some cling wrap and we're gonna pop it into the fridge for about half an hour to chill once the cookie dough has chilled we're just going to take tablespoonfuls of the mixture and then using your hands just roll them into balls like so yeah that looks good and place them onto a baking tray lined with some non-stick baking paper I had enough cookie dough to make 24 balls so what I'm gonna do now is just using a clean thumb just make a little indentation in the center just like so like that make sure you form it up if there's any cracks and just do that to each of the balls once you put your thumb prints into each of the cookie balls all we need to do is fill them up with jam now you can use whatever jam or jelly you prefer I'm using raspberry jam today because I've happened to have someone there and it's a good thing and just spoon a small amount of jam into each of the holes making sure you don't overfill it too much you probably want to put about 1/4 of a teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon per hole but basically just use your best judgment on this one once they've all been filled with jam all we have to do is pop these into the oven preheated oven 160 degrees Celsius about 320 degrees Fahrenheit and we're gonna bake them for about 12 to 15 minutes or until they are nice and golden around the edges while our cookies are baking in the oven I thought I'd take this opportunity remind you to check out my social media Facebook Twitter and Instagram links in the video description underneath this video on YouTube and speaking of YouTube don't forget to subscribe to my channel click the subscribe button and the notification bell next to it that way you won't miss out on any of my new videos once out of the oven we're just going to allow the cookies to cool completely on the trays now you'll notice that they're still quite soft when they first come out of the oven that's perfectly fine they're gonna firm up as they cool now a little word of warning when you're working with jam in the oven you have to be very very very careful because superheated sugar plus skin equals re so do not try to eat these as soon as they come out of the oven you need to let them cool completely before you try to eat them or even touch them because you can get a really bad burn from superheated jam so just leave them alone and they will come home and wagging their tails behind them I lost my train of thought yet don't touch naughty bad let them cool and here we have our completed PB&J cookies looking absolutely amazing the whole kitchen smells like warm peanut butter it's absolutely amazing now these are not only great for Christmas parties or for the snack table on the big day itself these also make a great edible gift you can pack half a dozen of these up in a little cellophane bag and they make a great edible gift for your friends and family I wish you could smell this through the screen I swear these are absolutely incredible oh ok time to dive in and have a taste mmm-hmm the cookies themselves are sweet and buttery they're lightly crisp light a little bit chewy a little bit crumbly on the inside and they've got a lovely buttery flavor in the background but you can definitely taste the peanut butter to them and a little bit of vanilla to them as well and that Jam and that beautiful raspberry jam on top is absolutely sensational takes this to the next level and you are going to absolutely love these well I hope you enjoyed this recipe check out my other videos at one-pot chef show comm and until next time ho ho ho these cookies are really easy to make I made 24 of them with this recipe so that's quite a big batch you could easily double or even triple the batch amount if you wanted to if you're looking to make a whole bunch of them for gifts or if you're doing a really big party but what you definitely want to do is make sure they're completely cool before you start eating them and before you pack them up put them into an airtight container and they will be fine for up to a week now they don't generally last a week in my house because they are so yummy they usually go within the first day so maybe making an extra batch is probably a good idea", "jEROQ6_BNVU": "when I was growing up my school lunch on Friday was pizza and peanut butter cookie the peanut butter cookie was my absolute favorite part and today I'm making I guess what I would call an approximation of that recipe it's so simple iwase together with one cup of flour 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda and then in my mixer I have a stick of butter softened or room-temperature to that add 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar as well as a half a cup of brown sugar then 3/4 of a cup of smooth peanut butter cream those together you need one large egg and I have a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract then add your dry ingredients you can add the ball at once turn it on low that's all there is to it to a peanut butter cookie guys if you can believe it smells like Friday's at school and then scoop your cookies about two tablespoons at a time onto your baking sheets you can put about three across on a standard baking sheet I'm always so tempted to just go ahead and eat the dough which I do sometimes I know you're not supposed to because of the raw egg but taking my life into my own hands you guys Oh see that piece got to eat that then if you want to get that classic crosshatch pattern you can dip the tines of a fork just lightly in water just to moisten them a little bit and if they get too sticky and then just press the tines of the fork in one on cross voila well that's it get these guys into a 350 degree oven you want to bake them until they're firm and set and just lightly golden around the edges 18 to 20 minutes and that is your cooled cookie ready to eat let's see does it take me back oh my god I totally take me back it's like a little bit chewy a little bit crispy and so fantastic I feel like I'm 16 again you you", "Gd36IN5aXCs": "Hey everyone, it's Sam from SugarSpunRun.com and today I'll be showing you how to make peanut butter chocolate chunk cookies. I have shared so many different peanut butter cookie recipes over on the blog, from classic peanut butter blossoms to peanut butter stuffed\nchocolate cookies, but today's peanut butter chocolate\nchunk cookies might actually be my favorite. They are so soft, and buttery,\nand peanut buttery, and then we're throwing a bunch of chocolate into the\nmix. What could be better? This recipe is also very simple so let's get right to\nit. The first thing you're going to need is\na large bowl. To this bowl, we are going to add 10 tablespoons of softened\nunsalted butter. Now, we'll add 2/3 cup of tightly packed\nlight or dark brown sugar in with our butter. I love using brown sugar in my\ncookies. It really gives them a great flavor, but it also helps make them nice and soft and chewy. Then we'll add a quarter\ncup of granulated sugar. Today we are using 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter.\nNow I don't recommend using a natural peanut butter for this. You don't want to\nuse the kind that separates, and has the oil on top. Just use a generic or classic\nregular peanut butter. You want to use your spatula make sure we get all of\nthat in there. You don't want to leave any of that peanut butter behind. At this\npoint you are going to need an electric mixer. I'm just using a hand mixer, but\nyou can always use a stand mixer instead for this recipe, and I'm just going to cream together everything until it's completely combined. We'll add one large egg and one large egg yolk into our batter. Now this extra yolk is really important it helps make the cookies soft and tender. As you've probably figured out,\nI'm all about soft chewy cookies. So keep that yolk in there it's worth it. We'll\nalso add just a half teaspoon of vanilla extract for flavor. Even though we have\nplenty of that peanut butter flavor in there already. Guys it already smells so good in my kitchen. We're just going to stir everything together until it's creamy and well combined. Our batter is looking pretty good right\nabout now, so we're actually going to set this aside, and we're now going to\nneed a separate bowl for our dry ingredients. You'll just need a\nmedium-sized bowl and we're going to add one and a half cups of all-purpose flour to this bowl. To the flour we're going to add one tablespoon of corn starch. Now, if you're in the UK you'll know it as corn flour instead. I love using corn starch\nin my cookies. It's another ingredient that helps facilitate soft chewy cookies.\nIt helps give them some structure without needing to add flour, which can\ndry them out. It's a really great secret ingredient for most of my cookies. We'll also add 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Give everything a good stir. Once you've combined all your dry ingredients, we're going to bring back our peanut butter mixture from earlier. We're just going to gradually combine the dry ingredients and wet ingredients together. You can go back to using your electric mixer if you prefer. I'm just going to use my spatula. If the\ndough gets too stiff, I'll switch back over to my electric mixer. Now I like to\ndo this gradually in about two, or three, or even four parts, just because it makes\nit easier to combine everything. So once our dough is nicely mixed together, and\neverything's combined. We can move on to possibly the most important part of this\nwhole recipe, and that is the chocolate chunks. You will need 8 ounces of chopped\nchocolate for this recipe. You can use milk chocolate, or semi-sweet, whatever\nyou prefer. I'm actually using 4 chopped Hershey bars. I love that milk chocolate\nand peanut butter to go together really well. I'm actually going to reserve just\na little bit of that chocolate, because if you've seen in my other cookie\nrecipes, once they come out of the oven I'm going to nestle a few of them on top\nof the cookies. It's going to help make them look nice and pretty. It's\noptional you can stir it all into the dough, but I'm gonna reserve a little bit. Our cookie dough is going to be really\nsoft at this point. It's actually too soft to roll. So it's going to need to be chilled. We're going to just cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap. Your peanut butter chocolate chunk cookie dough is going to need to go into the refrigerator for at least 30 to 60 minutes before we can proceed. It can be\nchilled overnight if you prefer. If you want to make it a day in advance,\nmake sure you chill it before you try to roll the dough. Otherwise it's going to be too sticky and it'll spread all over your oven and it'll spread all over your oven so\nabout 15 minutes before your dough is So about 15 minutes before your dough is finished chilling and you're ready to bake you're going to want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Once\nyour dough is finished chilling, we can go ahead and grab that from the fridge\nand we're ready to scoop it. I'm going to be using a 1 and 1/2 tablespoon size\ncookie dough scoop to scoop my dough. I'll leave a link to this exact one in\nthe description, but you don't have to use this. You can just use a spoon that'll be fine too. Now you could just drop your cookie dough by the spoonful like this onto your baking sheet, but because I like mine to look nice and\nround and uniform, I'm just going to lightly roll them between my palms to\nmake the cookie dough ball nice and round. Our cookie dough is now ready to\nbake so we'll transfer this to our 350 degrees Fahrenheit preheated oven where\nthe cookies will bake for about 12 minutes. Now as soon as these cookies\ncome out of the oven, remember those chocolate pieces that I\nreserved from earlier, if you also reserved any, within one minute of the\ncookies coming out of the oven you're going to want to gently press additional\nchocolate pieces on to the top of each cookie. And that is how you make my super\nsoft and chewy peanut butter chocolate chunk cookies. I really think you guys\nare gonna love this one. If you try it out please let me know what you think.

Welcome\nto tasty Tuesdays where I upload a new video every Tuesday. I thank you so much for tuning in. Today we're going to be\nmaking peanut butter cookies, which was highly requested\nfrom my Facebook page. So thank you so much,\nfriends, for requesting peanut butter cookies. So stay tuned to learn how to make your own, delicious, delightful peanut butter cookies. You're gonna add a half\ncup of granulated sugar, in to a bowl. And then\nyou're going to pack on a half cup of brown sugar. So you're gonna pack on that brown sugar make sure it's a half cup\nand drop it down in the bowl. And then you're gonna get a\nhalf cup of peanut butter. And place that down. And add a fourth cup of shortening. And a fourth cup of softened margerine, and I just softened the margerine in a microwave for about 10 to 15 seconds and it softens up. Then you add one egg. Then you're gonna mix everything together, Then you're gonna add\none and a fourth cup of all purpose flour. Add\nthree quarter teaspoon of baking soda. Then add half a teaspoon of baking powder. And mix everything together. So after stirring completely,\nit should look like this. Cover it up with plastic wrap, or foil if you have that. Place it in the refrigerator for two hours to harden. So two hours has passed, and my peanut butter cookie\ndough is looking really firm. So you're just going to\nwant to preheat your oven to 375 degrees and let's\ngo ahead and roll these in to one inch balls. Okay,\nso grab a cookie sheet, and then place parchment\npaper on top of the cookie sheet. You don't\nhave to grease your pan for peanut butter cookies. Just grab about one inch balls, or make one inch balls. And, roll them like this. And place them on your\nsheet, your cookie sheet. And then I like using a fork, and I'm going to make like a criss-cross motion like\nthis and repeat the process. So once you finish rolling\nyour dough in to balls, and then putting the fork impressions, you're ready to bake\nif your oven is already preheated to 375 degrees. Bake your cookies for\nabout nine to ten minutes and you're ready to enjoy. Okay, so the cookies\nready, it's been about nine to ten minutes and\nthey're a little bit golden brown, which is perfect. You're gonna just let\nyour cookies cool off for five minutes and then\nyou're gonna transfer them on to a wire rack. So after your cookies have cooled for five minutes and it's not as\nsoft, you can actually place your cookies on a wire\nrack to cool even more. And you're ready to enjoy your cookies once they have cooled a little bit more. So my husband's going\nto be the taste tester, he's gonna try his very\nfirst peanut butter cookie that I just baked, so we'll see. - It smells so good. - You like it? - Oh my God. (laughing) - He loves peanut butter cookies, so - Oh my God, that is so good. - Yeah? - I'm not even joking. I know I say this about everything, but this is the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had in my entire life. (laughing) I swear. It is so, so good. All right. - My husband. - (mmmmm) That is so good! - So my husband loves it,\nand I hope you give it a try. So that was it. Peanut butter cookies. I hope you enjoy, thank\nyou so much for tuning in.

no chilling time required so whenever a peanut butter cookie craving strikes you can just whip up the dough throw it in the oven and you earn a business so the first thing we're gonna do is get our dry ingredients out of the way so I've got one and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour in my bowl here I'm gonna add 3/4 of a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon of sea salt and I'm just gonna whisk this together to combine to get my wet ingredients going I've got 1/2 cup of unsalted softened butter in my bowl here I'm gonna add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar and we're gonna cream this together until it's fluffy and combined next you're going to add in a half cup creamy peanut butter as well as one large egg and you're going to beat that in with a mixer now we're going to add in our dry ingredients that we mixed earlier and we're going to mix until it's almost combined and once the flower has almost disappeared in the dough that's when you want to add in two cups of peanut butter M&M you can stir in the M&Ms with a spatula now I'm gonna take a large cookie scoop and I'm gonna portion out small scoops of cookie dough onto a silicone mat you could use parchment paper as well so my cookies are all portioned out and if you don't want to eat all these right now what you can do is store these mounds in the freezer I'm just gonna put them on this baking tray and then I'm gonna cover it with a lid and then you can just place these cookie mounds directly in a cookie sheet and bake them whenever you'd like so I am just going to bake six right now and these are going to go into a 350 oven for about 15 minutes until the cookie start to brown on the edges and they flatten out a little bit once you take the cookies out of the oven you want to let them cool for about five minutes or so just for the cookies can set their shape so if you're looking for more cookie recipes I have a couple more videos that I recommend you watch I put the links in the screen above and if you're on your phone or tablet I also put the links in the description box below don't forget to subscribe just to make sure you don't miss out on any future video recipes thanks so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time look", "Jxwwv3gLEAw": "hi guys it's honey here welcome to my youtube channel today im gonna be demonstrating how to use this new product some of you probably seen it already online and I've seen a couple of tutorials and videos already and it's called doubt easy rolling mat system this is the actual mat that we'll be using its made out of silicone just to be weird idea how hard it is this is the size of the mat of course most most of the time you'll be working with it fold it like this so this is the actual size that you'll be working with this man came with a set of six rolling guides for are which are water inch thick and also these two are slightly thinner and I think these would be great for rolling out a pie dough if you were to make it buy it so today I'm gonna show you how to make peanut butter cookies let's get started to make the cookies you'll need creamy peanut butter room temperature butter I'm using unsalted butter one whole egg powdered sugar brown sugar and you also need some flour and a little bit of salt and don't forget vanilla extract first sift or steer flour with salt and set aside now crack one egg add one tablespoon of vanilla extract and whisk until combined now cream butter with brown sugar and powdered sugar start beating it on low and then increase the speed to medium-high you want to beat it until it's all all combined and creamy about a minute or so and then you can add peanut butter now gradually add egg mixture and now you're ready to add the flour so you want to lower the speed and then start adding the flour now we can turn this off I'm going to dump this into a bowl and then using your hands you want to knead it until it comes to a ball now flatten it a little bit form a disk and then wrap it in a plastic wrap you're going to have to chill this Bell overnight now we are ready to make the cookies so this is the peanut butter dough that we made it's firm to the touch and I'm just going to let it sit at room temperature for five to ten minutes until it softens up a little bit so I can roll it out today I'm going to use the pastry med and doll rolling system to make the cookies but you can also use it to make pies you can roll out graham cracker dough you can use it to make pasta Linzer cookies and also even pizza dough so it's really versatile what's great about it it's nonstick and you don't have to use as much flour you virtually are not using any flour when rolling out dough using this silicon mat which also helps with keeping your pastries and cookies really tender now here are their rolling guides so depending on how thick you want your cookie dough you can stack the rolling guides together this would create a half inch cookie dough or half inch cookies so this would be great for the cookie pops I generally use two Paynter sticks glued together and I have them wrapped in a clear plastic wrap so this is the thickness that I like for my decorated cookies and I wanted to see if I can get the same thickness using these new rolling guide so I stacked together 1/4 inch and 1/8 of an inch and as you see here they are pretty much the same so this is a great fitness for decorated cookies so that's what I'll be using today now as far as the placement of the rolling guys goes you can put them on top or you can also place them on your knife of your mat or you can put one underneath and one on the top so it really depends on what you prefer I like to have them both on the top so that's what I'll do today and now we are ready to roll out the cookies I'm going to use my favorite rolling pin which is an old-fashioned wooden rolling pin and I removed the handles I've tried other rolling pins but I always go back to this one I also like that it stores easily it's small enough to fit into my kitchen drawer so I like to use it a lot now I noticed that my rowing guy slided a little bit this can be fixed easily by wrapping them in plastic wrap or you can also put one rolling guide on top and one underneath the mat and a silicone will prevent that from happening at this point you can start cutting out the cookies but if you'd like to protect your silicone surface I would recommend that you put a piece of wax paper underneath your cookie dough and to do that we're going to flip the whole thing peanut butter dough tends to be pretty sticky and as you see here there is some residue but that's close to nothing so that's pretty normal I wouldn't worry about that and I'm just going to flip this again and then we'll have the wax paper underneath the dough and we can start cutting out the cookies now transfer the cookies onto your baking sheet lined with parchment paper now I'm going to put the cookies into the fridge and I'm going to chill them for about 15 minutes as far as the maintenance of this silicone mat goes you can clean it or wash it under running water in your sink I'm just going to wipe it clean and dry with paper towel and some white distilled vinegar before putting it away make sure that you dried thoroughly because you don't want to store the silicone mat damn over time this can cause some issues with mold development and things like that so before you store it dry it really well and then you can actually store it in the original packaging just roll it up and put it in the box if you'd like to get this doll rolling system follow the link down below in a description I included a link where you can get it online I really like working with this mat because it eliminates excessive use of flour it's flexible portable it's nonstick so your dough is not gonna stick to it it's really easy to clean it's freezer safe and it also saves you some money on parchment if you're using parchment to roll out the cookie dough and here are just few suggestions like you saw before the rolling guides were sliding so I decided to secure them using plastic wrap you can also do this by putting one rolling guide on top of the silicone mat and wonder underneath and a silicone mat will keep them in place that's another option you have I also decided to skip one step by placing the wax paper underneath my cookie dough right from the beginning and now I'm ready to make more cookies now we are ready to bake the cookies I'm going to bake them for about 9 to 10 minutes depending on the size of the cookies once baked they're gonna be puffy in the center oops I messed up one cookie but that's okay I'm gonna eat it later you wanna let these cool and then you can transfer them onto a cooling rack now when you are planning on decorating these I would recommend that you let them rest for about a day or so I feel like they firm up a little bit in a day so they are easier to handle I hope you'll give this recipe a try let me know what you think down below in a comment section thanks for watching guys and I'll see you next time", "a3J7emEbTBE": "today's recipe comes by request pixie-dust traveler who is a fellow youtuber and i will try to remember to link her in the description box below and pixie dust if I forget don't hesitate to comment and remind me but she had requested a recipe demonstration or a recipe video for peanut butter cookies and so I hadn't made them before so I've started researching different peanut butter cookie recipes and and seeing what different elements I would bring together and so I made a batch of peanut butter cookies and it's rare that something works so great on the very first try but my husband tasted these and he said don't change a thing they're absolutely perfect so that's what we're making today now to start out I am going to make my own homemade peanut butter our done a video on this previously but it's really simple all you need is a good food processor I'll say good I don't think I've spent more than $40 on this but a food processor you want unsalted roasted peanuts the reason I say unsalted because for some reason salted peanuts come with a lot of extra ingredients so the only ingredients in this is peanuts so I will add my own salt as I am making the peanut butter so again I'm just going to take a whole container and this is a container it's a 16 ounce container and I'm going to put the lid on here and I'm going to pulse this a few times to get it almost a powdery consistency and I'm gonna add some salt and then I'm gonna let it go until it creams up really good alright again that's just it's a like I said it's a kind of just a crumbly consistency there you don't want it you don't want it to start to butter yet when you're add your salt and I don't even measure this I mean it's probably I probably put close to a half tablespoon of salt in here maybe a little bit more and if you have enough salt in this you won't need to add any salt to the cookie dough recipe so salts in there I'm not gonna replace this and keep keep letting it go it actually takes a couple of minutes for the peanut bird came up and get good and creamy and so much so that the device actually starts to get a little bit warm but that's okay I said I probably I was saying good four to five minutes to get this going so I wouldn't take care of this and we'll be right back this just finished up and so let me show you just how creamy you can really get it at home so let's just look take a look right there I mean it's shiny it's creamy the reason you let it go so long you can stop it shorter in it and have more coarse peanut butter but the oils don't really start releasing until you have it going for a good four to five minutes and when you're making cookies or fudge do you really want a more creamy peanut butter than chunky so I'm gonna give this measured out and then we will get to the recipe what you have is you're gonna have 1 egg 1/2 a cup of swirl granulated sweetener 1/3 cup of soir brown sweetener a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then this is totally optional but I also put in a tablespoon of yacon syrup just because I really like the flavor boost that it gives to the cookies and then all you need as far as flour is you have two tablespoons of coconut flour and then you have 1 cup of creamy peanut butter I got to tell you once you start making your own homemade peanut butter you will never want to buy store-bought again it just it tastes so much better and you have full control over the amount of salt that's in there and then you can have a lot of fun and you can add in some sweeteners and different flavors of chocolate and you can really just make up a bunch of different varieties of peanut butter spreads that you could put on keto crackers or keto bread make a keto peanut butter and jelly sandwich with some coarse keto strawberry jam or strawberry season is coming up so I hope to have a strawberry jam recipe for you guys soon but we are on the cookie video today so let's get to making the cookies okay as I said 1 egg 1/2 cup is for sweetener 1/3 cup of swirl brown LeConte Oh brown monkford brown would also work and then a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then I don't cream measure the yacon syrup because this is a basically in molasses substitute for keto and it has the consistency of molasses and so it's very thick and so it's just best to measure that at the time of making the video so you want to mix this together with an electric hand mixer with the beater paddles and you want this to get very creamy and almost frothy and so you want to beat this on the medium speed medium to high for like three minutes okay so we'll come back I'll show show you what this looks like after it's good and probably care for this part this last little bit I'm gonna mix in the two tablespoons of coconut coconut flour first get that well incorporated and then finally I will add in the peanut butter and when it gets fully mixed up it's gonna look a little bit crumbly but that's okay because you're gonna be smashed me together with a cookie scoop and putting it on the pan to bake nice creamy peanut butter like I said if you don't if you don't want to make it at home you don't have to it just it really does taste better store-bought creamy will work just fine now of course before you bake it you can always do a little taste test to make sure it's right where Ike's weakness level for you my son was actually upset that we weren't leaving it as cookie dough and so you can do that if you don't want to bake them it really does taste really wonderful just as the cookie dough is as well you know of course some people are kind of raw egg adverse and does a raw egg in it I've never had a problem with it but Lena's cookie dough baking his cookies either way so let's go ahead we're gonna scoop these out on a pan using a one-inch cookie scoop I've got my baking sheet with parchment paper you can also use a silicone baking mat by your Gertie right now so I'm using parchment paper and then you just want to scoop these out now the interesting thing about peanut butter cookies is they're always made with the with the crisscross shape on top press with a fork and I don't know why so if you have any idea what the history is behind that I would love to know why peanut butter cookies traditionally have the crisscross shape this is going to make cookie dough you need this should make about 20 cookies so not not too much it's already huge about the cookie this kind of really is just a right amount to to make to satisfy your sweet tooth so this batch is uh it's - small cookie okay uh thanks of the do so we're not we're 19 cookies down all set to of obviously have a little more cookie to this area value on this I will get this figured out I will be linking undissociated or related blog post to this recipe in the description box and that blog post will have the the nutritional value so I want to get these any oven they need to bake in the oven for right about 12 minutes you want the edges just to start getting just golden brown you pull them out so just going to brown and set up and then we'll take a look at it when they come out well before they go in let me show you the my masterful crisscross pattern all right these are done they're out of the oven they look perfect they're just a little bit maybe maybe a little bit more brand on the edges than I prefer overall they look amazing so that's all there is to it this is a really easy easy cookie to make and with expecially a yacon syrup I'm a huge event keto or bacon keto for a while you probably have all the ingredients on hand but if not I'll make sure it linked to the specialty ingredients in the description box and it will also be on the post that is on my website so these are the oven they need to cool for 10 to 15 minutes and then I will transfer them to a cooling rack where they can finish cooling the rest of the way I've had these just sitting out on the counter in an airtight container I would say they probably last up to a week I don't know because it didn't actually last that long the main house I would say for sure you're good for three or four days they're just gonna be the longer net you might want to stick them in the fridge or you can even freeze them for up to three months so that's all I have for today if you have any recipe requests that you would like to see me make or put up on the web stop to make sure and let me know now see you on the next video", "532pLC4SwTM": "hey guys welcome back to our channel my name is Andrea with rudimentary adventures in food and I am here today with a retro peanut butter cookie recipe from this quick I love cookbooks and I collect them I have this vintage cookbook from the 1960s and I saw a peanut butter cookie recipe that I'd never seen before so I wanted to try it out with you guys today so you are going to need your Bisquick mix you're going to need some water you're gonna need some brown sugar some white sugar some peanut butter and then you're also going to need some butter or shortening now the original recipe called for shortening I don't have any shortening but I know that butter is a substitute for that so I have some butter right here and I will make sure to leave the recipe in the description box so if you want to see how these cookies turn out stay tuned until I have my bowl here and I am going to drop in my brown sugar and my white sugar my butter and my peanut butter [Music] and my water and now I'm going to add in my baking mix [Music] [Applause] [Music] so here is my dough all mixed up and it smells really really good I've got my pan right here so all I'm going to do is just roll up probably like an inch of cookie dough just like that there it is make little rounds and I've got my oven preheated to 350 degrees so I'm just going to do a few of these on camera and then I'll do the rest off-camera just do [Music] I'm just gonna drop it down and then what I do is I have a little bitty bowl of water and I have a fork and all I do is wet my fork so that it won't stick to the dough and I just do the traditional Criss crosses so I just go down down down and then I go across across just like that down down down and then across across [Music] just like that okay I'm gonna do the rest and then I will show you what they look like so I have one pan ready to go and then I've got another one almost ready to go the instructions say to pop these in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes so I am going to throw this in the oven and then I will show you what they look like when they come out so both batches of cookies are out of the oven I ended up baking these for 13 to 14 minutes each and as you can see there's cookies missing from each cookie sheet because Howard and I tried them that's my husband and we both really liked them a lot yes I don't usually like peanut butter cookie yeah he's not a peanut butter cookie person but these are really really good so Howard will you break one open so people can see what they look like so there they are it's a let me try to focus it's a very tender cookie and Howard's Dibley you like soft cookies and I'm into crunchy cookies and he's satisfied both of us they're not too soft they're not too crunchy and I definitely think this will be my go-to peanut butter cookie from here on out so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please make sure to give us a thumbs up we do recipes taste tests grocery hauls and what's for dinner and we'd love you to be part of our YouTube family thanks so much for watching and we'll see you guys next time", "GoynvsNDWWM": "today I'm going to be making these Pillsbury Reese's peanut butter cookie dough cookies they're made with real Reese's peanut butter they were 250 at Walmart and you you found them in the refrigerated section of the grocery store it says safe to eat raw and it makes 24 cookies you pre-heat your oven to 350 place cookie dough rounds about two inches apart on ungreased cookie sheet flatten and crisscross pattern bake for 10 to 14 minutes so since it says safe to eat raw I'm going to put one on a plate and keep this in the refrigerator while these are baking and that way when these come out Kevin and I can try it for you cooked and raw I think I like the idea of doing that so I'm just going to put these on my cookie sheet I'm using one of those Reynolds brand baking sheets and they're really nice the parchment sheets so I'm gonna put them all on here we'll see how far they spread there we go and you can see I'm missing one because I reserved the one let's do our crisscross pattern and making the peanut butter cookies in the role that you cut I normally have a plate like this of sugar and I'll take the fork and I'll dip it into the sugar and then and then make my press it down and then all dip it in the sugar again and then press it again but since it didn't tell me to do that that's why I'm not doing it I'm doing exactly like they said so but normally it just gives it it's easier to get your fork out of the dough when it has that sugar because you can see it it's tough a little bit on some of these but it's it makes it easier but it also adds those little crystallized sugar pieces to the top of your cookie too so I'm gonna get these in the oven I'll prep in a minute for 13 minutes and then we'll be back so this is how they look when they first come in at you can see they really didn't they expand it a little bit but not much so you can fit them all on one cookie sheet so you're supposed to let them cool for two minutes so we're gonna do that and then we'll be like to trauma so they are I didn't talk about calories it says it had they're safe to eat raw because they have heat treated flour and pasteurized eggs ready to eat manufacturing find out more visit us at Pillsbury comm forward slash safe to eat raw there are twelve servings per container - cookies 38 grams or 160 calories it says product can be frozen up to two months if placed in the freezer before they used by date printed on the package thaw before opening do not microwave the cookie dough I'd say it would pull into a puddle so do you want to try to cook during moreover raw I've never been a fan anymore cookie dough mm-hmm no he hasn't um well it tastes peanut butter I eat that so me that does not taste any different than the peanut butter that comes in the roll it's the regular it does not taste like Lisa no not racist it just tastes like their regular peanut butter cookie dough nobody like that here it is yeah here it is oh that's these are more expensive it's already yeah it probably is because they've made them for you that the tubes not ready right exactly even though we do anyway okay yeah I'm still tasting a bar I don't know how this brand anytime you've ever made the rolls I never think it tastes like a bar when I was making them I told you that I would put them in sugar and and crisscross them for a long time but what I've always done to make them better is I always have a bag of Hershey Kisses and when they come out of the oven push them out a little I put a Hershey kiss on each one that way you not only get a little bit of peanut butter flavor but you also get chocolate half-breed servants cooked oh yeah I prefer it cooked Bank baked in the oven I prefer this baked I like the texture better yeah you get a peanut butter flavor there really it is it's not strong yes I do get peanut butter but it's not strong peanut butter it's not like a strong chip peanut boat it's not even like the rhesus thing of errors you can buy Reese's peanut butter in a jar and it does not taste anything like this yeah if I'm a blonde Paula and you gave me that I would never said peanut butter I would but if I would never say Reese's peanut butter if you've ever bought just the regular peanut butter in the roll I'm telling you it's it's the same thing I think they've just put in a different package that's all I've done it's putting the Reese's package I don't think there was anything Reese's to do with it they just put that name on there because it gets your attention and it will make people buy it like I did so I'm telling you so that you know if you like that then that's great but don't expect I would hate for you to get these and expect it should be any more than what you already get from those because it is not it's the same it's the same exact flavor and if I bought these again I would still do the the kiss just because it does I had more flavor to it the basic cookies and if I did them again I would still do my sugar trick I think yeah I didn't do it this time because the directions didn't say to and we always try to follow the directions for our reviews because we figured they know best but I do think of just a little bit of sugar on top makes it it goes along lightning no hardly use it yeah so I hope this helps you out I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "qZaHB0yepEQ": "cookies okay who doesn't love them they are my favorite thing to serve with my other favorite thing which is tea now these cookies have only five ingredients there's a really crunchy biscuit base with a smooth creamy filling and they'll take you less than 15 minutes so let's get started what we're gonna start with first is our protein we're gonna have two scoops whatever flavor you like I love chocolate so I'm chosen to go with some weight chocolate protein next up we have our peanut butter we're going to put in four tablespoons and next up we have some lovely honey so we're gonna put in three tablespoons and there you have it those three simple ingredients are going to be your cookie base so this is where things get a little messy we're going to use our hands we're going to create a really nice smooth dough so get stuck in so using your fingers just rub together any little lumps of peanut butter or honey just to kind of break it up and really work together because you don't want any separation between any of the ingredients you want these cookies for really smooth and a really nice easy dough okay so when you have your love IDO here it's nice and smooth you've got two options you can wash your hands in sink or if you like me you can lick off the dough because it's really good at it so once your hands are nice and keen again you're going to take the dough and break it off into six sections I'm going to have your six actions taking each one just roll it around as you would with the protein ball and gently press in and with your index finger just create a small well in the center make sure you don't pierce the end of the cookie I've done that a few times just nice and deep but you can get a really nice amount of creamy filling in there and continue till the rest your job is done try not to eat it on the way so it's really good as it is so once you have your cookies all done X and you have your wells created in center we're gonna pop these in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 degrees till they're nice and golden crispy crunchy on the outside so my cookies are ready for their amazing peanut butter 4G filling so as you can see they're after expanding a little bit in the oven bigger cookies that's even better and they've gone nice and kind of brown and gold along the edges it's exactly what you want so now it's time to make this peanut butter filling what we're going to do is we're going to get our coconut oil and we're going to put in a tablespoon and a half then we're going to pop in our peanut butter so once again taste and half peanut butter and then just kind of let them melt together I'll take some time but just give it a good stir to kind of speed up the process now once it's almost melted we're going to just put in our final ingredient which is some honey so good stir we're almost here have a lovely smooth caramel filling and ready tip fill up our little wells with the cookies so you're going to put in just enough that it reaches the top and once you have these filled up all you're going to need is about pens if you want to pop them in the fridge or freezer heck with you I eat these in the freezer it's gonna take about five minutes to set and in the fridge give it a ten minutes there you go now carefully put these into the freezer to set there five minutes cookie be ready after a 5-10 minutes in the freezer our cookies are done so you want a nice firm center filling just like that and we're gonna drizzle dark chocolate this is optional but I love a little bit of chocolate so I've opted for very dark chocolate here I'm going 99% but it's just that little sensation of chocolate so we're going to drizzle over and once you have this drizzled over you can set them back to the fridge or freezer until the chocolate has hardened as well but if you're like me and you can't wait and you already have your cups you ready you can dig in straight away but before I go don't forget to subscribe to my channel and check out my instagram at natural-born feeder and of course let me know what you think of the recipe until then happy baking you", "2PxxKwh2ZuA": "[Music] like [Music] hello", "SUfjBR4vSMY": "hi everyone welcome back to my channel in this video i'm gonna show you how i turn my peanut butter cookie recipe into a vegan peanut butter cookie recipe so starting off by naming the animal products in my original peanut butter cookie recipe i have butter here which i will be replacing with some coconut oil and this is kind of my go-to replacement for butter because it has a rather soft texture at room temperature and the taste is quite nice and very neutral so i'm gonna do a one-to-one substitute on that and next up and the final ingredient in terms of animal products is the egg and if you have seen my vegan substitution video you will see that apple sauce is a nice substitute for when you have something that requires moisture and the main role of the egg is just to bind ingredients together in the cookies and provide moisture so i decided to focus on the moisture factor that's why i'm choosing applesauce for this recipe so for one egg i'm gonna be using four tablespoons of applesauce and just like that we managed to take a cookie recipe and turn it into a vegan cookie recipe if you want more info on vegan baking then head to the link in the description box i've put a link to my video early january i posted a set of guidelines for you to do these conversions yourself so the rest of the ingredients i kept the same so i have a mixture of granulated sugar and brown sugar i'm using light brown sugar and i find that this combination really gives the cookie a nice structure and moisture [Music] next up we have our dry ingredients i'm using all purpose flour here [Music] and to that i'm gonna add some salt some baking powder and baking soda typical cookie stuff just combine your dry ingredients before you add them to the rest of the ingredients [Music] now for the main ingredient we have peanut butter as the main flavor for the cookies so yes we're gonna be using quite a bit of peanut butter this is three quarters of a cup that's about 180 grams and i'm using smooth peanut butter you could also use crunchy peanut butter that might add a little bit of texture to the cookies if you like that then go for it it shouldn't matter now depending on the brand of peanut butter that you have available in your supermarket in the store um you might see that there's a consistency difference for example this is quite [Music] spreadable i would say it's not very oily but there are different types of peanut butter i found for example in vegan stores that they have a very runny sort of peanut butter perhaps there's added oils so you do want to watch out for that kind of thing and just bear in mind that if your peanut butter has a different texture then your cookie might need a little more flour or a little less flour now i'm gonna take the peanut butter and combine that with the coconut oil because they have similar textures i can just start by creaming the two together and i'm using my stand-up mixer but you can also do this by hand if you're using a stand-up mixer like i am then go for the paddle attachment the parallel attachment is your best friend when it comes to baking cookies so i started on low to medium speed just trying to combine the ingredients i'm not trying to add any air to this once everything is combined you can add your sugars and i just dump them all at once again i'm just gonna stir this until it's nicely combined before i forget there is vanilla extract in this recipe because you know me i have to have vanilla extract in everything make sure to scrape the sides of your bowl regularly now we're ready for our dry ingredients and you can just dump the whole thing at once and start your standup mixer if you're using a standard mixer you start in a low speed when you add dry ingredients otherwise you end up with flour all over your counter and kitchen now i wanted to stop here and show you the texture of the cookie dough you can see that it's pretty cracky when i press it so it needs a little bit of moisture and this is where our egg substitute comes in i'm gonna add a little bit of the apple sauce i'm adding a little bit at a time and checking the consistency as i go so again do a texture check because you might find that after adding two tablespoons or even three tablespoons that your dough has the right texture the texture that you want is you want to be able to squeeze the dough in your hands and not have any cracks and with that in mind i think my dough is ready so time to scoop the cookies out into even portions and for this job you know that i'm a huge fan of the ice cream scoop because you get even portions and this is important you want to be able to bake your cookies and have them all brown at the same time at the same speed so when you look at that it almost looks like an ice cream scoop so i'm gonna just shape it into a rough ball with my hands and then i'll be ready to shape them into their final form and i know what you're thinking this looks extremely tempting to eat just as it is but there is raw flour in there so no i don't recommend you having a bite out of this [Music] so i'm just gonna bake six cookies here because that's what fits best in my tray and i want them to be nice and evenly distributed and i want them to have space now to give them the signature peanut butter look we're gonna grab a fork and using the back of the fork we're gonna press down into the cookie balls and we're going to do this perpendicularly so we're going in one direction and then turn 90 degrees and press again and if you got the texture of the cookies just right then you won't have any problems of the dough sticking to the fork [Music] now let me just finish all of these cookies and we'll bake them straight away you don't need to put them in the fridge or let them rest these are just gonna come out beautifully straight away now they're gonna bake at a 180 celsius oven for about 12 to 15 minutes just watch out for that beautiful golden brown circling around the edge of the cookie [Music] and you can see that they do expand a bit so you do want to give them some space when you scoop them and shape them now the hardest part is usual letting them cool so once you let them cool completely because otherwise they will be too soft to move around and you might break them you want to just let them cool completely on the tray and then move them on to your wired cookie rack if you have one so let's take a look at the cookie we have a beautifully golden brown bottom crispy edges and even though the cookie spreads in the oven you can see that it has a very nice thickness to it it's crispy it's moist and most importantly it's packed with peanut butter flavor so i hope you liked this video and if you did please like the video and don't

today we're going to be making the most amazing 3 ingredient peanut butter cookies I'm just obsessed with this recipe I love it so much I started making this recipe about 6 or 7 years ago I think I think if I'm remembering correctly and I was living in the States in California at the time with my best friend who's from Canada and our granny emailed her one day and she was like you need to try these peanut butter cookies these three ingredient peanut butter cookies that are amazing so we started making them and we were just like obsessed with them we used to make them all the time like all the time and instead of using sugar which is what the original recipe used we preferred to use and healthier sugar alternative so today I'm really excited to share this recipe with you and hope that you love them as much as I do the three essential ingredients that you'll need for this recipe is one cup of natural unsweetened peanut butter two thirds of a cup of pure coconut sugar you can also use xylitol sugar if you want to and one egg the first thing that I'm going to do is crack an egg into my mixing bowl then I'm going to add one cup of natural and sweetened peanut butter and 2/3 of a cup of pure coconut sugar and I'll just mix that all together as the cookie batter starts to get thicker it sometimes gets a little bit easier to mix it with a fork now this is totally optional but I'm going to add a pinch of cinnamon about a quarter of a teaspoon and a little ground vanilla powder you can actually use unsweetened vanilla extract and a tiny pinch of sea salt don't add sea salt if your peanut butter already has added salt but it's best to use peanut butter that doesn't have added salt then give it another quick mix so I've already preheated my oven to 180 degrees Celsius which is about 360 degrees Fahrenheit and I've lined a baking tray with some parchment paper you actually don't need to even grease the baking tray because there's already enough natural oils in the peanut butter and so it should be really easy to lift the cookies from the baking tray when they're ready at this point I like to give the cookie batter another quick mix with my hands so that it actually starts to look like cookie dough and now I'm going to roll the cookie dough into small balls that are all about the same size and after I've added the cookie dough balls to the baking tray I'm quickly going to arrange them so that all of the cookies have enough space between them on the tray now I'm going to gently push them down with my fingers onto the tray to give them a cookie shape and then this is optional but I'm going to gently press the back of a fork into each cookie to give it some little lines on top this always looks really cute and now the cookies are ready to go in the oven so you'll bake them at 180 degrees Celsius or about 360 degrees Fahrenheit for eight to twelve minutes depending on how soft or crunchy you like them I like to do them for 12 minutes now just take note that when you take them out of the oven they won't look properly cooked but they are this is just because they need a set so don't try to lift them off the tray yet just leave them to cool for a few minutes so that they can set baking them for 12 minutes should definitely be long enough if you bake them for longer they might become too dry and once they have cooled properly then you can eat them this recipe makes roughly 16 to 22 cookies depending on what size you make them but here's a little tip if you measure out the batter to make 20 cookies then each cookie will only be 100 calories H which is the perfect amount of calories for a little high protein healthy snack they're amazing fresh out of the oven a glass of almond milk you can also use coconut milk or you can save them in an airtight container for some cheeky snacking they should keep in an airtight container for up to a week thank you so much for watching this video I really hope that you've enjoyed it and I

these are nice soft, chewy, peanut butter cookies, and I think you're going to love them Let's go ahead and get started. The first thing we want to do is combine 10 tablespoons of room-temperature unsalted butter, 2/3 cup of tightly packed light brown sugar, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat these together until well creamed. Now we'll add 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter into your batter. Now, I do not recommend using natural peanut butter for this recipe, the kind that separates and you have to stir I stick with just regular, creamy, peanut butter Stir in one large egg, and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Now set your wet ingredients aside and let's prepare the dry ingredients. You'll need one and a half cups of all-purpose flour, and add one tablespoon of cornstarch. The cornstarch is going to help make these peanut butter cookies nice, and soft, and chewy. Stir in 3/4 teaspoon of baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and now gradually stir your dry ingredients into the wet to make your peanut butter cookie dough. Okay, now, we'll cover this cookie dough and transfer it to the refrigerator where we'll chill it for 30 minutes. Once the dough is chilled, Preheat our oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and retrieve your peanut butter cookie dough from fridge. Now, use a one and a half tablespoon size cookie scoop and scoop the peanut butter cookie dough into balls. Roll the dough between your hands into a smooth ball and roll each cookie dough balls through granulated sugar before placing it on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. Make sure to place the cookie dough about two inches apart; and then use a fork to gently make a crisscross pattern over each cookie and gently press them down. Alright, now we'll bake these cookies in our 375 degree oven for about 8 minutes. Allow them to cool completely on their baking sheet. That is how you make my favorite soft and chewy peanut butter cookies. These are so nice and soft I think you guys are going to love them. And I really hope you will try them out and let me know what you think.

Papa G here.  Today I present\nmy soft and chewy low carbohydrate peanut butter cookies.  Some version of this classic\ncookie have a tendency to be a little on the dry side.  I've replaced one or two\ningredients to help soften the texture, while still keeping that great peanut\nbutter cookie taste.  Let's get started. Standard peanut butter cookie recipes\ncall for brown sugar, which is simply just white sugar mixed with a bit of\nmolasses.  To help mimic that flavor, we're gonna create our own maple syrup by\nadding a third of a cup of tapioca syrup and a teaspoon of real maple extract. \nMix together well and set aside.  Add a half a cup of vegetable shortening to a\nmixing bowl and a granulated sugar substitute equal to 3/4 of a cup of\nregular sugar.  Cream both together.  We're using shortening instead of butter in\nthis recipe.  Shortening is a hundred percent fat, whereas butter is about\neighty-five percent.  This extra fat will give our cookies a softer texture.  Add\none lightly beaten egg and a half a cup of natural creamy peanut butter.  Mix with\na spatula to incorporate.  Use a downward motion, pressing the mix to the sides of\nthe bowl to help mix in the shortening and sugar substitute.  Now add our\nhomemade maple syrup and give that a mix. Add some salt; some baking powder; and\nsome baking soda. Once everything is mixed together, add\none and a half cups of almond flour.  Stir and mix the almond flour in.  Once our\nbatter is thoroughly mixed, cover with some plastic wrap and place in the\nrefrigerator for at least an hour to overnight.  Once our batter has a time to\nchill, remove from the refrigerator and we'll begin to construct our cookies. \nGrab some cookie dough with your hands and roll into a ball, measuring no more\nthan about an inch.  Repeat until all the dough is rolled.  This batch rendered 24\ncookies.  You may get a little more or less depending on the size of your dough\nballs. Place the dough balls on a parchment\nlined baking sheet.  Be careful not to overcrowd, as these cookies will spread\njust a bit when cooking.  Gently push the dough balls down with your hands to form\na small circle.  Now traditional peanut butter cookies have an obligatory\ncrisscross pattern on the top.  I didn't want to get in trouble with the cookie\npolice, so I decided to add it to the top of mine.  If you add this step, you may\nwant to oil the fork to help prevent it from sticking to the cookie.  Place the\ncookies in the middle of a preheated 375\u00b0F oven for 12 to 17 minutes, or\nuntil the outer edges of the cookies begin to brown.  If you're baking two\nsheets at a time, rotate the cookies halfway through the baking process.  When\nthey're done, it's important to let them cool completely before handling them.  At\nleast 20 to 25 minutes.  These peanut butter cookies have a great texture and\ntaste; perfect for when you want a little something sweet.\nThere you have it folks.

like a great idea at the store you know all-natural no salt no sugar and I got it home and I opened the jar I tasted some and it looks like oh and I don't know if you ever seen a dog with peanut butter but it's kind of like like Don and it runs off the toast and it just doesn't taste right so I thought what am I gonna do with this stuff right so I looked up a recipe for it to see if I could make some cookies and I tried it and did you know there are people on the internet that put up recipes that don't work so that may not be a surprise to some of you but anyways so I changed it and I got one that worked okay so I'm gonna show you that so for this yes you will need natural peanut butter I don't know what's gonna happen if you use regular um so either get some or make another recipe then if you got a jar stuck in the cupboard doing nothing well this is the recipe for you it's really simple tonight here's the ingredient if you've never seen this stuff it's kind of runny as you can see and because it's natural and it has no chemicals in it which is a plus Ashley you do have to stir it up with a spoon before you can even start to measure and you can see there's chunks in there so try to get that all evened out now the one advantage of using this stuff is you can absolutely control the amount of salt and sugar that you put into your cookie so that is a big plus okay since the measure is a cup and a half I use a half a cup and measure at three times now you can see it's really oaky so be slow and measuring that I saved my spatula to scrape it on and stir it up okay so there's half a cup close enough I'm gonna scrape down the bowl and do two more times well that was fun okay so I got my peanut butter and the bowl ready to go there my oven is preheated to 350 this is really important you do this first because these are strangely enough really fast to make and if you're waiting on your oven to preheat you're gonna lose the effect of the baking powder not that these really need lift but you'll notice at the end they give them a nice pattern on the top of the cookie that makes them look really store-bought so I've got my sugar measured and a ball and there is a reason I've got a big wide Bowl for this because I'm gonna be beating eggs in here as well so put in your baking powder down salt now for whatever reason you don't think there's enough salt add more but I find that a half a teaspoon for two dozen cookies lends just a nice little flavor without being too salty just mix the baking powder and salt briefly you know if you don't have baking powder you guessed you could use baking soda however do not use the box that you keep in the fridge because your cookies will taste funny and a similar ball just beat your eggs with a fork until they're well next end then add your sugar and portions I start with couple of two teaspoons so you notice once you've got that mixed in it will make sort of a ribbon and doing this by beating some air into it and using the baking powder it'll make your cookies nice and airy now they are a soft chewy cookie but it still is nice that they're not heavy and dense and you'll see what I mean when I finish so now no stages for this dump all of that in and just get the rest out with a spatula you want all the eggs and sugar in there so picking it up from the bottom next the peanut butter in here now I know this looks hopeless right now bear with me there's some kind of weird chemical reaction that you can see happening in front of you where all of a sudden that total running mess just starts to set up on its own look at all so just keep out it with a spatula for a minute until you can start to see it sort of kind of get pockets and threads in it so anyway I can describe you see you ready yeah when it looks like it's starting to stay put on its own dot is when you start to make the cookies no for this I always get gloves you can do this barehanded but I'll tell you right now your hands are gonna get really greasy and take forever to wash after you'll wish you hadn't plus gloves are just more hygienic so let me get my sheets and a pair of be right back you want to go pretty quick with these so what I'm going to do is just grab about that much batter use a spatula to drop it on the sheet get all my globs out and then I'm gonna even them up and make the cookies after they're all on the sheet that one just fell that was not on purpose so I'll see you in a bit okay so I'm missing a couple of cookies and I am absolutely determined to make two dozen so what you do to do that is just take a look not which ones look like they have too much pull some off it's kind of like dough play it's kind of like plasticine yeah just pull some off and borrow from one to the other until you've got two dozen cookies now if you're not obsessed with how many cookies you've got because I did say the recipe makes two dozen you can just go whatever and make them as is however about you by taking the effort to make sure that they're all the same size that way they'll cook evenly and also look nicer once those are evened up as good as you're gonna get don't take too long just grab one of the chunks and roll it in your hand till it makes the ball do that with the rest of them last step he's got a clean fork and briefly press them down I would not grease the fork they're greasy enough as it is they'll stick a bit but that's fine and that one's not cooperating so you can push it back into shape these will not really keep on the bake but it adds a little bit more texture and to this crosshatch is traditional those are all ready to go in now as for baking times the finished cookie is your personal preference ten minutes minimum will give you a sort of cookie dough texture completely and you're gonna wonder if the eggs are cooked right through I don't really recommend that 15 minutes is going to give you crispy cookies sort of like you got in a bag I personally find 12 to 13 minutes to be absolute optimum because you get chewy cookies that are baked all the way through so that's what I'm gonna do I'm going to do 15 minutes now 350 no convection and I'll see you in a bit okay 13 minute mark I set up my camera so you can look what they look like still in the oven and I'll just be a minute bit there for you yeah see they got that nice kind of store-bought crackle look so I'll just pop those out I don't know if you can see them let's put them on this stove now these are very soft right now so it's important that you not intersect the cookie with the thumb of your oven mitt because you'll just mash it flat so I'm gonna let these sit here probably for about 10-15 minutes before I even try to transfer them to the wire rack for complete cooling or else they'll just breaker spend about 15 minutes and they cool down enough that you can touch them they're not completely cool yet this is what they look like nice and soft I'll try a piece oh really good they're still warm so if you like your cookies warm I'm soft and slightly chewy problem no I'm gonna transform into gluing rock trash sent along to a cooling rack to dry out and cool off completely now if you want to keep this texture what's important is as soon as they're cooled off transfer them to an airtight container or yes they will dry out so that's how I make natural peanut butter cookies I hope you have a chance to use up that jar in the cupboard if you got one and if you like using natural stuff just go out and get one they're really easy and they're really good thanks for watching hope see you again", "JWwBWr_vGQY": "hey guys today we are making peanut butter cookies in our ninja foodie all having a whole lot of fun guys welcome back to my camper kitchen I am Chris from recipes that calm and today we are making peanut butter cookies in the Ninja foodie using our air crisp feature you can follow this recipe along at home by using a ninja foodie or using another air fryer or you can use the same temps in your oven if you want to follow this recipe we are making these cookies low-carb style so hang on guys because this is going to be SuperDuper delicious I am really really excited with the holidays coming up I've been wanting to do a cookie in the airfryer for those of you who are traveling and or don't want to heat at the oven and or maybe are in college in an apartment or something like that and you don't have access to an oven or we hear all the time someone's ovens out but they have something like an air fryer or an inch of foodie so we'd like to give you different ways of doing things and on top of that we're going to show you how we're making these peanut butter cookies Locard what I did to create this recipe is I just converted one of our tried-and-true peanut butter cookie recipes we used to use I just started playing around with some low carb ingredients and came up with a low-carb version so what we're using handful of simple ingredients we're going to be using a cup of natural peanut butter this is the stuff that you generally would have to stir this one's called a hundred percent peanut so that's the one we're using today I believe Smuckers has a version too that's just peanuts and salt you can just look on the label if it's it'll tell you what the ingredients are and you're just looking for something that just says peanuts and or salt and you don't want any sugar in it if you're trying to avoid sugar so that's what we're going with here then we need a 1 to 1 sugar substitute and for that we are using soo Crenn 1 and you can get this in our amazon influencer shop and/or other places online another similar sugar substitute that tastes very similar to this is a swerve which also sometimes you can find out in the grocery store so this is and I can never say it right a referral riffs are tall I don't know Mikey can usually say it he's not here so heaven help me anyhow this one is mainly that and then it has less than 2% of stevia in it and so this is the kind of sweetener that tastes a lot like sugar it just has a little bit of a cooling effect at the end and we're gonna offset that with some stevia drops you can get this also usually in the grocery store or in our amazon shop that's just another kind of this is a stevia a sweetener that helps kind of offset some of that cooling that we got going on there and we need an egg and that's it so I got to grab an egg out of my fridge give me a sec it might take me more than a sec if I forgot all right so we're going to put an egg in a mixing bowl I have my spatula down in this mixing bowl because I was using it to dig out the peanut butter out of my peanut butter jar so don't mind that sorry my phone is we're gonna take that egg and we are going to just beat it a little bit with a fork to break it up break it up in down in there okay and to that I'm gonna take my stevia drops and I'm going to add a teaspoon of them this is the English toffee flavor you can also get it you can get it in all kinds of different flavors this is just what I have in the trailer a lot of times I'll use the vanilla cream in substitute for vanilla whenever I'm trying to offset the sweetener so I'm just going to put a teaspoon of that in here all right and to that I'm going to add a cut of my super in my sugar substitute so I've got 1/2 cup there I'm gonna pour another 1/2 cup very carefully I'm gonna mix that together until it starts to get mixed together okay and then I'm adding a cup of my natural peanut butter natural peanut butter is a little bit let a little bit more runny than your traditional I'm peanut butter I just want to get it all out of the scoop here so I can mix it together maybe and then you're gonna just mix those ingredients together until a dough starts to form and I'm gonna bring this up to you guys once I get the dough to form so you can see what I'm talking about at the beginning that kind of looks like oh is the dough gonna form and then all of a sudden it starts to come together and you'll see what I mean so there you go that's a dope so we can take this and form it into a ball and that's what we're going to do clean this just a little bit but I have some room to work I'm also going to talk about what we're gonna put in the air fire really quickly so that I can clear my table just even a little bit more and so okay you can do your air fryer a couple different ways if you have a traditional air fryer you can just use your air fryer basket it typically will do okay i if you have a ninja foodie you can use the ninja foodie basket and it will do okay you're just gonna have to watch it and make sure you don't overcook it as you do your batches of cookies like you would in the oven the way I like to do it in my ninja foodie is using a low profile trivet see it's got it goes all the way down in there and then ninja also sells I believe this is their pizza pan that has holes in it and I don't think I've seen these on Amazon if I do if I can find them I'll link them in our Amazon influencer shop but I don't think I've seen them but you could use something similar and put it down in there I just like how they turn out better on this and that's I've made it both ways it works both ways it's just since I have that pan I like using it um one tip regardless of what you use is to make your peanut butter cookies into balls ahead of time and to put them out on a cutting board or silicone mat and do the crisscross shape on top of your cookie which we'll show you here in step in a second but do it before you put it in on something that has a hole in it because otherwise you're gonna be pressing part of your cookie through that and I noticed that is especially so when you use the basket because it presses it down into the crevices and then it makes it a little hard to get them in a castle so what we're gonna do is this is going to make two dozen cookies so 24 cookies so what I like to do is divide my dough into fourths and make six balls out of each fourth just ahead of time so that I can have a uniform sized cookie so that's what that's the way I typically try to do it and when you can go ahead and roll them all out here and I'm gonna fast forward while I do that and then we'll talk about the curse crossing here in a minute so Mikey's gonna fast forward as I make all of these peanut butter cookie balls [Music] okay here are my little peanut butter cookies and then to do the crisscross shape you just take your fork and you literally crisscross like that go down one way and down the other way and if your fork sticks for some reason I don't have that problem you can always dip your fork in water in between the crisscross it'll fix it so I'm gonna crisscross all of these and then we're gonna start baking in batches so Mikey fast-forward me again [Music] okay so now we're going to take our cookie sheet or our pizza pan that's what it is and I'm just going to put six on here at a time I just likes to do six at a time so I don't have to worry about them baking into each other you probably could get them to go just a little bit further than that but I really don't have a problem letting them go in batches so I'm just going to put six of my little cookies on here like that so I put one in the center and one on all the way around give it a nice room and I'm going to put it down in here like I said earlier if you don't have that pan you could always place them down in this and put this down in like you would normally do any of the ears right so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put this on ear crisp full at 325 and this goes from 8 to 10 minutes I'm gonna set it for 9 because my foodie is completely cold right now by the end of my batches of cookies I probably need to set it more towards 8 minutes because once it's heated up the cookies tend to cook a little bit faster one more thing for you guys if you are baking in the oven it's the same thing so 325 for 8 to 10 minutes all righty we'll see you back here in 3 2 1 and we are back um my cookies have been cooking for almost nine minutes in the ninja foodie on the air Chris feature you could have done this also in a traditional air fryer as well got just a few more seconds and we're gonna peek in there and see how it looks it's gonna be really hot so we're gonna have to be really careful three two one done okay oh I somehow accidentally oh I know what I did I hit my pan I hit the table and I slid my cookies together so despite the fact that I spread them out as I showed you let me show you why I wanted to spread them out to begin with because I think I baked them in together you see how that ended up happening it's all right they still cut they're not the kind of cookie to kind of really intrude on its neighbor all that much um I know good boundaries um but I'm gonna go ahead and separate them out now so that they don't get stuck together so in an ideal world you wouldn't do what I just did because that's really hot in there and the cookies do best when they cool for just a few minutes but we don't have an ideal situation going on because I messed up and hit the thing so so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and turn and skip a few of these off of here so that they can get away from each other yeah all right they're super super soft right now but when they cool for just a few minutes maybe five minutes they start to crisp up a little bit and that makes them a lot easier to handle and that's why I generally like for them to cool for a few minutes so they retain their shape and they don't fall apart on you because they could very much fall apart really easily right now I just don't really have an ideal situation going on here now if any of your cookie crumbs have fallen down into the bottom of your foodie which none have ours so we're okay but if that has happened to you you're going to want to remove that before going and doing the next batch because those will overcook in the bottom and then it kind of gives a smoky burnt smell even though the cookies themselves are frying so I would just make sure that you get any of that excess off of there have a little extra on the bottom of my pan that looks like so I'm gonna just wipe that down just to give myself a fresh start with my next little batch here so let's go ahead and spread them out like I wanted them and this time I'm not going to knock the knock them around one two three one two three four five six go this is cool enough to touch now I'm gonna put it down it here and turn this back on hit err Chris take it down to 325 and I'm gonna start baking them for eight minutes I can always add a minute if I needed to but while that's going on I am going to bring these up here so we can do a little taste test so they've set here for just a minute and they're still a little flimsy but they will completely hardened up let me show you what happens these are the ones oh goodness these are the ones I made last night and they are like nice and crisp so they can go like see if we can all right yes so the nice crunchy peanut butter not crunchy peanut butter but nice kind of crisp with a crunch peanut butter cookie okay now can't resist warm cookies it's starting to set up but it definitely has an out of the oven taste to it out of the oven texture nice and warm a little crisp on the outside but nice and soft and warm when they're hot like this but what I would do hmm let me just pull and by the time that batch is done these are gonna be cool enough you can stack on top of each other and put the other batch and just keep doing that until you get them all done and then you just need to keep them in either a ziplock bag or a after they've cooled or a sealed container for as long as they last that probably last like well around my people they're gonna last that long what they probably do all right for a week I would say if you want to keep him around that long they definitely would freeze just fine if you wanted to make up a batch and put them in the freezer so you could even do the cookie balls and maybe on wax paper and freeze them that way before you bake them or you could go ahead and make them and freeze them and just let them thaw when you want to eat them so either way but we like this video we'd love for you to give us a thumbs

recipe for my chunky chocolate peanut butter cookies they're so good and could not be easier to make so let's go over the ingredients so we can get started you'll need some all-purpose flour some plain greenish sugar brown sugar semi-sweet chocolate chips unsalted butter at room temperature some creamy peanut butter one egg baking soda salt vanilla extract and these are some salted peanuts that I've just chopped up roughly you don't need to be precise about that but that's a total optional ingredient I just love the combination of like salty and sweet and I think because these are peanut butter cookies by adding in the salted peanuts that's my favorite part about this cookie so first thing you want to do is get your oven nice and hot to 375 and then take some baking sheets line them with parchment paper and now we're just going to get right into the cooking I'm making this in my big standing mixture but you can just as easily do this recipe with a bowl and a regular old wooden spoon or a whisk or spatula does not you don't need any fancy equipment to cook remember that so in here I'm going to cream together both kinds of sugar with my butter this will take about a minute or so one until it's fully creamy and looks good we're going to add in my egg and my vanilla I'm just going to mix ounce once incorporated and while that's going I'm going to do really quick please I'm going to take my flour and my baking soda in my salt and I'm going to just mix these really really quickly together just because I don't want to get like one big lump of salt and one big lump of baking soda that's good and now this is almost why I wanted but not quite yet so I'm just going to give it another few seconds that looks good I'm just going to give us my mix here with my spatula because remember sometimes it doesn't always incorporate everything as look as well as I like it too so just take the spatula and just run it on the sides of the mixer of the bowl but now we're going to add in my creamy peanut and and this is just an optional thing you can always buy chunky peanut butter and completely forget about the peanuts I just like to use smooth peanut butter in salted peanuts because they have that extra but you know extra flavor from the salt and it's just so I could anything like me where you love the combination of sweet salty then these cookies are right up your alley so just mix in the peanut butter and just mix everything together until you have a nice smooth mixture that's perfect so now I'm going to turn this off I'm going to add in my dry ingredients and I'm just going to mix this enough so that the dry ingredients are incorporated but like I always say you just don't want to over mix it otherwise you're gonna end up with such a tough cookie I always giggle when I say that the cookies gonna end up being so tough and it won't be like a nice chewy fluffy cookie so I'm just gonna literally mix this until I can no longer see the flour that's perfect so I'm just gonna add in a chocolate chips now whoa and my peanuts and just mix this for a few seconds that's it doesn't take very very long and you don't want to over mix it that's just be number one key when it comes to baking unless you're making bread or a you know pizza dough or a pretzel there's something that does need a long time for it to need you know because you want that consistency then you want the texture to be chewy and you know not hard but you know what I mean like right like you don't want that make sure your might you don't want your cookies or your cakes it tastes like that so just give everything just a mix with my spatula that looks combined enough and now we're just going to go into rolling these bad boys now I'm only going to make a dozen tonight because she's my husband I and I want to bake the whole thing because chances are we would eat them so these is a great dough to freeze just put it in like plastic containers with a tight-fitting lid pop it in the freezer and then freeze them and if you want to defrost them right away put them in the put the batter the frozen batter in the microwave for 30 seconds and then it's perfectly ready and scoopable I do it all the time so now I'm going to do of course is take my little handy dandy ice cream scoop and put these on some parchment paper lined baking sheets put them a couple inches apart from each other because these will spread out just a little bit that's one now using your fingers or fork I'm just going to Pat these down just like so you can also use just use your hands of course these look great this one needs a bit more now these are gonna go into my preheated oven at 375 for about 8 to 10 minutes or until the edges or lightly golden brown the middle will not be completely set but that's because they will set as they cool and then after their cup they're cooked you want to let them cool completely and that will serve them my cookies baked for about 8 minutes I mean they bake really really quickly and then just let them cool completely I'm just going to go straight into one but I want the one with the most chocolate chips so you know I'm going after this one it's just peanuts that's the bomb the bomb diggity dog mmm what a delight salty sweet chocolaty chewy crunchy what's the definition of like the perfect cookie I have enjoyed spending time with me I'm going to go embarrass myself by eating at least three or four of these and I'll see you next time get this recipe nah go www Laura in the kitchen comm see ya", "4nO7Wmqe7Vk": "hi I'm chef Raphael and welcome to today's video if you new to the channel make sure you subscribe and hit the bell button when you do that you actually get notified whenever I have a new video out I do weekly videos sometimes two sometimes one depends but it's all about making you a better home cook or a backup so today's recipe is really simple three ingredients peanut butter sugar and egg and I'm showing you how to make peanut butter cookies I'm using the only peanut butter from blue bond you have to watch the video to the end to see how simple this adds up and how they end up I'll actually break into one crack bite into one and you'll see how get an idea of how is it is to make them and have it to the glass of milk let's get started so like I said this is a very simple cookie recipe three ingredients I'm using the blue band peanut butter we need half a cup which is actually one cup not half a cup half a cup is sugar and 1 egg 3 ingredients so I'm going to measure V 1 cup so that's one cup empty it this is a fun recipe you can do with your kids I can help you make the recipe I'll show you that especially the father they'll come in handy this we add the sugar and the egg [Music] mix [Music] now no baking powder no nothing so that all especially for the rising of the cave above the cookie and remember whenever you're making cookies we actually when don't use a lot of baking powder but the egg will actually raise this cookie is the one that will make it have a slight raise just make sure that the egg is fully incorporated so take a spatula and see the mixture becomes slightly dry and then this one now we start making forming it into balls small balls so try and scoop the same size of of a mixture to make it into a ball the idea is to whenever you're making equal size balls but because you want the cookies to bake evenly not some that are too big than the others which means that especially the bigger one if it takes longer time the smaller one will cook more and probably burn or become extra hard try and make them equal and this is the part where I'll say you can use your kids just make them into balls the same way they would work with plasticine so you have your tray all ready with one two three twelve balls and you need a and this is how you do it you press it like that and like that you form that shape train you great form that shape and the same time what you're doing is making it a little bit flat so that's it they apply the same pressure you would for all of them they should not be too thick and into the oven they will go at 180 degrees and this should take about ten minutes to bake [Music] so the cookies are ready one thing you need to note whenever you're making any cookies how you know it's cooked is on the edges to start becoming darker and when you turn them that's when they're there when you see the edges becoming darker that's when you know it's ready and on the bottom should be brown or slightly dark brown so these are good and then the other thing when you're baking cookies is they are usually very fragile when they are coming hot from the oven so it's first of all a very good idea to cool them that's why I put them on a wire rack and then when they already put them on a plate and when you cut into one it's like a cookie like any other but you know it's soft has some softness to it but as it cools down completely it will become more hard like a cookie would and these are still slightly warm [Music] then really love the crunchiness I'm getting from the sugar the real nice peanut flavor the one thing about the blue band peanut butter has some sweetness to it it's not on the salty side so this cookies is more on the sweet side and it's really nice actually I have made another recipe and I'll put the link on that on the video is that I've actually made cookies with flan but I like this one's better they the peanut butter flavor is not too much it's not overwhelming and you'll be pleasantly surprised three ingredients great cookies that you'll enjoy I hope you've learned something today put your comments on the comment section and I'll review them if you have any question that is and get back to you and check out more

delicious the blending of that peanut butter flavor and that soft chat late makes him everyone's favorite cookie today let's see have to make these peanut butter blossoms in five simple steps to make these cookies we'll need only a few ingredients peanut butter sugar some softened butter one egg at room temperature some vanilla essence or vanilla extract to add a wonderful flavor and aroma to our cookies some baking soda as a leavener and a bit of salt to balance the sweetness so let's start by mixing together all the dry ingredients apart from sugar in a ball so into the flour let's add in the baking soda and salt and give it a good whisk to make sure everything is evenly distributed in the flour and let's keep it aside you [Music] in another bowl add in the butter peanut butter [Music] and sugar and let's cream them together and don't forget to scrape down the sides of the bowel in between let's whisk them for about three to four minutes and now let's add in the vanilla extract and an egg and combine them together now let's add in our dry ingredients into this and mix them together and while mixing them together make sure there are no dry patches left behind and now we need to chill our dough we want our do to hold its shape while baking so we need our butter in the dough to be firm so that they can hold its shape while baking so keep it in the refrigerator for about 35 to 45 minutes or until the dough is cold so after 45 minutes our dough is ready for shaping [Music] so take small portions about 1 tablespoon of dough using a spoon or an ice cream scoop for even measurement and [Music] roll them into a bowl and place them on a baking tray lined with the parchment paper or on to a non-stick baking tray and take care to keep your cookies about the same size to help them bake in the same raids in the oven and leave about 2 inches space in between each cookie dough as it will spread a little when baked if you like your cookie to be more sweet and coated with some sugar then you can roll the cookie dough balls in sugar until they are generously coated bake the cookies at 350 Fahrenheit for 10 to 12 minutes or until they start to crack on the surface [Music] and after baking remove the baking tray from the oven and and let that cookies sit in the baking tray itself for about two minutes and then lightly press our chat with keys into the center of each cookie allowing it to crack slightly and beautifully [Music] now let's transfer this onto a cooling rack and let them cool down completely as we used cold peanut butter cookie dough they didn't melt and spread out much and that chocolate kiss hold its shape but stays soft when you bite into it it's really a perfect okay and one of the most favorite holiday cookies hope you found this recipe

to most of you you probably already heard about what this is but you know I don't know why I didn't hear about this before but alright let me just tell you from the title it is the three ingredient peanut butter cookie now I have tried this before actually last weekend sorry about my camera shaking I'm holding it with my hand and they came out really good all it is is a cup of peanut butter a cup of sugar or sugar substitute and one large egg so this is what you'll need as I said a cup of peanut butter I'm using creamy roasted peanuts and honey you can use whatever kind of peanut butter you want a cup of regular sugar or brown sugar it doesn't matter but I'm using sugar substitute so you need a cup of sugar substitute and then a large egg so let's get started okay pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and excuse me on a cookie sheet either line it with parchment paper or line it with a silicone mat like I have here because if you don't it may stick so in my bowl I went ahead and put my sugar substitute remember one cup and although this is really easy to follow if you need a recipe to go by it will be on my blog and the link will be below in the description we're going to add the peanut butter now one cup you can use crunchy if you want to also and that would be really good and if you want to make it four ingredients you can always put some chocolate chips in here or you can put maybe just just a little splash of vanilla it's just your choice but we went ahead and put that in then if you're using let me just put the egg in and I'll tell you if you're using regular sugar or regular brown sugar then I suggest after you mix this up put it and you know what it's it for at least 10-15 minutes or as long as your oven takes to preheat so we're just going to mix this in and it'll take a few minutes but it will form a dough I'm going to skip ahead of this and we'll come back when this is mixed okay this is what your dough is going to look like pretty much dough consistency and depending on how big you make your cookies I actually got exactly two dozen from this last weekend when I made them but I mean you can make them as thick as you want so that they're about one to two dozen depending on like I said how big you make them and as all of you know I am on Weight Watchers so I plug this recipe in to Weight Watchers if you make one dozen of these it's three points for cookie if you make two dozen of these there are two points for cookie yeah let's just show you how to do it you just get a little bit like this and roll it into a ball and just put them on your cookie sheet don't think you saw that let me just do it again take a little bit roll it into a ball put it onto the cookie sheet and I'm going to continue to do this I won't bore you with all of them but you take a fork to make them old-time you looking you know like your grandma or your mom used to make you can either put the fork in sugar or roll the ball actually in sugar or sugar substitute I don't do that I feel like it has enough sugar or sugar substitute in it especially if you use honey peanut butter like I did last weekend I made in plain you just don't do the crisscross thing and just like that and when you do that they kind of flatten out a little bit now you can put little Hershey kisses on these what you do is you bake them in a three 50 degree oven for about 8 to 10 minutes and then you just take them out cool them on a wire rack and enjoy them but however you spread them out like this this is how big they're going to pretty much be they won't spread out very much more than that when they're done I'll show you what they look like okay my little timer will set for nine minutes I'm taking them out of the oven right now to let you see what they look like oh look Adam you just take one off there oh come on now do you see that that's perfect perfect I tell you all right no burns perfectly cooked on the bottom I don't have lava hands I'm going to try Oh nope I don't guess I'm going to show you the bottom just take my word for it they're not burned at all it's amazing how three ingredients come together like that no flour in here at all and they're so good like I said if you're on Weight Watchers and there are two points per cookie if you get two dozen out of them and three points per cookie if you get one dozen out of them let me know if you've tried them leave me a comment below find me on Facebook and Twitter and send me a private message if you try these let me know how you like them thank you very much and I will talk to you later bye you", "FO_kbItrS9w": "hi guys well hardly doing a lot of savory cooking recently I thought today I'd do something a little different time for a little sweet time for a little peanut butter cookies on the one part chef I peanut butter cookies now simple recipe in my little mixing jug thing I have 125 grams of margarine that's about roughly half a cup roughly basically a couple of teaspoons my type of students rather we're also going to be adding 3/4 of a cup of white sugar and obviously peanut butter a bit random big glob of it really I probably say close to sort of half a cup just on the fingers but yeah it's getting an oven that's all right there we go so we've got our sugar our marjorine and our peanut butter and we're basically just gonna creamiest together if I cream together I mean we're gonna stir it up until all the combined they're nice and smooth and cream might actually use a wooden spoon for this because I need to really get some elbow grease into this you see what I made my creamy now has it's absolutely combining there and you'll know it's properly cream because when you actually move it around like this it'll stop having that sort of scraping noise you get when you have sugar in this to make for public we're also going to be adding one and a quarter cups of plain flour and one lightly beaten egg and we're just going to combine that we're also going to add a small amount of water just to help bring this together as this is a little drier than I expected there we go and what we end up having is a very thick sort of dough that's sort of barely together but that's basically what we're looking at that's what we're gonna be doing there it is scooping this into little balls and placing them on a tray here's our prepared oven tray all I've done is put some grease proof paper down we're going to preheat our oven to 180 degrees while we're doing this now using a tea spoon we're just gonna grab small amounts of this mixture and using the palm of your hand roll them into little balls okay so like that gonna place them on the tray and using a fork just gently press down just so looks like that so just repeat that with the rest [Music] well then we have our first batch just about ready to go into the oven there's 12 on here and there's still enough mixture to do at least another 12 so you can do 24 with this mixture at least so I put them in the oven 190 degrees Celsius for around about 15 to 20 minutes roughly just until they're golden brown I'll show you what they look like when they come out 20 minutes later and here are our completed peanut butter cookies they look absolutely delicious they're nice and golden brown they come straight out of the oven so you're going to leave them on the tray for another 10 minutes or so just to say they firm up and transfer them to a wire rack so they can cool off I hope you've enjoyed this video please check out my other videos at youtube.com slash one-pot chef's shop drop me a line at one pot chef

Kito kitchen on location we are on our summer vacation at the beach and as promised we have a very easy recipe tonight that has only three ingredients it's going to be peanut butter cookies and we're going to mix them together really quick and throw them in the oven so come along with us and let's get started so our three ingredients consist of natural peanut butter and I just thought the atoms Noster you can buy the kind that needs to be stirred if you want you can sometimes that whole food places or even grocery stores you can just pump out natural peanut butter and just buy it in bulk but what you need is one cup of some kind of natural peanut butter you just want it to be ground peanuts and salt you don't want anything else you don't want any sugar in it so be sure and check the label but atoms is I know sugar peanut butter and we're going to need 1 cup of that we're also going to need sweetener I have bought mine in a bag as for on location and I'm using a cup and it's 1/2 of a cup of your wrist were tall monk fruit blend granular and a half a cup of your throat all month fruit blend powdered and I just have that in my bag and it's a cups worth and then you also need the aid to make your third ingredient I have let mine sit out actually I didn't let it sit out I find that room-temperature eggs work best but if you don't put yours out a while before you decide to bake you can just put it in a cup of warm water for about 5 to 10 minutes and to bring it up to room temperature just find that it blends a little easier that way so we're gonna start with our peanut butter and we need 1 cup and I'm gonna eyeball it instead of using my cooks really hard to get peanut butter out of a cup but that gives me kind of an estimate 1 cup is by the size of that so it's about half the jar maybe a little more of your peanut butter I'm going to add my sweetener and again that's one cup if you want your peanut butter cookie is some not as sweet you can use less sweetener some people like to make these streets for their pet and you can just completely omit the sweetener or use a pets a sweetener and then the one egg and then I'm going to use my electric mixer or their electric mixer and we're just going to blend this together start starting out for our mixer didn't have a slope it pulls together very fast so you really don't need to use the hand mixer for very long in fact if you don't want to use a hand mixer you don't have to I'm just going to make sure everything is well incorporated with my spatula before I start putting this into cookies and as you can see by the dough it's very similar to regular peanut butter cookie dough so now we're going to take this we're going to put it on a cookie sheet and we're supposed to get 15 cookies out of this amount of dough and I'm gonna put it on a cookie sheet and I'm using a silicone mat you do not have to have a silicone mat but you can find these on Amazon very inexpensively will link some below that's where I got mine it's very handy if you don't have a silicone mat you can always use parchment paper but the silicone mat makes it so easy and they seem to form very well using a silicone mat so I'm going to take a regular tea spoon that size and I'm going to start forming 15 balls and of course you can make your cookies any size that you want but we are supposed to be able to get 15 out of this batch of cookies and that's what the macros will be bores for 15 cookies so so I like to do mine 3 down and then I'm gonna do 5 across to add my 15 and they don't need to be very far apart because they're not going to expand a great deal when you're baked so they will stay fairly similar to the size after we flipped our fork marks into them like traditional peanut butter cookies that's about the size they will stay when you bake them I took these camping and they were big hit and I've also my girls now traditionally peanut butter cookies are scored on the top with a hash mark so all you have to do is just take a regular kitchen fork and press down once and then turn it the other direction and press down again well you have your mark so you just need to go through and do that to all of the cookies 15 minutes but I'm gonna check at about 12 from the 12-minute mark on just because this is not my oven and so I'm not precisely sure how long they will take okay and that is it like I said they'll stay around about the same size that they are right now they don't really expand too much so I'm going to put them in 350 and my cookie sheet is large so they're all done it took 15 minutes in the seven and you can see that they're just slightly Brown around the edges they don't get real real Brown you don't want them to get super dark brown and I'm gonna transfer them to a towel to cool and then when they're fully cool they should come off the cookie sheet no problem especially with this silicone mat like I said we will link the silicone mat below that I got mine on Amazon and it's great and they're not very expensive so there's your easy cookies back and forth to the van keep it tight get the buckets exactly that's that's the truth of vacation we're debating whether or not parents actually get to vacate anymore it's not really what would you like that cookie yes okay while they do get where they saw like one thing once they cool Ramon salt peanut butter cookies I guarantee really so yeah takes about five to ten minutes but they have a nice sandy texture that a traditional peanut butter cookie has they're like you know good new I wouldn't know that this was yeah anything

high protein wheat free cookies they are made gluten-free because they're made out of almond flour so they're paleo friendly keto friendly gluten-free friendly so it's three simple ingredients four if you want to take the cookie to a completely different level and trust me it's so worth it and you know what you guys should have this on your kitchen counter anyway because the nutritional benefits of buckwheat i can go on and on and on and not enough people realize that this nutritional bullet right here and it's so simple to prepare you see this powerhouse of nutrients right here those are dehydrated already it's so simple look you take a bowl i have my raw buckwheat groats right here so for that amount you know just that's one and a half cups right there cover it with good water okay right put it aside on your counter for a couple hours drain them rinse them till the water runs clear and then just lay them out on your dehydrator sheet evenly and dehydrate for two hours and then you get these little crispy powerhouse nutrient little balls there and they taste like rice krispie treats when you put them in whatever in your cookies or in your raw balls so very important okay let us just throw the recipe together i have got a cup of peanut butter if you're not into peanut butter you can always use a different nut butter like almond um almond butter is good it's high protein keeping it high protein peanut butter so sticky okay now i got my almond flour a cup and one fourth and then i to that i'm going to add just a little bit of maple syrup so i got about a third cup i'm gonna put it in there and a little vanilla okay so five ingredients the amounts are so my new it doesn't really count the cookies would be fine without a little vanilla or salt but if you have it just add it okay okay also you can use pumpkin seed butter now they don't sell pumpkin seed butter in stores here in vegas but they do sell it in california or you can get it online it's very high protein and if you are too skinny i do marcus and i do have people writing us saying how do i gain weight i can't gain weight pumpkin seed butter is your new best friend in that department pumpkin seed butter will have you putting on weight like nobody's business pumpkin butter in general like um i wanted to kind of mix up my my nut butters so i got pumpkin seed butter to put in my um protein smoothies oh boy did i put on a lot of weight really quick and i'm like okay it's good for me because i'm and i need to put on a little bit of weight for my bodybuilding journey okay what am i looking for now okay so you see i mixed that all up it's kind of dry which is okay and then i'm gonna add the rice krispies otherwise known as i call them buckwheaties i'm just gonna stir that up and then of course you can add um raisins we put raisins in there and some chocolate cacao nibs but uh yeah and be creative that's the beauty of raw foods einer and go get a dehydrator tray i'll be right back okay i'm gonna put them on this because i don't want them to take on little squares or be indented by the uh by the frame of this sheet so here we go i'm just making them in little balls laying them down and we are going to dehydrate these for anywhere from five hours to overnight see nice little ball just a round little ball and then and then flatten it so it's fun to do like maybe a layer of the ones with raisins another layer of cacao nibs maybe another layer of just the crispy the rice crispy treats or buckwheaties or all of them together you know just make one really big cookie but anyways you guys get the gist then i'm gonna pop these in the dehydrator like i said anywhere from four hours to overnight the beauty of this is they don't burn you know so you could keep them in all night these were different a few different batches they were in for different amounts of time and you see they're still very delicious and edible mmm this one's a rice crispy treat [Music] oh my gosh again i'm not acting oh my gosh well the one with the rice krispie treat takes it to a whole other level i haven't had the rice krispies treat one yet even though i made them oh my god it's delicious you guys oh i didn't show you oh yeah i did okay see fill it with water make sure you have it about an inch or two above because these buckwheat growths are going to absorb all the water pop them in the dehydrator for two or three hours and then take the dehydrator sheet fold it up and put it in a container what you want to do so that you can get the nutritiousness out of the buckwheat throw it in your desserts throw it on top of your salads mix it in your cookie dough get it in there i put it in my smoothies too it's great so good uh again i'm not acting have to this is so good okay guys well thank you so much for joining me again i very much look forward to seeing you in my kitchen in another video i hope you guys are having a great day bye you", "yBeEbWqhjIY": "[Music] alright Charles so today we

Peanut Butter Cookies with Kisses (Easy Recipe) There's so many great types of Christmas\ncookies but who has time too bake dozens of different\nkinds of treats? The answer is have a cookie exchange. Hi. I'm Cricket Azima. With a cookie exchange, each guest bakes\none kind of cookie, and then everybody swaps and goes\nhome with a wonderful assortment of holiday yumminess. Whether you're hosting or participating,\nI've got a couple great recipes that are perfect\nfor you to try. We're going to combine two of my\nall time favorite ingredients-- peanut butter and chocolate. Yum! These peanut butter blossoms\nare a holiday favorite that everybody's sure to love. First start by preheating\nthe oven to 375. Start with a peanut butter cookie\nmix and add water, oil, and egg. Stir until a dough forms. I've made\nsome dough ahead of time. We're going to take about a teaspoonful\nand roll into a ball and dip it into some sugar. After you filled the cookie sheet,\nplacing the balls about two inches apart, bake them in the oven for\nabout eight to ten minutes. As soon as you take the cookies out of\nthe oven, you want to take one of the unwrapped Hershey's Kisses and\npress it into the cookie. Remove the cookies from the sheets onto\na cooling rack so they can cool completely before eating. These peanut butter blossoms\nare always a hit. Next we're going to make a cookie with\nthe present baked right inside-- chocolate snowballs. We're going to start by using\na sugar cookie mix. Then you're going to mix in butter or\nmargarine, an egg, some all-purpose flour, some unsweetened cocoa, and some\nfinely chopped almonds, and some almond extract. Stir all the ingredients together until\na dough forms. And then you're going to roll the dough into balls. And here's where the present comes in. Make a little well and then take one of\nthe Hershey's Kisses chocolates and tuck it inside. Wrap the dough around so that the\nchocolate candy is completely tucked in and hidden. As you make the balls of dough, place\nthem on your cookie sheet about two inches apart. Bake them in the oven for\neight to ten minutes. When they're out of the oven, you're\ngoing to let them cool for about five minutes so they're safe to handle. Then, roll them in some\npowdered sugar. You're going to let them cool completely\nbefore you roll them in powdered sugar a second time. Now they're really going to start\nto look like snowballs. With these recipes, your cookies\nare going to be a huge hit. And not only will you get to enjoy\nyour own tasty treats, you get to sample all the wonderful baking\nyour friends bring over too. i'm Cricket Azima, bringing you great\nideas from Betty Crocker, Hershey's, with Howdini.

2/3 cup of agave 1/4 cup of grapeseed oil we're going to blend it together and then we're going to add the dry ingredients a quarter teaspoon of sea salt then we're going to add a cup of flour tap

dark chocolate peanut butter burgers kidney this whole thing is ranked really you think but I think that you guys tell me so we prepared were you living recipes just a normal chocolate chip ones before I did whole video doing that which was crazy we're just a new to today because honestly the chocolate peanut butter ones are kind of hard to find I mean there are a decent water recipes not as many as the other ones but the silver pickings what can I say so we decided on to assign them to you keep your Jordan e as we go through the two and we'll see how they compare we'll see which one is better and I can't wait because chocolate peanut butter come on this is the best combo after so nothing can really go to wrong here I don't think let's go alright guys the G recipes we're doing are the modern honey and Mike bakes New York City cookies we did his normal cookies it was like a small batch one which we really good so I'm excited to see how is dark chocolate ones are and looking at the recipes right here I think the best way to do this I was trying to do someone is a setup here but it's not really don't wouldn't feel so far away I think I'm gonna do it simultaneously which could go in to be a disaster I don't want to act something like a baked something ingredients but we're gonna try it like that so the first one we're doing it modern honey modern the honey uses double imago butter is the other one so if they're running almond butter the other ones already looking pretty good for you and he asked that both of them rock cold butter so we're just gonna chop off the cold butter I've noticed before start mix that all around is that this one requires more sugar and more brown sugar the other one only requires this replace a cup and a half to the Sun I'm putting in the sugar and then I put a good amount of molasses for the brown sugar okay we're next this new plan we're switching to these Red Bulls because there's too small I don't know honestly I'm using these because they kind of make those boys that your mom dad would get you kicking as a child but we gotta use them okay so number two or like I said this would only require one six butter and a total of rebirth cup of sugar and this will Phelps the same exact process of basically just whipping it all together for four to five minutes next is that billion on the next steps guys so as you can see basically they look exactly the same this one just looks white bigger and this one is just like a teeny on a badly but basically it looks the same pretty standard cookie stuff going on here nothing nothing to see here something I should've checked in the beginning and that's how many cookies does each of these make it sounds like Mike's seeming to be a smaller batch just one Mike's fake makes for this wanna makes eat everything I said I I you know I stand corrected and okay so that's interesting we can't really compare gradients unless you like proportion it out I don't know what's going on anymore the most important thing is going to be the taste test in the texture and all that stuff honestly these is a lot better than honey I'm not gonna scare you but like okay yes we're come on strong we've done the wet ingredients now we need to move on to the dry ingredients off both of these use a mix of normal flour cake flour cornstarch baking soap nuts so they're kind of coming along pretty similarly we'll see if it's worth it actually you know for me to try both these recipes and compare them because I'm kind of questioning it now but we'll see the other Libyan cookie recipe did the processes and the ingredients I thought were like pretty different but this reminds me when I was in middle school we had to carry around the flour sack baby and then I accented up yukio my father said baby and had to throw it away it was great and it was so cute he was such a good good child I mean it was a shame how to throw them away okay the first one is done it's looking real pretty now we got to add in the rest of the dry to that one as you can see I already started to cuddle my stop there a little oopsie there's all she's going on but I feel like this is the worst single box well it looks like you're looking it's like a vortex or something I'm gonna try that check for youtubers like snap their fingers and the mess is gone because why not still here okay so let's do do I need to remember this one is that one this one was what's wrong I don't know I did it like that they have a very similar texture this one this one out of honey seems a little thicker and this one seems a little later shrimp out in hundred first chocolatey yeah sure this one tea equally chocolate don't you're thinking we'd add for the trypsin right let's put them in it is okay we have a look at the left so it's just like top now you get some there's a lot more peanut butter chips and this one compared to this dough so we'll see next thing we need to do okay so modern honey it just puts her I think in the fridge it's such chill it for ten minutes now you did anything about putting into like balls or whatever it was for you in the fridge I on the other hand wants us to put these into four balls and then put them in the fridge for 30 minutes okay so this dough seems kind of sticky so we'll see how it is interesting thing is that neither of these have a really long cool time which all good-looking cookie recipes like me um do you have a long cool time so we'll see oh actually likes my not if I've done the same as this so we'll see they're too sticky for me to enroll like this one I just kind of left off funky happens a little soon it's almond thing it's fine okay so they look okay she said to flatten them down so I just gave them a little so we're good to go you're the first ones and they're definitely wait bigger and flatter than I thought I mean this is my hand next to them they may not that cold darn off they spread more because it's so hot in my apartment so I'm gonna put them in the freezer and do a little Tufts on them but for now they'll do I mean they still look really good they look gooey in the center's and like hard on the outside so right now they're hardening and we're gonna put the other ones in alright guys these are the second ones they need to go in for like 14 to 15 minutes we'll see how these ones turn out now this is what I'm talking about look at these things this is Mike's baked they came out really good shape they're big they're thick they're everything you could want now we get a lot them brass what else is frickin boom this is Mike's and these are modern honey's so modern honey's are a lot mine spread a lot these are really big I don't know I doesn't know there's a difference this one's a lot wider if and this one's a lot thicker and has that one really bumpy cookie feel here's another one of modern honey's that I put in the freezer and then I cooked and it definitely held its shape a little better but it still spread quite a bit in Hani's picture i mean they're not super thick looking cookies but I don't think they were in this then so I'm thinking I have to do with the heat and my kitchen but which one should we try it first I'm so excited let's try it go on now they're both a little warm so I hope this one is done in the middle because I'm not sure it is oh I think it's done you're not going on it oh it's pretty goopy and I like under big cookies but I'm feeling like this one is too much for bait like it'll harden as it goes on but well let's try something like the end piece this is freaking good really good chocolatey it around a peanut butter the bottom too chewy now let's try Mike bakes oh wow look how thick this is oh my god these are both so lose it like lava chocolatey peanut butter it's amazing this one definitely has a better amount of peanut butter in there I love peanut butter I think you know maybe add some more chips to the modern honey one and that would be great but they're both really good but I will say that Mike's is the most foolproof even for a hot forking kitchen like mine is I don't know what it is but his I remember when I made his small batch semion cookies and I also did a video like I said before that was like comparing three out of living cookie recipes his chocolate chip ones were the most foolproof again like they held their seat really well and they looked kind of like this one like they were thick and have any mishaps with either of his recipes so he kind of has like a foolproof recipe thank you guys for watching hopefully you'll try one of these now if you tried modern honeys and if you yours came out like this or not I'm like a nominee as a user error I don't think it's RSP it's a good recipe I think the main takeaways for me are just probably keeping in the fridge longer and also making it a little more you know especially in the summer if you're in a hot kitchen that's fine but otherwise it's really really good too so I don't see how I can really go wrong with either recipe so is that helpful at all okay thanks for watching I have a lot of other lemon cookie recipes finally take a little break for a bit on these because the real killer is you know what does that mean have a great day catch you later the next bed I", "SCm_sXblpPs": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back for another episode airfryer frosh hey if I wonder who this ball guy is I don't really wear my hat and I don't have any hair on top people that know me not that I need the mask but I made the mask because I'll tell you here in a minute but this is a very simple - to make out a t-shirt little backstory a company contacted me said they have masks and surgical masks the three layer ones you see at the hospital not that they would prevent Kevin 19 or it's better than nothing so I went having to purchase them and a few days later they contacted me back and said you know we did some praying and we decided that we're gonna send these masks to the frontlines and if you guys would like a refund we can send you your money back or you can wait another three weeks and they'll get another shipment in so I appreciate what they're doing the US and to the front lines but you know some of us regular people need them also because some states are requesting anyway right at the moment that you wearing white you go out to the store and stuff like that especially here in Ohio the CDC is requesting that you are so that's why I made these t-shirt masks I know they don't protect a hundred percent but it's better than nothing but anyway let's get into this this air frock Friday deal friend of mine wanted me to make gourmet sandwiches I will be making them home if I'm gonna post another episode today or not Easter is upon us this coming Sunday we really don't have anything in the house you know as far as anything for Easter thought I'm gonna make some peanut butter cookies and this is gonna be a really simple recipe it's only three ingredients and most of you should have these ingredients in your household but what you're gonna need is one cup of sugar 1 egg and 1 cup of peanut butter so we're gonna go ahead and dump our sugar into our Bowl 1 cup of sugar and put our peanut butter in and we'll go ahead and put our head again and then all we have to do is stir this up - I got my wooden fork and we're just gonna stir this up real good by the way have you ever seen this Little Debbie peanut butter cookie sandwich snacks you get they're real big I mean they haven't small size also I haven't seen the small size ones lately but big ones they come in the big pack I usually get this for my launches this things are huge I figure you know I can make some many ones so after I air fry these I'm gonna take some peanut butter and make a peanut butter sandwich out some of these then you know just cook the rest of them there's a regular peanut butter cookies alright once we're done with that yeah get you a fork candy and you want to take and roll these out into about 1-inch balls and I do have my cutting board here that's the only flat surface I have alright so we've got them all rolled out we got 19 we're probably gonna pushed two dozen out of this but this is fine I do have my air fryer basket I haven't lined with parchment paper here I'm just gonna drop them in here I'm gonna have to cook several batches I do have these wire racks but oh I don't know how much longer that take so I'm just gonna do however many I can get my pan but then you want to take your fork and you want to do some crisscross under cookies you could go an extra step and roll these back in the sugar if you want but I'm just gonna leave it like they are there's already plenty of sugar in yours one cup of sugar I mean more sugar isn't gonna hurt you right now all right once we have our cookies crisscross like that I'm not gonna fill this all the way up because these are gonna spread out a little bit so I'm just gonna set these in the bottom they should spread out in theory I'm just gonna line it with seven I got seven in here for now I don't know how far these again spread out so I'm just gonna do this first patch like this we're gonna put them in the air fryer actually I need to preheat it to 350 degrees I am I'm gonna put it in for eight minutes but I didn't preheat it so I'm just gonna do 350 for eight minutes and I'll be right back one more thing a lot here real quick my buddy that requests the gourmet sandwiches he want a gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches which I have stuff and make this like saying stay tuned ah I wonder if I'll post it today or if I'll do for another day anyway he asked me why I'm not using my camera rig was doing the handheld and I was like man that's just been rough lately with everything going on I just don't really feel like putting it all together I just want to grab my camera I go it's more of a pain in the butt for you guys to see what I'm doing since I'm holding it one-handed and stuff like that so I got the rig back out and it just rigs kind of heavy I've got tripod and then I put some PVC on it it's a angle with my GoPro coming back my GoPros up here pointing down of course I may show you a shot of it or I might just put a video how I made it how about do that if you're interested I went ahead and got everything back now today I got carried from my studio back in my office on the other side of house all the way up to the kitchens I usually put the camera on both cameras on and then carry out with microphones that everything's alright so my first batch of cookies come out of course it's like I said I put in for 8 minutes because I didn't preheat the airfryer and they came out pretty good I scout let them cool off and then we'll taste test them like I said I'm like make them into peanut butter sandwiches tea I'm not sure that these are gonna be not as big as this one I was talking about the Little Debbie ones but it'll be pretty rude so maybe we won't I'll try a couple but I got my other ones in here we're gonna let these cool off and then we'll give it a taste test all right let's grab a couple of these spritz and let peanut butter on here take another one mash it on there Oh got a big peanut butter sandwich cookie should be nice and hopped up on sugar tonight just gonna give this a try that's pretty good it's crumbling a little bit but that's fine

it anyway hope you guys enjoy your Friday and I will see you guys next time [Music]", "5p9s35JO5R4": "hello welcome to mamasa's kitchen i hope you're doing great today it's a beautiful day here in alabama it's warming up a little bit and this next week is supposed to be in the 60s it in the daytime so we're going to get a little hint of spring but i um i want to tell you before i start cooking i always wash my hands before i start the video i had someone comment the last time that they had never seen me wash my hands and you know i don't video me washing my hands but i do start with clean hands so just know that i like to try new excuse me new recipes harold's favorite dessert would be homemade cookies he loves them he loves every kind and this past week i was mailed a recipe from a sweet lady one of my followers sharon hill and she said this is her family's favorite cookie recipe and we love peanut butter cookies but sharon i have to tell you that i have never seen this recipe so i definitely wanted to try it she said it's very easy and that's what we like it only has four ingredients and we're gonna make them and we'll learn together how they turn out but i know they're gonna be delicious we're going to start out with bisquick all right we're going to take two cups of this quick i have a frog in my throat i don't know if that's a southern side or not there's one and i try to pour it maybe it won't make such a loud noise okay and two cups okay to that i'm going to add one 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk this is the walmart brand you can use eagle brand if you would like but just sweet and condensed milk one can all right i'm gonna pour that in i don't know if you're like me but i any time a recipe calls for eagle brand milk or sweet condensed milk i love it all right i'm going to use my spatula that had that i got the peanut butter out to just get all of this out of the eagle brand milk can i call it eagle brand milk when it's not it's great value and then one cup of peanut butter and i use creamy now some of you probably are gonna say can you use crunchy i would think so i'm not saying my recipes are always the best so you always put what you think you would like and then two teaspoons let me put this here because i want to get that off two teaspoons of vanilla no one teaspoon and y'all i will post this recipe up above my uh video so you'll always have it just know that that's what i'm doing now is after the video i go and post a copy of the recipe so let me get all of this off and i'm going to use my hand mixer to mix it up it's going to be a little noisy while i do that [Applause] right almost for small things that do not have many ingredients i just use my hand mixer i don't get out the um kitchenaid even though it stays over on my counter it's just easier for me to uh to use the uh hand mixer i'm gonna take these off and i'm gonna get this out y'all only four ingredients bisquick peanut butter condensed milk and vanilla flavoring you can't bake that all right let me get it out of here i've got a a surprise coming up maybe in a week and let me get my scoop i'm sorry i didn't have it um i'm not gonna tell you about until it's up and going but i'm hoping it's something that will help you you know when you're older technology doesn't come real easy and you have to have help so let's just say that i'm hoping that i'm going to be able to show you something that will help you navigate my site there okay i was going to use the scoop but she says to roll into balls this one may be a little big it's it i'm gonna take a little off okay and as we roll them in the balls where i have preheated my oven to 375 degrees okay you know we love peanut butter cookies and to me the best peanut butter cookie i've ever had in my life was what they used to have in the school lunch rooms many years ago before i think they started making them cook healthier but it was so so good and uh we we love them still i have two different recipes that i use they're both different so this makes three if i ever do another cookbook which i'm hoping that i will i may put all three recipes in i would definitely give sharon credit for this one because she shared it with me but i believe it's going to be really good because it's this um eagle brand milk in here y'all hear me call it eagle brand that's what i always called it growing up but condensed to me okay i had done that then it says to take a fork and i've got it in some water a little bit so it won't uh stick and we're just gonna mash them i can't imagine these not being good i had several of you send me recipes and y'all i'm going to i will try them and tell you who sent them to me i don't make up all my recipes because many that i make was my mamas or harold's mamas but you know it may be some that you hadn't had because these that y'all were sending me or some i didn't have so we're just gonna see how these turn out got three more to do this and she says to cook them six to eight minutes but not to overcook so that's what i'm gonna do i put some parchment paper down you don't have to but it sure does make for an easier cleanup all right if you can see i'm gonna put these in the oven and in six to eight minutes i'll be back all right i cooked these eight minutes they look delicious i'm gonna take them off and put them on my rack to let them cool i can't wait to taste them we may let harold be the tester in just a minute and see what he says see they're they're brown on the bottom this looks like it would probably make about four to five dozen of this size cookie i'm not sure but i know it's going to make it least um four looks like anyway but while those cool just a second i'm gonna tell you that we're continuing to talk about love in in uh february this morning i was reading and and almost in all through the new testament it talks about love and if we don't have love we don't have jesus so that spoke to me there's somebody that you've got out against you better get it right i think but anyway i don't know which one come around here here where they can see now he's he's gonna be the first tester but i think i'm gonna do it too yeah mm-hmm good need some milk go to the refrigerator those are so good sharon i appreciate you sending me this recipe and i will post it above the video for all of you to try four ingredients you probably have those but anyway matthew 5 13-16 talks about salt and light and jesus says if the salt has lost its flavor it's good for nothing so he wants us to go out try to preserve the people who were lost tell them about him and to be light and shine for jesus i'll be back soon i love y'all share my page", "4Xj46QqCX_A": "this FINA butter cookie dough is eggless and made exclusively for eating without having to bake you will be able to be eating your sweet treat within minutes what is up you guys it is Carly here and you are officially cooking with Carly today's a cookie dough that we are making is a peanut butter cookie dough I know all of you live on the edge kind of people sneak cookie dough before you bake your peanut butter cookies in the oven today we are just skipping the oven step altogether and making cookie dough that is safe to eat and it tastes exactly like the real thing you will not be able to even tell the difference let's talk about our ingredients here it's basically what we would use for regular peanut butter cookies which is butter sugars both brown sugar and granulated sugar peanut butter salt vanilla and the two things that are slightly different here our milk and our flour we're using milk in place of the eggs and we're using heat treated flour to cover all of our bases you can heat treat your flour either using the oven or the microwave if you want to use your oven just toast it at 350 for five to ten minutes and with the microwave just toss it in there for about a minute minute and a half let your flour cool before making the rest of the recipe though to make the edible cookie dough we are just going to make it exactly like you would make your regular cookie dough the butter and peanut butter will go into the mixer first mix them all together nice and creamy and then the sugars will go in and again mix them until nice and creamy let's start out with the butter and peanut butter we have one half cup of each here but ur going in and peanut butter going into the mixer and I'm using a stand mixer here but you don't have to have a stand mixer you can definitely use an electric hand mixer if that's what you have my butter is softened here I pulled it out of the fridge and just tossed in the microwave for like 10 seconds if you have room-temperature butter that will work also let's do this thing while this is still mixing I'll just toss in my 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar oh I'm scared I've got a sign this now our liquids are going to go into the cookie dough regular cookie dough this is where the egg will come into play but we're not using eggs or substituting milk for those eggs so 1/4 cup of milk it's going into the mixer as well as 1 teaspoon of vanilla well mix this until it's nice and combined and then we'll add in our dry ingredients lastly the dry ingredients go in two cups of heat treated flour and then about three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt go in and let's mix this until it's combined and then our cookie dough is ready to eat before we mix this up do me a favor if you've enjoyed this video so far give me a thumbs up and subscribe to my youtube channel with a

people do think a lot of people prefer the dough I'm gonna go out on whim and say it alright let's get mixing it is complete our cookie dough is done it's ready to eat can I let you in on a little secret I actually like to put chocolate chips into my peanut butter cookie dough to make peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough and it is fabulous so maybe divided in half have some peanut butter and have some peanut butter chocolate chip because it is scrumdiddlyumptious I'm going to transfer this over to a clear bowl so you can see what it looks like what the texture should be it should just be exactly like a regular cookie dough nice and smooth and really tasty too let's talk about let's talk about different things that you can do with your cookie dough here you can eat it with a spoon and I definitely recommend eating it with a spoon you can also put it on top of ice cream like chocolate ice cream would be really good with this peanut butter cookie dough or you can make it into nice little tiny bite sized balls and then dip it in chocolate to make it like a peanut butter cookie dough truffle action that would be delicious for me what I generally do is I will roll them into balls and toss them into the fridge until they get nice and chilled and then put them into a zip-top bag and then store them in the fridge you'll want to store them in the fridge unless you are eating them the cookie dough will last in your fridge for you know five six seven days if it lasts that long at all because mine usually lasts like mmm a day if I'm looking while I'm rolling these I just wanted to remind you and let you know that I have I think 11 different types of cookie dough recipes on my website so if you are ever needing a cookie dough fix head to my website and look them up

to be showing you my peanut butter Hershey kiss cookies if you don't have her she kisses where you live you know these little they're wrapped in foil you can use any solid chocolate I've used of chocolates before when I didn't have Hershey Kisses this yeah this is my 11 year olds absolute favorite cookie he asks me for all the time so we're gonna start with a third of a cup of sugar and a third of a cup of brown sugar that goes in there and I'm going to add a half a cup of shortening [Music] I'm just gonna mix that up okay and then to this I'm going to add three quarters of a cup of creamy peanut butter and I've never tried it but I bet cashew butter or almond butter would work and taste really good okay get that mixed in and then to this I'm going to add one egg [Applause] two tablespoons of milk any kind I just have 1% here and one teaspoon of vanilla okay now for my dry ingredients I just need one and a half cups of all-purpose flour [Music] there's one and a half and then I need one teaspoon of soda baking soda and a half a teaspoon of salt let that go okay you're gonna let this go until all the dough pulls away from the sides my bowl is pretty clean and that means you've gotten it falls right off you've got the perfect if you could see in there at the ball it's just totally clean on the side so and that means we are good to go okay in here I've just got some granulated sugar and I'm gonna get my cookie sheet I'm gonna line it with some parchment paper you can also use cooking spray and I'm gonna roll these in I like them smaller I like more chocolate on the cookie like the chocolate chip peanut butter ratio I think is better with the smaller cookies so I'm going to roll them about one inch one inch balls that I'm in roll them in just some granulated sugar and they won't spread out a lot so you can put a lot on a cookie sheet I can fit fifteen or sixteen this is also something my kids love to help me with I'll get them to unwrap all the Hershey Kisses that takes a while and then they can help roll the balls and then they love to put the Hershey Kisses on when they come out of the oven she's got to be careful though the pen will be hot this is going to make about just depending on a good four dozen of tiny cookies or three dozen if you're gonna do them bigger okay this is gonna go in a 350 degree oven I'm gonna check it around seven or eight minutes you'll know they're done when they start to crack on top okay I have just barely pulled these out of the oven you can see how they've got the cracks on top there's still a little bit puffy and that's okay you need to work quickly definitely do this while the cookies are hot make sure you're watching if your kids are helping just be really careful I put a towel underneath the pan and I'm just gonna press it Hershey kiss right down in the middle and then I do like to let these cool off all the way before eating the chocolates gonna melt a little bit and be really messy if you like that that's fine I usually actually stick these in the fridge so then the chocolate sets back up or you can just leave them on the counter until they're how you like them and there you have it my friends thanks so much for being here with me today I hope you enjoyed this tutorial make sure to subscribe to my channel to see more content like this and you can find me on

and let's get into the recipes go get baked it support on patreon first bake it up to make your peanut butter cookies we're gonna start off by preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and then in a medium mixing bowl we're gonna whisk together some all-purpose flour baking soda baking powder and a little bit of salt and then we're just going to set that aside in the bowl of our stand mixer we're going to cream together some vegan butter some white sugar and brown sugar we want to beat that until it is nice and light and fluffy [Music] we're gonna add in our peanut butter and then mix on low until just blend it in and while it's still on low we're gonna add in our flax egg and vanilla [Music] once that's blended in we're going to keep that stand mixer on low and slowly beat in the flour mixture and you want to mix until just combined so as soon as you don't see any more dry flour you're gonna want to stop the mixer using a cookie scoop or a spoon or your hands scoop up some cookie dough and shape them into balls and then you're gonna place them on a lined baking sheet about two inches apart using a fork you're gonna flatten the cookies creating the iconic crisscross design then you're gonna bake those cookies one baking sheet at a time for about nine minutes when you remove them from the oven make sure to keep them on the baking sheet for about five minutes to cool and continue cooking on the baking sheet and then you can transfer them to a wire cooling rack and star these in an airtight container [Music] all right see how easy and look so classic look this is what I remember peanut butter cookies looking like they come out pre bitten this is like the exact look of a peanut butter cookie in my eyes this is the exactly peanut butter peanut butter cookies are one of those things that people try and make healthier a lot more it's like three ingredients you don't have to put sugar because the peanut butter makes up for a lot of stuff it doesn't it does in sugars especially brown sugar softens cookies so makes them nice and like pillowy and soft to bite it's important these are like perfectly soft right mm-hmm still got like a crispy bottom yeah this is why you're the master the master hey have you used just natural peanut butter or just peanuts the sugars not so bad because there's no sugar in the peanut butter either there we go everything's fine I mean you still a lot of sugar but everything's fine there's our cookie okay it definitely doesn't seem like we've had too many of these already today I think we're fine actually oh wait this is

thirty-two pouring with the friends okay", "Ae0hbAtvqdo": "so peanut butter keto cookies is what we're making today last year I did a low-carb keto version of the ever-popular three ingredient peanut butter cookie recipe and while that recipe is really easy and quite delicious I thought I could make a better keto peanut butter cookie these keto cookies are incredibly soft incredibly chewy incredibly delicious and incredibly easy from start to finish they take about 15 minutes to make it doesn't get much easier than this well that being said let's get right into the recipe make some delicious keto cookies all right so the first thing we're gonna do is preheat our oven to 350 degrees next we want to get out some eggs and we're gonna separate the yolks from the whites for today's keto peanut butter cookies we'll be using four eggs but we're just gonna be using the yolks of these eggs for our keto cookies so once we've got those separated we're gonna add them to a medium-sized bowl and then we'll want to get out the main ingredient to our low-carb keto cookies and that is some natural no sugar added peanut butter by the way make sure you use a runny peanut butter like this for your kiddo cookies otherwise they might turn out crumbly and dry instead of soft and chewy anyways for today's the low-carb cookie recipe I want to add about 2/3 of a cup which is about a hundred and sixty grams of that no sugar peanut butter to our bowl once we've done that we're gonna sweeten up our keto cookies and of course we'll want to do this without adding any carbs or calories and my favorite way to do that is by using confectioners worth with that being said to sweeten up today's peanut butter cookies we're gonna add a heaping half a cup or 80 grams of that stuff to our bowl so when that's taken care of we're gonna add one last dry ingredient to add a little bit of chewiness to our keto cookies and that is some blanched almond flour my favorite kind of use is this one by Kirkland's because it's cheap and it only has two net carbs per serving having said that we're gonna use 1/2 a cup or 56 grams of it for our low-carb peanut butter cookies today oh and we'll also want to add a heaping teaspoon of vanilla extract to add a tiny shot of flavor to our peanut butter cookies as well now at this point we want to get out a spatula and mix everything together until a thick cookie dough batter forms once that happens like to use my hands to shape the dough into a ball of cookie dough like this and collect any straggling pieces now we're all set to get out a cookie scoop and start forming our peanut butter keto cookies by the way my cookie scoop is about the size of a tablespoon and just so you know this keto cookie recipe will make about eleven tablespoons sized cookies so when we've got those added to our baking sheet lined with parchment paper that's why you can get out a fork and give our low-carb peanut butter cookies their classic cross marked pattern when we've added that CROSSMARK pattern to all the cookies that's when we can go ahead and get those in the oven and the great thing about this recipe is that these peanut butter cookies only take about seven minutes to bake however when they are done baking you'll want to let them cool down completely in the tray itself and this is just because they'll need some time to set once they do cool down and set them this is what they end up looking like check this out look how soft and chewy these peanut butter keto cookies are they are so delicious I cannot wait for guests to try them is always

cup of flour and my soda and salt mix in a little bit at a time here let that sugar and butter start doing its thing absorbing that flour okay okay that's just about mixed in just until you barely see any more flour then you can stop okay now to that i'm going to add in my one-half cup of quick oats it's a half a cup half a cup of quick oats and here i'm just kind of tossing and pressing folding it over that way i don't do a whole lot of stirring now i got one cup of chocolate chips i like semi semi sweet chocolate chips that's one cup [Applause] one cup i'm sorry guys if you hear anything in the back my son's back there playing his video game okay so now we'll get this mixed up and i've made these and i i haven't chilled the dough then there's times i have chilled the dough but today it's kind of warm in the house i am in texas so and that's it i basically just get the chips mixed in everything's incorporated i could eat that stuff just like that but but anyways tempting i'm gonna stick it in the freezer maybe 15 minutes and we'll be back alrighty i chilled it for 15 minutes more firm now you can use an ice cream scoop for these um i like to i can't believe i still haven't uh purchased one shame on me right but i have my lined uh cookie sheet here with some parchment paper now when i don't have my cookies my grandbabies my granddaughters they like to get into my stuff and play bake you know they use all my utensils and grandma can't tell them no and they end up in their toy boxes outside so it's like i'm gonna have to buy some and hide them from them or something but what i'm i could use the tablespoon and just drop them on there but i like to just drop them in my little quarter cup like that and i like that kind of rustic look when you take it up either like the ice cream scoop will give you then i'll just bring it down flip it over on the rounded side and just kind of shape it on itself but if you got an ice cream scoop just use that it's just how i'm doing it i don't want to get it all over my hands but i'm going to get these on the cookie sheet guys and we're going to get us some cookies going all right i got them on there i'm just going to pat them down just a little not too much because they are going to spread some guys and we don't want super i don't want super thin cookies just pat them down some now you're gonna cook these until they lightly brown around the edges i'll let you know how long mine take it's usually probably between 11 to 13 minutes but i'll let you guys know but we're gonna pop them in the oven okay my friends mine cooked for 12 minutes now on these i wanted to show you what i like to do because i love chocolate i'll let them set here maybe four to five minutes then i'll pierce them let them finish flattening out that's what they'll do and then you can pierce them with a few chips and those chips will get nice and soft but let them set before you do that let them you know deflate i guess you would say because they kind of sink after they set that's why i said don't press them too hard but i'm gonna um like i said mine cooked for 12 minutes and then on this hot cookie sheet of course they continue to cook let them cool a good four to five minutes on the sheet and then you can pierce them with some some more chips and then you can go ahead and remove them and get them on your cooling rack but i got some more to bake up and we'll get them set up all righty my friends there they are cool down and ready to eat and one's already missing and they are delicious but um my second um i had two more to bake because i got a dozen out of mine but by all means you can get two cookies out of that one-quarter cup you know you can actually get two dozens but you'll have to adjust your cooking time just keep an eye on them but um like i said our ovens are different keep an eye on them don't over bake them um make them the size you'd like minor quarter cup size they took the second batch took uh 11 minutes and the first one took i believe i said 13 and the cookies do spread so spread them out pretty well um but uh i hope you guys give these a try and let me know what you think and until then happy holidays once again guys and god bless and like and subscribe as always and we will see you guys next time bye [Music] you", "YfHD_e3oC9M": "having been raised in South Side of Chicago I went to the Chicago Public Schools when I was younger before my mom put me into Catholic schools and one of my fondest memories believe it or not was they the peanut butter cookies that the Chicago public system school system had and those cookies were so good and over the years I have tried every way possible to find that cookie recipe and I have not been successful until just recently and I got a recipe from a lady by the name of Freda gamble and I do believe she's right I believe this is the recipe because I've made them and they taste just like that just filled up my brain with childhood memories so what we start with is five sticks of butter or you're going to need 1 and 1/4 pound same thing you're going to need 3 eggs and I would say to use 3 large eggs and get them at room temperature I'm going to use a little bit of my Mexican vanilla but any vanilla will do I just like my Mexican vanilla you're going to need a pound of peanut butter you could use the chunky or the creamy of course the ladies in the old lunch room only use the creamy then you go to need brown sugar what we're going to need there for brown sugar is 1 and 3/4 cup baking soda any type but you have as a teaspoon of baking soda sugar you're going to need 1 and 3/4 cup of sugar and then we're going to need 3/4 teaspoon of salt and we're going to mix this up and we are going to make some dynamite dynamite peanut butter cookies good lord I cannot forget that I'm going to have to have white flour well you could use a mixture white flour and wheat flour too but we need about 5 and a half cups of flour for this recipe this recipe is going to produce nine dozen peanut butter cookies put your butter in a ball and you mix it until the butter gets nice and fluffy now according to the recipe we put in two and a half cups of sugar and it said slowly but I don't have time for all that and you know what I make delicious so here we go two and a half cups the sugar now let that blend up and then I'll put in the brown sugar now a lot of new people don't know that when you measure brown sugar you should push down on it and make sure that it's firm that's how you measure one in 3/4 cup brown sugar you do not measure loosely it has to be very dense and brown sugar we're going to have 1 and 3/4 cup now in case you don't have brown sugar you take a little bit of molasses and you put it in the white sugar until you find what you like ok I'm using the light brown sugar this time but you can use a dark brown sugar all that is is a little bit more molasses so now add your brown sugar nice pick a nap if you're gonna happen to me there you go you know this thing that they have is an attachment that you pay about twenty bucks or it's really more of a pain in the butt than its work and as you see it's all blended up we want it to get nice mixed up so let's just keep up three minutes okay keep scraping the sides down I'm going to add two teaspoons of my vanilla oh there's always so much better and then we're going to crack the eggs in here of one at a time now with the way I'd crack eggs I don't tend to have shells but just for the video I'm going to crack them one at a time and drop them in there Joe no I cannot stand mixing up everything and all kinds of different things so I'll do that with each edge egg number to put that all in part break egg three there you go stop the blender lift it up make sure you scrape down the sides you want to keep doing that I notice there's a new attachment for this that you don't have to do this anymore so let's see if I can't purchase that it's just a wider blade with some rubber on the end why they didn't just make that one to begin what this is not a cheap blender buy anyway when it's totally incorporated you're just going to bring it back up and I'm going to put all my peanut butter in there the whole jar so I cleaned out the whole jar peanut butter and I put it in the blender with all my eggs and sugars and that the only thing that in here yet is the flour we're going to bring that up that's all nice and blended and make sure that you keep breaking down the side and there's only one way to tell looks beautiful oh good cookies so now I'm going to put the flour in here so I need to make sure that I'm going to use a wooden spoon or a plastic spoon for this process putting in the flour because this gets very very thick and I don't want to room the motor I'm a new machine I want to show you what my good friend Tammy got me and why I was inspired to make these cookies in the first place it's a one gallon canning jar for cookies I mean it's a cookie jar but does she know me or what a canning jar oh I think that is the best I love it so now what we need is like five and a half cups of flour and once again I remember I watch my grandma and that they didn't get all nutty pie for some reason what pie crust they used to do all that sifting but here's one cup I'm going to go ahead and put in about three cups and then I'll mix that all up and then I'll add the other two and a half cups there you go yeah I hear it all the time but you didn't slip your flour well my flour was nice to begin with this makes a lot of cookies people and I'll put in another one too there we go in all preppin means more than just putting food in a closet forgetting you have it and it means about making sure you get enough toothpaste and my church recommends you have enough to survive on your own for at least a year so I think there's something to that and then you should have half and you know it depends on humidity I'm going to say that's about a half and I made these before so it's getting very hard very hard so we're going to go ahead and we're going to ball this up come on I'd say about a tablespoon depends if you want big cookies have big cookies I just take a bunch out like that roll it in a ball and now this made just for this one tray I'm just going to put 16 cookies on it because they are going to swell up and they are going to stretch now what you're going to do is take a fork dip it in the flour and you're going to go down on the cook two ways alright after a few times it won't stick just real lightly push down on your cookie there you go see how fast this gets going now these look like they're little mini throw in your mouth one bites but in reality these are going to swell up so they're going to get so you see how I did that now you do that with the rest of them when you're done doing that put them in the oven at 375 for 10 to 11 minutes to see how those swelled up you're beautiful and this is the first batch that's out that's beautiful and look at these with those little candies aren't they cute notes right into it it's adorable look I nice those came out and that's the parchment paper after 4 dozen cookies or 4 batches of 16 cookies you see how nice one sheet of parchment paper is it saves your band okay I made seven batches of 16 cookies seven batches of them in each batch had 16 cookies and look them are nice size cookies the mini one bite and I still have all this leftover so I'm going to make a log I'm going to put it in wax paper and I'm going to put it in the frigerator because I'm tired and you see you have the big enough row just like in the refrigerated section at your store and you know how much you pay for that wrapped it up and I'll be able to make cookies towards the end of the week if I want to if I wanted to do this long term I just stick it in the freezer and these are but not you", "YbbSLtz76OY": "if someone asks me which cookies I

cup of Nutella half a cup of peanut butter 1 egg and 1 cup of all-purpose flour those are the ingredients so let's get started okay so for our first step I'm gonna get our beautiful Nutella into our Bowl okay next our nice peanut butter okay and then we will get our egg in there grab my mixer and now I really want to mix this up well okay that's good and then we'll grab our flour and we'll sift that in a really really simple recipe perfect grab my mixer again and I'm just gonna slowly incorporate all this together I do have my oven set to 350 degrees okay so at this point you can see this mixture is rather dry and what I want to do is I want to add just a little bit of moisture so I'm gonna add a little bit of water so I'm gonna add in tablespoon of water we'll just mix this in and this is optional but if you do see that your batter is a little bit dry you can add a little bit of water and that will help out it does not change this recipe in any bad way okay that's good and now we'll go get our pan ready okay I've got a medium-sized little scoop here and I'm just gonna flip these up and get them right onto my tray my oven is set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit then I'm just gonna take the back of a spoon and I just want to push these down a little bit which is going to keep all of the mixture together and it's also gonna allow these to bake a little bit quicker in the oven I'm gonna pop these into my 350 degree oven around 15 minutes I'm gonna bake these off and the rest of these and I'll come back and show you the final product all right I'm back and I baked my Nutella peanut butter cookies for a total of 15 minutes at that 350 degree mark now if you make your cookies a little bit smaller then you're gonna want to cook these or bake them rather for you know about maybe 12 minutes depends on the size so my cookies are quite warm still so what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna let these cool down and then come back and I'll show you one okay my cookies have cooled quite a bit and let's just break into one and I'll just show you really really nice you can see that they're still moist inside just listen no crack which is nice and there we go oh that's good

please give me a thumbs up subscribe if you wish I do appreciate it that's it for this video and I'll see you next time well that is good mm-hmm I like that you", "CuvPvaXP9d8": "happy new year everyone we are gonna start the year off with peanut butter cookies because why not they are soft chewy and as always vegan and gluten free alright so we are gonna start by making a flax egg all you need to do is make some flax seed meal and water and let the mixture set for about 10 minutes I make my own flax seed meal in a Vitamix but you can use store-bought flax seed meal as well the main ingredient in these cookies is of course peanut butter there's always a discussion over which peanut butter is best I use organic natural smooth peanut butter with peanuts being the only ingredient make sure that the peanut butter is at a room temperature I'll explain why in a little bit the next ingredients are coconut sugar maple syrup coconut oil vanilla extract and the flax egg we prepared earlier coconut sugar is a great sweetener for soft cookies because it's hygroscopic meaning that it absorbs moisture from the air producing soft and moist cookies as you can see I'm using liquid coconut oil so make sure all your ingredients are at a room temperature so the coconut oil doesn't solidify as you are mixing the peanut butter with the maple syrup and the flag's egg you'll notice that the mixture is becoming thicker and thicker this is because the peanut butter ceases when it's mixed with water-based ingredients that's okay though we want the mixture to thicken up the last few ingredients are oat flour again I grind my own oat flour in a Vitamix baking powder baking soda and a pinch of sea salt mix all the ingredients until everything is well combined using a two tablespoon ice cream scoop scoop and drop cookie dough balls onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet allow for some room for the cookies to spread because they well spread a little bit I usually use two baking sheets putting eight cookies on each of them using a fork slightly press down to flatten the cookies turn the fork and press down on the cookies again to create a crisscross pattern on the top bake the cookies until slightly cold and brown around the edges which will take about 10 to 12 minutes the cookies will be soft when you take them out of the oven but they will firm up as they cool and that's it soft and chewy peanut butter cookies that are both vegan and gluten free we have tested a lot of peanut butter cookies we have stacks of peanut butter cookies on the counter and channa has been eating them for the past week so we started with like three ingredient peanut butter cookie and that was a know then four ingredient peanut butter cookie that was a no and now this recipe has more ingredients but Jenna likes this one we've captured the taste free but the peanut butter taste is coming through very evidently as well as that's sweet over hi across the palate cookies deliver so what our sweetener is maple syrup and coconut sugar coconut sugar and it does a job so nicely like I would probably prefer these over your standard peanut butter cookies hmm hey because I assume they're healthier assuming that I'm okay they're the envy because the typical peanut butter that you might use for peanut butter cookies is generally full of some regular peanut butters so it's it has additional oils and sugar yes so like craft peanut butter yes yeah necessarily the most nutritious mm-hmm and there's a lot of sugar in that recipe they're tasty but these are healthier and they they capture the same flavor so I would go with these and give it a try because your kids will love you for it and you yourself will be thanked so I hope you enjoy this video if you did please give me

we'll just give this a good mix now we'll put the flour mixture in with the peanut butter mixture and we'll mix this until it's well combined but don't over mix it until it looks like this now we're going to take up on a tablespoon of the mixture and place it on a baking tray we'll give these a pat-down to flatten them and make sure there are some spades between each of the cookies next we'll take a fork and we'll make a nice little crisscross pattern just for effect now we'll slip these into a preheated oven set at about 350 degrees for about 15 minutes and after about 15 minutes we've

today we're going to be making peanut butter cookies so I hope you guys enjoy this video and I apologize that lately that my last three Easy Bake Oven videos have involved peanut butter so the next one I promise will not involve peanut butter and yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video okay so let's go start the baking so first we're going to add in our peanut butter and the instructions where I got this recipe from just say to add in everything all at once so that's what we're going to do so first I'm going to add my peanut butter and then some brown sugar baking powder should get all of it out and butter and make sure your butter is softened and then 1/4 cup of flour and then I'm just going to add a few drops of vanilla okay that should be enough until so now I'm just going to mix this up okay so now I have it all mixed in and that looks kind of like a cookie butter but it's still a little bit crumbly which is kind of odd but we'll try it out tonight three little balls in here and now I'm just going to use a fork and then just make a little crosshatch pattern like a cook like a regular peanut butter cookie okay and they're a rookies so I'm just going to put this in my oven for 10 minutes so here they are okay so I'll come back when it's ready okay so the timer just went off and I apologize for not getting footage of the timer going up like I usually do but I'm just going to take them out now and make sure using the pan pusher to push them and take down by the way so let's what they look like so here's what they look like put them down so this is what we made today and they're super cute and adorable and they're pretty good I tried them already and my only criticism is that they're a little bit crumbly and so is the batter to mix so it's a little bit hard to mix it takes a little while but other than that they're pretty good and it makes nine cookies total but I couldn't picture all them here because I wouldn't all fit in the baking rack and I would bake them on the longer side of 10 minutes so maybe like 11 minutes but other than that they're really good and I would recommend you guys trying out this recipe so I hope you guys enjoy this video bye",

a bowl no mixer required cream together one stick of unsalted butter at room temperature with one cup light brown sugar firmly packed this is a nice cookie dough just to make try to think back to childhood when mom used to make these identical cookies it's those cookies with the little fork marks in the top and now one large egg and half a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and in another bowl you're going to sift your dry ingredients get the egg incorporated it smells so good already just try to make sure that there are no lumps of the brown sugar left now add 1 cup of smooth peanut butter Americans consume enough peanut butter in one year to make over 10 billion peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that's a lot of peanut butter runner peanuts are preferred for making peanut butter for their uniform size they are grown primarily in Georgia Alabama and Florida peanuts are a member of the legume family they're a good source of protein the average American child will eat 1,500 peanut butter sandwiches by the time he graduates from high school pretty sticky now sift your dry ingredients 1 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour some baking soda 1 teaspoon make sure your baking soda is fresh and a little bit of salt 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt and sift these ingredients just once and incorporate the dry into the peanut butter mixture a little bit at a time and stir just until the flour is incorporated so there it's all done wrap this in a piece of plastic wrap pre-heat your oven about a half an hour before you bake your cookies to 350 degrees I already have some dough chilled and my oven is already preheated just put this in and take the other out now you can also if you're a nice mother have this in the refrigerator when the kids come home from school have the cookie sheets already prepared nothing is easier than cookie sheets these days because we have these wonderful sill pad pads this eliminates any need for greasing the pan and the cookie dough can just be rolled as if it were clay dough or a play dough into 1-inch rounds and you get approximately 15 cookies per sheet space them approximately 2 inches apart now press each round down slightly with the palm of your hand and now dip your fork into flour and press the fork the tines of the fork into the top of each cookie first in one direction and then if you wish crisscross my mother always made a crisscross pattern in her cookies and you bake them in your preheated oven for approximately 10 to 12 minutes or until they're just golden not brown we have something just ready to come out here they are transfer them to a rack to cool they're buttery they're tender you're old-fashioned and they're made out of peanut butter you", "oteZuV5tA4k": "[Music]", "SYULJD36Vco": "pillow family of a puppy

A while ago i did a cookie in a mug and most people seem to love that\nso im going to follow up with a different version that's just as delish So join me today as i make my version of a peanut butter cookie in a mug. To start of with into a regular size cup we're going to place in a tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of peanut butter. And the ingredients are listed in\nthe description and we are going to place this into the microwave for say thirty seconds at a time string just until completely dissolved\nand mixed well together Now that its melted we are going to place in a tablespoon of brown sugar Now if you can't find brown sugar check out the link down below where i show you how to make your own. Then to that one tablespoon of white sugar, then a pinch of salt and a couple of drops of vanilla extract and three tablespoons regular\nall purpose flour and the yolk of one egg and mix it through until its well\ncombined okay so this is the consistency you're after a moist firm consistency, so just push it down just so its nice and even. And as one final optional step i've got some crushed peanuts\nhere I'm going to place on top Now I'm going to place this in the microwave for forty five seconds on high but all microwaves are different, so if its undercooked or over cooked just simply adjust your microwave by five seconds okay so i have just taken it out of the microwave and look at that and its smells delicious. So from start to\nfinish it took me no more then three minutes to make. It is super simple and easy But lets see what its like look at that oh yummy.

need a nap assessor okay so um I have something to say about cooking here for a moment so today we are making peanut butter cookies on page 279 and dining iodine cookbook just right there Mike's fine-dining cookbook page 279 now these are not the three ingredient recipes these are the old-fashioned cookies like grandma used to make but I will tell you they really do taste a lot better than three ingredient cookies sorry all you three ingredient cookie fans I know you love them and they're really good but these are and they're good don't get me wrong I make them but these are just a little bit fluffier [Music] myk's myk's lifting and listen to the the team though of health can you guys see the tingle of health happening there yep they can see it on the camera okay poor Linda she said it's 106 heat index 95 mmm Oh have mercy okay now I will say the only reason why I am it is it seriously reading okay can you go take the fan out of the car for me um the only reason why I'm making peanut butter cookies today is because it's 70 degrees here today to turn on the oven so I was gonna turn on the oven because I was like there's no way I'm doing this okay so now I have a thing to say about cooking so we're coming over here let's see if that's good I can't tilt here let me come me the Kim okay there I think I got it now can you see me oh the lights in the way okay great yeah okay so I have to explain something people I expect they're holding the light up like this people need baking to applicated you need to make your baking easy now I love baking and the reason why I love baking is because I make it easy for myself and how do I do that I keep all of my baking supplies all in one place so I wanted to show you guys this so you can see so can you see in here Dave okay so right here is my mixing bowls and measuring cups okay I have them right here then I have all my cocoa powder my spray oils my dry milk my yeast I have five salts in my kitchen my kitchen is about 20 by 20 maybe not even that big 20 by 15 maybe I don't know it's not very big and I have five salts in my kitchen one in my baking Center two on the stove with different tops for different amounts depending on what I'm cooking and one on the table and one with my spices why do I do that I have fibromyalgia I'm not going to go walking all over creation to get stuff out of the cabinets to bake so then yes yes you may and then I have my bit of my powdered sugars and my brown sugars here's all my cookie cutters my muffin tins my food colorings my dried buttermilk cake mixes my mixer goes here then oh here I got a joke for you guys to prepare I'll do my job and so then down here I have my sugar and my flowers not here because I have the show but my flower and my sugar are here baking powder baking soda all that my baking spices cinnamon allspice cloves ginger baking spices are all here everything is right here and it's not even 18 inches to my refrigerator the reason I do that is I don't have my flour over in my pantry on the other side of the kitchen I don't have my mixing bowls on the other side kitchen everything is right here so that I can just pull it down in one motion pull it down open it put my cocoa in put it straight back that is what helps make baking and cooking a whole lot easier it's you need to set your kitchen up to have your areas so like this is my baking area and then I have all my spices not in alphabetical order whoever created that system for spices is out of their mind who uses allspice first but all spices at the very front that's like the one time of year you use allspice put your onion powder your garlic powder everything at the front they can use more often okay so make it convenient for yourself so that's my little lecture so here I have a little joke for you guys Mike and I found this says one more payment and it's ours oh three more payments ours and then this one is so relevant still for Colorado we finally found a place we can afford that not true Michael sent me this eight years ago and it still holds true today Colorado is ridiculous okay so now I'm back over here I just wanted to explain that to you guys because the problem is people say oh I hate thinking it's just so complicated and all this and it's not it you shake it yeah you make it complicated when you don't need it to be it usually takes me five minutes to whip up a batch of cookies seriously five minutes is all takes so anyway that's why I can't wait to get a kitchen for a studio because this is driving me crazy hauling stuff back and forth and yeah okay Shirley's asking how to get the dining on a dime cookbook okay can you tell her for a moment while I take it up yes surely I'm about to paste a link into the comments for our Christmas in July sale and you can get our dining on a done cookbook right there on our website and 25% off right now some things are 50% off but dining on a dime is 25 so yay right there all right are you guys ready here we go so in here I have my brown sugar my sugar my shortening and I added margarine why did I add margarine cuz I ran out of shortening then I went to the store this morning that's even funnier okay there's a thing called a shopping list I mean have your husband pick it up okay say that before you do shows the stuff you're supposed to look and see if you actually have all the ingredients but I don't know what that means okay so margarine shortening brown sugar and my sugars are all in here so I'm going to cream these together can you see Dave [Music] [Music] all right got that so now I'm gonna add my peanut butter oh yeah tonight we're with the homestead Network go to D homestead Network comm if you guys want to find a whole bunch of great youtubers but teach all kinds of things we got Kanner's we've got gardeners on there everybody's on there go check out the homestead Network ah alright so um I have my peanut butter and my eggs and my vanilla I just love my new little look at this is this not the cutest thing ever see and then it's the measuring cup I just died when I thought okay so then my baking soda yeah I had a little bit of a baking soda was missing my baking stuff actually the older kids took my baking soda into the bathroom they're using it as a to scrub and my salt oops I forgot something got my salt in there so I mix all this up first and then I add my flour [Music] [Music] but then if she wanted to get something she'd have to go out to the car and dig under seats in the charger all right here's another tip I keep my flour and my sugar I keep a 1 cup measure in my flour and I keep a 1/2 cup measure in my sugar and then I always can measure the right amount and I don't have to get another measuring thing dirty ok so then just get this all mixed up yeah I don't do well with my phone it's yeah the other day I had the car accident and two weeks ago and I had no phone I had no paper no pen the football was right we're dogs who the cell phone was where it belongs at home on the counter so here I was writing the lady's license-plate number down with lipstick I found for my show makeup that I left in the car on a box that I had from the books being delivered to the post office Oh have mercy on my soul that was crazy all right so you want your oven on at 375 Oh Katherine was wondering if because we were sitting backwards for normal if I was gonna make cookies I could've done that oh yeah let's see Mike make peanut butter cookies oh well I make I make a little that's true you do mike is not a peanut butter fan by any stretch of the imagination he hates peanut butter but that's okay I still love you like chocolate don't you yes I love chocolate okay now I like using this Silpat if you want you could use a piece of parchment paper and just reuse it every time better I hope so I don't know no they're homemade and I love my Silpat mom uses parchment paper so use whatever you want to use you just roll little balls and put them on your baking tray oh and today I remember my watermelon pickles I made two weeks ago guys I have them and I'm going to show them to you uh-huh because they're done so just make your little balls like this well we have some birthdays for the year what yeah birthdays this is a great birthday week don't you agree dear yes I think this is the bird best birthday week of the whole year it is I'm sure it is what do you think I think it is yes it is definitely you hesitated sorry I was thinking to come in I was reading in the sink okay so then you put them on your hold on a second I am but I got a big mess here that if I put it in its gonna get all over my stove okay so then just dip your fork and flour if you want although I don't usually and just push down oh and you have your yeah the flour keeps it from sticking but I never get enough flour that it really does much you know what wait a minute I'm gonna flat knees just a little bit I forgot I flattened them okay and then just like this and then oops forgot one tada whoa those looks super spectacular yes some people I don't usually but some people do also a very light sprinkling of sugar on top if you want I don't do that normally I just make them like it is but here's how you do that if you want we'll do the first one with sugar and then the second one hmm Oh Mary says I see you're wearing your Christmas apron Christmas in July oh [Music] that's a good idea yeah so my friend Mary from church she does water instead of flour that's a great idea okay mother's not quite okay so then you're gonna want to cook them for 10 minutes and there you go so while that is happening I gotta show you guys a couple of things so first here's my watermelon pickles now notice anything about these watermelon pickles look like peaches well they do look like peaches but if you will note the day I made watermelon pickles I had two full jar hmm this is all I have left did the mice get them they called my name resist so I've been eating on them for a week because I just these are like one of my favorite foods ever [Music] yeah oh sweet pickles hi aren't they good extra protein in there so this is what they look like watermelon twinkles guys so there you go all right so I'm going to show you my deals I got this week we're cutting back on the number of videos that we're gonna start doing yeah can you believe I'm actually saying no for what because I'm tired I mean which ones well we're gonna stop doing so many Tuesday and Thursday ones so I'm gonna start showing you guys my deals and stuff on the show yes I did set the timer so

carpet cleaning like car carpets today so I hope it any said the sale it's only healthy if he doesn't buy it for me I was gonna buy it for myself pretty sure she's insulting you someone burgers it's so cheap and so worth it yeah I'm not sure but there's something in the citric acid in the baking soda that makes me feel better with the aspirin so for those who don't know that's how he uses it when her chronic fatigue syndrome is getting bad yeah like last night I was really really sick when I went to bed but I had already taken a pain medicine so I couldn't take aspirin so I drink a half a teaspoon of baking soda in some water and that helped me feel better so this is like so jealous it's like seven inches from the Sun on here that's what a great way to describe it it's like I've seen

Stephen's Day says Debbie it's Anthony's Stephen leicht martyred Stephen in the Bible well I would assume that what these ain't Stephen yeah yeah well since it doesn't say st. Stephen some other something or there else st. Stephen the gardener yeah yes probably st. Stephen that was murdered in the Bible or State Stephen well okay oh no so we had actually one we don't have a name for well the see penny says Tanner Lynn her granddaughter and Alex said his grandmother who's 90 I love your videos and so does my grandma today is her birthday 90th birthday and Brenda says my nephew is with me you'll be 33 tomorrow on but on the autism spectrum E's nephew Alex is grandma who else and Brenda's nephew Brenda's nephew Alex's grandma Penny's granddaughter Tanner Lynn okay birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday [Music] Jekel at the candle for you guys oh my Dave give me a tilt down did you step in there there you go there it looks like you stuff somebody in there when you around the stage seems like I've never seen a Western in my life I don't know what you're talking about alright so this is my other today so Jamie my friend and youtuber found me the best deal ever so I love smoked turkey legs and I mean I love them I could eat it for every single meal but of course when you pay 750 or $8 at the fair you're not going to be eating a turkey leg every day so I get one turkey leg once a year they go to the Renaissance Festival yeah and we pay too much for growing her minute okay all I'll ask I'll answer your mint question just it so Jamie yesterday went to the grocery store and look what she found for me she found on clearance so I'm gonna throw these in the freezer and then cook me one once every week or so or two or three I don't know how long I have how many turkey legs so I end up getting Jamie one two three four five six seven eight nine ten turkey legs Wow look at that 282 is that not a great deal no that's three that is a great deal or is that upside down this they're well they're different sizes so this one's 385 this was 332 so I have all different sizes isn't that glorious yes I have to show you guys my turkey legs okay this is cookie perfection all right guys what do you think does that look luscious or what you know even though I don't like peanut butter they smell great oh you're not allergic to peanut oh yeah so Debbie so st. Stephen's Day or the feast of st. Stephen is Christian saints day to commemorate Saint Stephen first Christian martyr for protomatter I'm not sure what that word is but celebrated on the 26th of December in the Latin Church in 27th of December in Eastern Christianity No so it is the st. Stephen we were talking about okay well they said that it's a day when you who said it when you Patti says you take goodies to your neighbours in boxes the day after Christmas Oh seriously is that way it's called Boxing Day yeah here I thought all the all the teenage boys got to get all their frustrations out on their brothers Oh jack Sharon says not not Amos a mosquito okay now you can on these cookies if you wanted to have like a peanut butter cup you could add chocolate chips which is de very delicious too so I didn't get um so I didn't put P I didn't put chocolate in here because I didn't know who was gonna be eating them so I'm gonna make some more while I answer questions what is cat lovers question babe okay so tell me what your problem is with your mint because it could be several things mints take mint yes you may may be really hot be careful Pam's hot sorry I didn't want you bring yourself they're really hot so let them cold we might blow it mint takes a lot of water it is a very high water herb it it's not a low water herb it likes to spread out but it does well in pots but if you have it in the garden be prepared that it is gonna spread all over the place and I mean it will go all over the place especially if it has water so now we know your specific problem with it it does attract spider mites so if you're having a spider mite issue get some dish soap and some water and put it in a spray bottle like it I don't know a couple tablespoon of dish soap his spray bottle blogger it's just the douse the plant with that mixture spray it on there make sure you get all the leaves and everything yes delicious and then respray it every 3 to 4 days for like 2 weeks and that should kill the spider mites yes we have mosquitoes here in Colorado although thankfully they haven't really been that bad this year sometimes they're really bad other times they're not oh man it's shocking considering how wet it has been here too yes mitt can turn into a weed very even though it does smell really good is it good dad Jack this is very very delicious join Maurice watches from the beautiful Pacific Northwest have it having a rough day oh sorry it's a rough day but guys it's beautiful there um dear we heard that Ramona wants to know are they soft cookies yes the shortening it or and or margarine is what makes them soft so if you want them crunchy you can use butter instead since then we used to get these in elementary school to crisscross design on top that's pretty standard for peanut butter cookies right it's kind of a little fashion thing oh are you ready for more man that's really good okay sorry sorry Timmy nephew but well Mike is getting me questions um I'm trying to decide if I should get an air fryer or an insta pot insta pot it's instant pot whatever it's called so if you guys have some of those let me know I'm trying to decide if I should buy one or not go ahead so Karen says I want a cookie other people were talking about cookies and milk and all sorts of things now Ellison is asking everyone who likes the soap ad liners have never used them you like it don't you I love it mom I like it too I like it because you don't really have to scrape the baking pan so much if you accidentally burn something on my job so much easier Mike's parchment paper for cookies better she just folds it up I like the Silpat because I can use it for other things like toffee taffy fudge those kinds of things I can put those on there and they don't stay you can just pull them off hard candies like like sucker type yeah like peppermints Christmas candies those kinds of things Kelly wants to know what's for dinner well it was supposed to be green chilly what's this you're not feeling well maybe we should go to analysis so it was supposed to be green chilly and I didn't get the chicken out of the freezer I forgot okay come over and tell them what you think don't know whatever on there peanut butter cookies that's why don't you like peanut butter bTW just carrying on dangling actually someone was asking if Dave likes peanut butter no not really I don't like it Linda says you can have one turkey mm I don't think so that won't last that long I'm thinking one a week because that's like four servings of Turkey so that'll last me a few days mm-hmm where wasn't that you got the world's particular scheme Pro King Soopers and what was so funny was Dave and I were out shopping yesterday and we had just left sprouts because somebody said they had him there and they had no idea what I was talking about and Jamie called me on the phone while we were just leaving that storage she said guess what I just found because when I went to pick him up from her she said yeah I just happened to see it on Tuesday and tomorrow so I know and here I was just looking I literally we hadn't even been five minutes and I'm gonna miss a place yeah so Heather says great looking cookies I'll have to make them for hubby he loves peanut butter cookies you know even though I don't like peanut butter I know that most people do and that it's awesome am i defective and I'm not a peanut people are talking about all the storage you did in there and they were loving I said I have a hutch from my baking needs pins baking cabinet to keep it all together he keeps everything in mason jars which must be might be asset that would be fun I would love to keep everything in mason jars that would be so cool internet said I stole Tupperware many moons ago we were trained to set up the cabinets in centers I even making Center and Breakfast Center etc that's exactly what I do was just right here Frank Lin says try the airfryer it's the bomb so here's the thing I am so sick of cleaning up frying pans from frying stuff Oh uh-uh they're not good but he's taking two more camera boy BJ had an eight-hour night sleep the other day Oh 50 woke up saying he felt like he'd been hit with a brick like yeah but you know I told him I said a lot of people when they're having lack of sleep and they actually start sleeping they feel worse before they feel better okay oops let's see where were we Bendis oh sorry go ahead Brenda was saying about the shopping list I started writing juggling this on my fridge I put a big piece of chalk board contact paper try doesn't have a picture of it at least once a day so if I get how to have a crib it's not a smart idea if I actually kept my tea I send myself an email on the phone well when we keep a shopping list on the fridge it's just I don't ever remember to write it on there and then I forget the shopping list and I'm usually calling home saying what's on the list I'm at Walmart yeah Kathleen says I ordered some ebooks and today I ordered the print version of Diana died me just mention uShip yesterday's orders when we use it today's I shipped everything that had been ordered at 1:30 this afternoon had been shipped so it shortly before the show yeah so if you I was literally running to the post office before the show if you ordered after 1:30 today I will ship them tomorrow I just read the link for the Christmas okay yeah so when we have a sale I ship I try to ship every day if I can Janine's as my British hubby things peanut butter is an abomination I love peanut butter my being English thing like hitting ice tea funny I don't know I don't know for exactly why I don't like it I had this memory of it making me horribly sick when I was younger and now I smell it it just makes me so the thing about the air fire and the insta pot is I really don't want to turn on the our air conditioner does not keep up we got too small of an air conditioner in this house we but when we got it and if I turn on the oven in the summer art it won't go below 80 even with the air conditioner on and most days it won't go below 77 even with the air conditioner on and a lot of days if it's like a hundred and something degrees it'll won't go below 80 even though I have it on so I was thinking maybe the insta pot in the fryer the air fryer would be an easier way to cook in the summer without turning on the oven it makes rice in eight minutes Wow that is really good I would like that a lot that's what I was thinking the rice cooker to go save it and come back again soon yeah because my keys rice to perfect this I don't have counter space to set this stuff and let it just sit on my counter to use it all the time I don't know where I would keep it that's my biggest problem is I have no counter space to just keep it stored on my counters to see you can see I mean I not have my known decorations here but I only have like what twelve inches probably over here this is full of tea and rice and stuff and over here I have well Emily's blender will be gone in two and a half weeks she can't leave evidence I guess I could maybe put it over there for those who you don't know she's headed off to college Emily's leaving for college so Jane the high school and Dave's going to high school so big kids Denise says love my airfryer still experimenting with it going to use it tonight Sarah I love still pad for peanut brittle and such and Jan says I use parchment paper does the Silpat work better than parchment paper it just works differently so parchment paper works really good if you're only making things like cookies so like mom only makes things like these but I do other things like toffee and hard candies like hard Christmas candies and stuff like that and it works a lot better for those no sorry there were some others there so Ludmila says you should do a chocolate version of the cookies Kenny said I should have said my grandson's nine today yes lynn was wondering does baking soda what about baking soda and fibro it helps my farm yeah it's a fiber where's the CFS um it helps so if you get that sick flu feeling with your friends or myalgia that's what it helps with so I get a sick kind of fluish feeling with my CFS and fibromyalgia to where I just feel like I'm gonna throw up and everything's hurting and so it helps with that and Sarah is asking for the green chili recipe so I'll have to go find that here in a second show us how to make fudge so Stephanie yes I have an instant pot and use it a lot but it's not a must-have cooking here I just the screen cooking I hope how to bake potatoes in a total of 25 to 30 minutes is nice the only thing about the insta pot is I feel like I would need like five of them to do Tom you know what I mean yeah Jennifer says insta pot is awesome frozen ground beef cooked quickly I threw in a complete frozen meal last night it was ready in 20-30 minutes Wow throw in like frozen meatballs and then they would be done yeah and your mom was saying she doesn't like the Silpat because she doesn't like having to wash it and dry it and everything but Sara says I just swish soapy water on it and rub it with my hand and then lay it on the dish drainer to dry that's exactly what we do so so easy yeah Brenda says

see a bunch of stuff Brenda is wondering with baking soda and water for fiber and CFS how much to start I said a half a cup of water and a half a teaspoon of baking soda 1/2 okay yes the quarter it

her dog contracted heartworms from the seed oh so I planted mosquito plants around all the doors in the house did it work Kathy yes we were we're try we've planted things to keep bugs away before and it hasn't worked that great so mosquito plants are the citronella plant but it's a little iffy if it actually works or not Rebecca says thank you for all your frugal tips and tricks I just moved in furnished my whole living room for $38 we're worth something so Mike and I were talking about this the other day if we actually died would it affect anyone's life we think it would affect more people online than in real life I can only think of like a handful of people it would actually affect in real life well we're like mmm although what about the viewers who know us in real life Louise wants to know how's the dog doing after the lump is removed yeah yeah totally back to normal yep there he is walking around now he's he's doing much better he escaped we keep on serving Trevor's his nails he was abused before we got him and his nails were allowed to grow way too long and can't ever get him trimmed back enough so they aren't clanking all over and Sharon says what would we do on Monday Wednesday and Friday and Patricia says it would affect many people it would affect a lot of people online though we were wondering if it would even affect anybody in person I mean we know all these people that would probably come to the funeral they would be sad and then they would go to would anybody in real life I can think of a few people in real life where it would actually affect their lives watching it is one of them just in case you're wondering Jamie yeah but man and Jamie and maybe my brother and sister-in-law so there's four aside from our kids don't count our kids we know our kids I can think of maybe 10 people that if we actually died it would truly affect their life really Ramona says I sprayed mint Listerine an off-brand around the yard and mosquito stay away oh did not

mil baked keto peanut butter cookies on the channel these cookies are out of control delicious from start to finish they take less than 5 minutes to make because there's no baking time and you only need four ingredients to make these but what I also love about this recipe is that portion control is built right into the recipe I'm only gonna show you how to make two no-bake keto peanut butter cookies now of course you can always scale this recipe up and make 10 15 20 cookies if you want to just for me if I make like 10 cookies I want to eat 10 cookies and calories matter even if you're doing keto calories matter if you're if you're doing keto for weight loss anyways that being said let's get right into it and I will show you how to make it be best easy no-bake keto peanut butter cookies in the world first let's talk about the ingredients you'll need for these cookies obviously the first ingredient is peanut butter but you'll want to make sure that you use a peanut butter like this and one that has no sugar added to it and just so you know other nut butters can be used as well next you'll need some unsweetened vanilla almond milk and you'll also need some of this stuff some confectioner swerve because this is how we're gonna sweeten up our no-bake keto cookies without adding any calories or any net carbs and then the last thing you'll need is almond flour which by the way walnut flour or sunflower seed flour can be substituted for this anyways now that you know what you're working with let's get out our food scale just so that we can be as accurate as possible and add a small bowl to it so we're gonna kick this no-bake cookie party off by adding the creamy peanut butter and most importantly use some fresh runny peanut butter don't go using the peanut butter that's been sitting in your cupboard since 1999 and it's as hard as a board and it's stiff and it's clumpy don't use that peanut butter if you do you're gonna have 30 years of bad luck [Music] or you're just not gonna have any no bake cookies because the recipes just not gonna work right if you use that old clumpy peanut butter that said we're gonna add just less than two tablespoons or 24 grams of runny peanut butter to our bowl then we're gonna start adding the almond flour and this isn't an exact science because every peanut butter is a different consistency but around a quarter cup or 28 grams of it is what you want to start with and then of course you can always add a little more if you need it later on the next thing we're going to do is sweeten up our no-bake keto peanut butter cookies and we're going to use just about a tablespoon or 10 grams of the confectioner swerve to do it now at this point we're also going to add just less than a tablespoon or ten grams of the almond milk and then lastly just a pinch of salt to really amplify the flavor of our low-carb cookies so now as you're seeing here you'll want to get out your handy dandy mini spatula and mix everything together until a ball of peanut butter cookie dough forms when it does just kind of work the dough with your hands a little bit and then separate it into two smaller balls of dough because like I said earlier we're going to make two cookies out of this recipe so to do that just kind of shape the dough into cookie form with your hands a little bit and then you can add it to a plate to help continue shaping it and then when it's looking a-ok you can get a fork out and give your no bake peanut butter cookie it's classic cross-hatched pattern then this is kind of a bonus step I like to do normally I'm doing this just for the gram and that is to tighten up the cookie a little bit and make it insta pretty anyways you should end up with some no-bake peanut butter cookie deliciousness like this of course don't forget to make another cookie out of the dough that's still sitting in the bowl over there but that said I'm pretty sure you guys know what to do to make that cookie what I will say though is that there's more info about today's no-bake peanut butter cookies in the video description below so check down there for more info and is I hope you guys enjoy these cookies", "lXL4Pvn5jBI": "[Music] hi everyone welcome to Rock and Robin cooks today's recipe I'm making some flourless peanut butter cookies now being flourless that means this is gluten-free as long as you check all your ingredients and we're gonna be adding some peanuts extra peanuts for a nice crunch nice for the texture and some milk chocolate chips this recipe is super easy and quick to put together and to make and I tell you I think you're gonna love it so I'm rockin Robin and I'm gonna show you how to do it right after this for a recipe guys I'm preheating my oven to 375 degrees now I'm gonna go over the ingredients with you as I put them into my mixing bowl because it's just this is so quick and easy we don't need to do it separately and draw this out so first off we have our peanut butter now I'm using a natural peanut butter I read the labels on my ingredients and you know this just has peanuts Organic peanuts and salt next we'll go with some coconut sugar which I purchased at Trader Joe's and we'll add some brown sugar to that and then we'll add an egg a little bit of vanilla extract and a touch of salt now we'll just mix this all up with our hand mixer until it's really nicely combined [Music] so the mixture is pretty crumbly at this point and that's okay we're gonna use our hands make sure they're clean and we're gonna form little balls but first we're going to add our peanuts and the chocolate chips and you can add as much of that as you like and now I've got myself a little scoop and we're gonna scoop these onto our tray if you want to get the written recipe for this all you do is look below the video in the description area click where it says show more scroll down and you'll find the written recipe now I have a nice baking sheet here with some Silpat on it so that it'll keep our cookies from sticking and I have a scoop here that I'm gonna use and we're gonna scoop these onto our cooking sheet so we'll just take a little scoop of our dough make sure you get some peanuts and chips in there and just make yourself a nice little ball and squeeze it together and then we'll place it right here on our Silpat then I'll continue making little balls [Music] all right now that we have our tray filled we're gonna press these down with a fork so the tines leave their little mark and they look just like regular peanut butter cookies right [Music] now these are gonna go into the oven somewhere between you know 10 and 12 minutes I took the cookies out of the oven after about 11 minutes of baking let them sit in the baking sheet for a good 5 minutes before you take them out and place them on a cooling rack and that's what I did here so they're still warm but I'm gonna go ahead and take a taste those have a nice peanut buttery flavor comes through very well remember there's no flour so it really comes through nice you get a nice crunch from the added peanuts and of course you've got that nice chocolatey milk chocolate flavor from the chips now if you need a recommendation for chocolate chips my recommendation is Guittard I love those chips they are the best thanks so much for watching everybody we'll see you next time in the next video [Music] you", "FSaDasjVVv4": "[Music] hello hello Sharon be makin stuff is back with another video for you guys and today we are going to be making soft and chewy peanut butter cookies so before we get started we gotta get our ingredients so what we will be needing are 1 and 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda 1/4 teaspoon of salt 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter 1/2 a cup of white sugar half a cup of brown sugar 3/4 cups of peanut butter 1 egg and last but not least half a teaspoon of vanilla extract so once you got all your ingredients together let's go ahead and get started in a large medium bowl you did I just say large medium in a medium-sized bowl you are going to place all your dry ingredients in there so this would include your flour your salt baking soda and baking powder I grew up my whole life saying flour instead of flour so if that ever slips out please don't make fun of me so after you got everything together you're just going to mix it all together until it's all well combined and just look at that flour spilling out everywhere come on Sharon get it together so once you're done that set that aside and then in another medium mixing bowl you're going to place your butter in there and then gradually add your white sugar and then gradually I'd never mind just dump that in there and then you're gonna add your peanut butter I like the chunk can you guys can leave a comment below telling me what your favorite kind of peanut butter is is that like - no yeah and if you're allergic to peanut butter you can tell me that - well that's unfortunate so the next step is to cream together your butters and sugars using an electric mixer for about 10 to 15 seconds and don't forget to occasionally scrape the sides of your bowl with a rubber spatula now we are going to throw in the sorry crack in your egg we don't want any shells in there crack in that egg and now we add the vanilla extract so once you got both those ingredients in there you're gonna blend it for another 10 to 15 seconds and once again escaping the sides of your poll and now it is time to combine both your dry ingredients with your wet ingredients so you're going to dump in your flour mixture into your butter sugar mixture and blend it for about 15 seconds until you see no more flour in it until all the white is gone and once again scrape the sides of your bowl so once you've done that you are finished with your cookie dough and I know it smells really good but don't eat it just yet so that's how your dough should look like you're going to prepare two baking sheets or cookie sheets line them with either parchment or wax paper and once that is done you can start rolling your dough into little one to one and a half inch balls you don't actually have to do this part but I just like my cookies nice and even and round so that's why I do this it just looks nicer when it comes out of the oven so you're just gonna roll them out put them on the baking sheet about one inch apart and then after you're done that you can flatten them out with the prongs of a fork you're doing like a crisscross pattern like you see here unfortunately the lines did not show up after I baked the cookies but that's totally fine because they still taste it my edit delicious so that's how my cookies ended up looking like before I put them in the oven and once you got them all flattened out stick them in the oven baking for about 350 degrees Fahrenheit for eight to 10 minutes or until the edges start to turn golden brown so once you your cookies out of the oven they should look something like this and let me tell you guys these peanut butter cookies are so soft and so chewy they are delish if you

video I also do them in English and Spanish so for today's recipe we're going to do some oatmeal cookies they are very easy to prepare and it only takes 15 minutes to bake so let's get started with this recipe for 10 delicious cookies you will need 1 and 1/4 cups of oats 1/2 a cup of sugar half a cup of peanut butter one egg and half a teaspoon of baking powder okay so the first thing that we're going to do is in a bowl we're going to put the peanut butter and the sugar and we're going to mix everything very well I'm using this kind of whisk and it was a little bit of hard just because the peanut butter went inside of it but after a couple minutes I got the hang of it but I think it would be a lot a lot of easier with a fork or with something else maybe with a spatula and once everything is mixed together we're going to add the egg and the half a teaspoon of the baking powder and then we're going to do the same thing it makes everything together and after that's done we're going to add the oats and I try to mix everything with the spatula but it didn't work so I got dirty and I got it my hands in the mix and I mix everything very very well it feels a little bit weird just because the peanut butter is very very sticky but it worked out I'm plus to make the cookie sweet we're actually are going to need our hand so I just well do it before Hey okay and once everything is done we're going to get a little ball like this and we're going to play with it just kidding so we're going to make a little ball and then what we're trying to do is make form like a little cookie and what I did is just flat the ball that I did before make a really really fly and then it's hard to explain but you can see on the video what I'm doing so just do that it's very very easy and then I did that to my whole mix you should get about ten to nine cookies depending on the size that you did them once we're done we're just going to put them in the baking sheet and we're going to pop in them in the oven for 40 minutes to 350 degrees and you should notice that they're done once they're a little bit of brown and then we're just going to enjoy them they are very delicious they are very soft um the taste of the peanut butter and the oatmeal it's super delicious I promise if you bake these cookies you want they are very delicious and that's it for today's video

i think i woke up on the wrong side of the bed well i actually did wake up in a really weird way um i don't know if this ever happened to you but i keep getting these like cramps in the back of my calves and what did you call them babe charlie horse i shoot out of bed i'm like ow oh my god and i have to stand on the balls of my feet to get this to stop so that's how i woke up this morning and it sent me into a bit of a funny spin and poor cody he's jumping out of the bed going oh my god what's wrong i'm like it's fine don't worry i just have to snap it out and i stamped it out and now i'm fine but i think i'm a bit delirious you know anyway how you're doing good um so you're gonna need for this um cookie hot [ __ ] pancake an egg um peanut butter which i just opened and it smells amazing i like peanut butter peanut butter extra crunchy i like crunchy you don't have to use crunchy there is no flour in this sugar i don't actually know any of the measurements but as we go i think we should figure out the measurements just because it's comforting to know how much you're putting in isn't it but i just do it by um by texture um i would suggest you use baking paper um i don't have baking paper because we accidentally purchased wax paper i have no idea if that's gonna burn in the oven so this could be one of those mad cooking with just moments where we burn down the kitchen but i'm gonna try it it's wax paper it does say you can put it in the oven they don't take very long they take like 12 minutes right okay that doesn't fit i do love them anyway how's everyone doing you're right joss are you ticklish yes yes i am i'm very ticklish and it really is annoying i hate it when you do tickle me i hate it no tickles horrible honestly i think it's a form of abuse tickling oh even talking about it makes me feel stressed out i don't like it i don't want any part in it no tickling in fact i had a conversation with cody about the baby i said when the baby comes please if they don't like mean tickle please don't tickle them because i remember being tickled as a child by my dad and um obviously when you're being tickled you're laughing because something happens to your body that makes you laugh but that laughter confuses the tickler into thinking that you're having a nice time well you're not no no no i thought you were coming i put it on 400. it says oh well done no but this recipe is it the recipe i don't know where i got this from i got the one that says does that one have flour in it though no is it just peanut butter egg and sugar yes oh well our oven's a bit hot now he's turned it down and be fine saving the day yet again anyway so yes it i thought he was coming to take away see the fear i've been scarred that as an example of being scarred right so anyway right let's get these cuts out so your background is going to be one cup peanut butter one cup like sugar and one egg yeah that's it it's so simple there you go one one one thank you babe i love it it's so good okay so um in the past i have just made this without measuring it so if you get the measurements wrong it doesn't matter you're looking for a consistency but now we've googled it we know it's one cup peanut butter one cup sugar and one egg so this is like a cup so if you're in england you don't have a cup um there is a specific measurement do not do what i did at the beginning of my time and get a mug and think that's a cup because i ain't there's not cut that is something you drink tea out of it is a cup but it's not a measuring cup which is this look at that so different so different so if you just have a mug just fill it halfway or fill it the four way and put two eggs in doesn't matter anyway okay so i'll tell you a story story time you guys all right george from brazil hello gorgeous you you're right how's life hi maria you have a bump i do have a bump look i got massive i know i'm eating too much i have to this is what cooking with joss is doing to me it's turning me into a little i don't know roly-poly oh i just eat so much now i know i know it's baby but there's only a little bit of baby in there i think it's mostly just me not weird well depends how weird you think it is but um i love oranges i just had an orange actually just before we were talking and i don't mean oranges i mean like uh clementine satsumas something that's easy to open because when i'm one-on-one on orange i've got an orange i don't want to sit there for ages trying to peel it um the other day we were in what was that shop when i got all flustered no remember when we were in rhode island and i ate seven oranges on the way home it was like walmart or something yeah yeah i got so hot yeah and i just literally burst into tears i went we were walking along and cody said you're right love and i went ah yeah i'm fine i wasn't fine i just needed oranges and we got in the car and i had seven oranges and i felt great see i'm easily pleased okay so we're doing the measurements that's a good old spoon or the peanut butter's good [Music] i like peanut butter that gives you energy too it's bloody good isn't it warren says no wax paper in the oven really yeah i think we're going to burn down the place if we put the wax paper in the oven but google says different i like more and better than google you do yeah yeah okay let's not do it oh okay we won't put the wax paper in the oven thank you is it warren yeah thank you warren save the day um one cup um so i guess we're just gonna butter the pan i don't suggest doing that i suggest going to get um baking paper baking paper is just so much easier it really is it's so so so much easier but don't worry about it we're just gonna roll with the punches and make this happen it's all gonna be good one cup of crunchy peanut butter now sugar now the story about these do you remember the cookies that i sent you home yeah yeah so the story about these and peanut butter cookies is i was flirting with cody right so we weren't oh my god break my bloody now we won um together as such we were just talking a lot and it was like face timing and you know writing letters stuff like that and i went to the nail salon down the road where i was living in brooklyn and um the i was telling the lady about it she was so sweet oh she was so sweet ah her name was vivi and anhui she had two names but anyway um she said oh my gosh he sounds like the perfect man because cody was always doing really romantic things for me whilst he was in um iraq but he still managed to do it so if i kind of would go out in new york with my friends and get bit pissed um which didn't happen often but it didn't happen um he would send me breakfast this is a good tip by the way guys and girls if you want to woo someone and you're far away or even if even if you're not far away let's say you're just dating um and you still live in separate abodes if you really like somebody and you know they've had like fun night and maybe a bit hungover or whatever just call overeat and order them breakfast cody did that for me it was so sweet and you would never tell me i would get a um a knock on the door i think who's that i didn't invite anyone around so i go to the door and there's this chat there and he goes um hands me a bag of whatever the treats were could have been you know some chocolate croissant or some scrambled eggs or something and here we go oh this is from cody you know how the [ __ ] do you mean it's from cody it's in baghdad it can't be from cody but it was anyway so sweet so i would tell and we about these things i would go and get my nails done and we'd have little girly chats and i'd be like oh he did this thing for me oh so sweet she was like you need to send him some things like i don't know how to do that um you know that i can send like letters and stuff i don't know if i can send stuff anyway um it turned out that i could send stuff to him and he gave me this special address hang on i'm putting in i'm putting in one cup of sugar now and just mixing it up so yeah so i could send him stuff to this i don't know special kind of what is the type of address babe it's like a military address isn't it so it's still going to america it's just uh apo dpo apo dupio lots of numbers in it anyway i didn't know that i could send food so i made him these cookies they're really easy to make and they kept okay didn't they they were okay when you had them when you had them i mean it must have been weeks later there's a lot of sugar in it so it's not gonna go off um were they crunchy or soft however he was still soft well anyway he liked it i think i got those around the time we were being attacked it was cool i'm really glad that you got them and it was nice to be able to do that for him because he was always doing things like that for me so let's see see how it looks check this out there you go oh it smells good already right anyway i'm jibbering on too much here we are says hello stranger who remember me from canada i do remember neil bolt why do i call her a neil bolt from the cadet yeah so funny hi neil how's it going are you who's making these cookies with me anybody is anyone making them oh leticia that's a cool name that was sweet of cody may i ask how you two met well are you ready okay so we met in an airport but i was not in a position to be flirting with cody when we met so i basically avoided him that's a long story short but i saw him in the airport and i was like oh my god he's bloody lovely in me so i um i avoided him because i was not free and i was in a bit of a relationship with a guy that was like sweet but you know we weren't really vibing anyway and um he he was traveling to belize and i was um i was traveling from antarctica to police to do a gig and he was just a total gentleman and he was the only other guy on the plane so of course we're all talking to him i'm talking about we're all i mean me and my crew which is harry and leon um they were chatting away to him and i was just kind of being polite but i don't know if i was doing too much chatting because i was a little bit like he's a bit handsome bit too handsome to be talking to when you're in a relationship anyway then we kind of went through immigration and said goodbye and i was like oh yeah nice to meet you mate have a nice holiday you know and then he turned up at the um the same hotel with us i was like oh [ __ ] we were downstairs having a beer and there he bloody is i was like oh god there's that handsome guy from the bloody airport so i decided i cannot sit here and chat to a handsome man so what i'm gonna do i'm gonna come up with an excuse to leave so i stood up i hadn't even finished my dinner i was like i'm going to go and buy some shampoo say shampoo is actually conditioner for whatever so i said i'm going to go and buy some shampoo i must be off and harry looked at me like okay i mean we've just arrived here from we we have just been on five planes and um i didn't really need any shampoo it was the last game it was it was kind of a stupid thing but i just needed to get out of there so then of course i had to make that true because i don't lie i do it not doing it so i was like right okay bye so i split harry looked at me like something's weird cody was like okay whatever she can buy shampoo so then i walked outside i found a cab and i said um i need to go and buy some shampoo and chatted to the guy i remember talking to the guy about his mum anyway that's another story anyway so he took me to the supermarket and he waited for me which is good because i don't know if it was completely the safest place to be wandering around so he sat outside and waited for me i bought my shampoo and then i um got back in the cab and drive back and i thought oh we're gone now he'll be gone he won't go he was in the elevator when i got into the elevator and i was like ah and you know when you fancy someone it's really awkward so we were stood like there like okay i pressed my um number he presses i was like okay okay and then he got out the lift and i was like my god he's gone it's much too handsome and um then i felt this really honestly i [ __ ] you not this is the truth i felt like worried i felt like what if that was him what if and then i just reasoned with myself i mean and when i say that was him i mean like that was the one right apparently i was right but anyway um and then i reasoned with myself no no no it's just because i'm having a bad relationship or i'm having an argument currently with with chappie and anyway it's very interesting the story does go on because then he was gone then wasn't he the next day a chap called rudy rudy are you on here sometimes we see rudy on here do we see rudy maybe not sometimes he comes on have a look out for him babe because cody got chatting to rudy who is a fan of my music who flew to belize to see the gig they somehow crossed paths after we'd met and started talking cody didn't know my stage name you know as a singer you know as english but he didn't know i had to find me really told him how to find me and then he found me and then i had to ignore him for another four months kind of yeah i was polite and nice he messaged me oh hi how you doing i can't remember what you said and i was like oh thanks oh that was another thing you did he paid for all of our drinks and that night at the bar take notes guys take notes because if you want to be remembered there's little things that you can do even if that the timing isn't right because the timing was not right i was like nope not gonna entertain this but he's stuck in my mind anyway now here we are this this and this and cookies so it worked all of my mates say including my dad now cody needs to write a book he needs to write a book on how to be smooth oh it was our anniversary yesterday oh he put petals everywhere and candles everywhere anyway i could talk about this all day long i don't know if you're getting bored about this now but i just love him and i could talk about how amazing he is all day right so so far we haven't been very productive all we've done is chat about love and and as far as the cooking with just bit goes we basically have put peanut butter with sugar it's not productive guys okay egg we're getting rid of that cause that's gonna burn do not put that in the oven one egg [Music] i've cracked my nail again so i need to get some nail glue i've i've just put the egg in can you see you can't see egg it's in there i'm just gonna smush it together okay and that's it smushing how's everyone doing you're right oh dear so then anyway so then he said oh on these messages right that there were very few but he said i'm going to be in europe this is very common when you're a musician and you travel around the world um people that you meet on your travels often message you saying hey i'm going to be in europe and are you guys playing any festivals so he messaged and said i'm going to be in europe on one of my months off um i just wondered whether you guys are gonna be there he didn't say whether you guys are gonna be there i think i think he said whether you're gonna be there no i'm telling it vaguely aren't i anyway i just said harry might not be there no no he's coming into correct completely wrong sorry sorry it's a bit vague so what i said i said hi are you gonna be in europe i'd love to take you to dinner and have a nice time right and that's what i said and she said oh i'll be there but i don't think harry will be there i literally and i looked at my phone and i was like what hey why is she talking about i didn't think you meant me me me i think i thought you meant you i don't know guys i said you let's see are you guys i said are you going to be in europe and are you available for dinner because i'd love to he might have said you and i might have ignored the you because i wasn't ready sorry just wasn't ready and anyway so i just said yeah harry and leon might not be there because it might be um not a total world tour gig where harry always comes for those and leon might it might be steve playing and said leon anyway i'm sorry baby it worked out it didn't deter you at all no he's very like pretty focused in there most people be like oh she's annoying she doesn't she's not giving me an inch hi i love you right so that's it we've put the egg in we've smushed it all together now we need to do is make small balls and pop it in the oven we'll try one maybe let's try two and see how many minutes it takes it might take 10 minutes but we'll have a chat um oh oil thank you yeah i put a bit of butter on i don't know normally i just put it straight if you have baking paper just put it straight on the baking paper okay but we're not we haven't got baby paper so we're going to do butter don't forget what don't forget that's another story about me and cody my friends made him a song oh god i don't know if we can ever post that video but i hope one day we do that it is the [ __ ] funniest thing yeah okay right we've got butter now how big do you want your pancakes pancakes why do i keep saying pancakes stuck in my mind i think i'm hungry you need enough orange hurry up i can't get myself up why am i cranking myself up so much right okay okay i suggest i suggest how big get a little bit of the goo put it in your hands and then roll it like so eagles trying to get up on the server you know what it may be like this this is now a peanut butter ball okay pop it on it's gonna be fine oh renee said but in the end you had dinner together months later yes yes we did it was actually not where was it in spain should i tell that story that's a sweet story it's a sad story and a sweet story i don't know if you guys remember but remember when i was deported from iran that day that was a sad day for me because i wanted to play there and and it was kind of the last well it was the last gig on the total world tour that had taken me six years to do and um i feel like it's the only country that has been has been left out of that which is basically not the point of the tour the point of the tour the only really important point of that tour was to not leave anywhere else or anyone else or any group or nation or you know to not just go to some places that pay you you know you have to just treat everyone the same anyway i tried and they deported me because i am a woman and i am a singer and that's something that's not really allowed over there so i was gutted and at this time cody and i were talking um and so i got i got deported that the next place they sent us was where was it so when you when you get deported from somewhere they put you on the next plane out and the next plane out was actually the next morning and it was going to dubai and my next show was in barcelona and cody was on his holiday and his his job would be three months on the job one month off so in that one month off instead of going home he would go traveling and that's the time that he said oh i'm um i'm going to be in europe are you doing gigs there which we were he was in italy with his friend um he was going to go to the vatican weren't you and um had all these plans so sorry anyway so i texted him i was so upset about iran and you know i don't know if you've heard me talk about um uh silver linings before or anything but i've i mentioned this a lot i say if if something [ __ ] in your life happens and you don't see a silver lining to it um make one make a silver lining look at all of your options and make a silver lining like when uh those people tried to kill me i decided right i'm going to make a silver lining i'm going to get puppies and um say that they are very protective and actually igor is on the top three most protective dogs in the world apparently but anyway i made a silver lining out of that so that this this was that so i said to cody i'm being deported i'm gonna be in barcelona i said will you be my silver lining and he from that cancelled all of his plans and um got on a train i think and headed to barcelona and booked a ticket well not a train but i went to the airport went to the airport and and he was there and we were really nervous because we hadn't dated and it was all just like okay hi and it was the best the next day we had a picnic fell in love oh this is a nice cooking with justin they're talking about love do we talk about love every time i think we probably do i'm putting two on you can put loads more on but you're gonna see how they spread they're gonna spread a lot right so fork you need this because you're gonna smush okay right dip this i've just shoved it in the mixture dip this in the sugar dipped squish dip squish see that squishing squishing technical terms squishing i just hope it doesn't stick oh peanuts then put some actual peanuts on top oh they're salted doesn't matter it'll still be delicious salted fine uh we don't want like four you can't get four ones i'm just gonna give it a little yep yep they're good there's it i mean you if you put loads on because it's going to spread so much it's going to look like you put none on so don't worry about it pop these on there and then you will have a nice lovely thing like this sugar hang on oops little shove that i'm just gonna shove it i won't chop it i'll just do full ones yeah let's just do a crazy yeah pop that in there shove that in there get a little squish sugar sugar okay it's gonna be good delicious okay we're gonna put it in the oven i reckon it'll take 12 minutes oh there's already a pan in there get out the way pan okay do not put it on the top right time me not me time the cookies um like 12 minutes wash your hands get rid of any viruses i know i didn't wash it for long enough but whatever right so uh that's it and then we just have a cup of tea i really feel like i need a cup of tea now i said to cody the other day i can't drink tea you know pg tips in that i can't drink it anymore only only for now i hope to god that um when baby comes out i hope i can have a cup of tea again but i can't something about it not a normal cup you know when i say normal cup i mean black tea either pg or yorkshire or tetley's or berries i can't have any of those something about it just doesn't work um but come on i'm into i'm into chamomile so i said to him i said tim i really love that honey vanilla come on and the next day they come to heaven here is one he's got all these teas this is only some of it i think he um maybe click the wrong button but okay if you ask you get so i put the kettle on anyway it's very very sweet very very sweet in me ah dear is everyone good you're right eric you're right it's fan hi angie oh live from afgham how's everyone enough come doing don't forget about it one more cool i don't know what that means oh well just remind me when 10 minutes is up oh thank you for the stars the stars are going to go to the kids in armenia that are um that are needing instruments and fun you know they're having a bit of [ __ ] time as it were so this time that's what it is that's what we're collecting our stars for so thank you so much thank you thank you oh and flower oh she's over there sleeping should i get flower do you want to see flower she is so cute i love her okay isn't she sweet look at her little face you're right mate you're a bit sleepy i know i woke her up she was like i don't want to get up so this is flower we're fostering her whilst we're here in nashville making a record um she's very she's a very little beagle see she's so sweet um she's looking for a home what's the name of the adoption place sosbeagles.org she's just the sweetest thing in the world and you can get in touch with us if you want to adopt her um she's just looking for love yeah anyone in tennessee area or if they want to drive they could be further out couldn't they oh she's so sweet she's just very like soft in her way but then when food comes around she gets crazy she's so excited about food which makes her very very easy to train are you working on it i am yeah but it's good because you can reward her with food i remember with missy my rottweiler was she was actually really hard to train because she didn't care about food she she kind of wanted cuddles but um but really food wasn't really her thing so um made it more difficult i love this dog she's so sweet but yeah so she's learnt sit come and uh off so she jumps up a little bit gets excited and now she's good and out i feel like she's learnt out now as well from the kitchen you know because that's when food's around she's just like crazy um and she she gets it she stays behind that line so it's good just pop her back so she can have a little sleep no no no you can't have the other two but yeah it's good they're getting along well at first she was a bit scared of the other dogs but she seems good now i don't know if maggie likes her i think she's warming up to her but you know how some dogs will show they don't like another dog by like biting them maggie doesn't do that she's just ignoring you know i wonder if it's because of the attention you know anyway oh oh thank you i need this tea i do i need it like i need a hmm it's good i should tell you about this i mean i don't know should i tell them oh should i give it a secret no about yesterday celestial seasonings honey vanilla chamomile [Music] it's good i know it's going to make me sleepy though isn't it i don't care delicious oh look we were just talking about missy and this is my missy it's big of a cracked screen because i travel with it but i take this with me everywhere this is a picture of my missy i love her yeah it's hard it's hard having dogs my dad said well it's lovely having dogs it's hard having dogs when they go um my dad said to me joss just remember that if you invest in a dog you are investing in heartache because they will die before you that's nice and bright and breezy isn't it but um it's kind of true and you have to prepare yourself for that it's really upsetting when they go but you have to you have to kind of really enjoy the good times because they give you so much obviously you give them everything that you can love and play and compassion and food and um hopefully health but oh look she's coming around to have a little sniff now but yeah i just wish they would live for 100 years and they don't it's annoying chrissy said they have good peach tea what here you ate a pumpkin yes i don't know i'm a bit concerned how big am i actually gonna get i'm six months i've got three more months i'm gonna be huge it's gonna be like i don't know it's a funny thing because when i first started to when the tummy first started to move out it felt like there was a baby in there kind of trying to get out like this way it was like you know and then my tummy felt like um it was falling off of me a little bit you know like the weight is in the front and i'm not used to that it's been mad it's been a journey i think it's fantastic though it's really brilliant but odd i'll take flower she is a cutie leticia you should get in contact with us if you're really serious about that i mean she's the sweetest yeah i know i think the adoption people they do their thing i mean they go and they check out your house and your life and you know it's like anything if you're adopting a baby even that would happen um and then then you have a friend for life it's amazing it is amazing to be able to do that it's different when you buy a dog you know you go to the dog breeder you give them some money and then you come home with a dog there's less care in it but when you're adopting it matters because it matters um what your home is like what your life is like what your personality is like um because often times these dogs have been abused we don't know what happened to flower but she's definitely a little bit a little bit timid at first now she's not at all and on the first day she was like the other two dogs freaked her out you know so there are things to consider so if you do want to please please get in contact with us um joe um we'll post the link we've we've set up an email address for it um and also we'll play we'll post a link to the adoption um site as well and um i'd love that we're leaving here on the 17th so i would love it if we could find her a home before we leave i wish i could take her with us but we can't um so yeah lucy dusty's not not with us anymore i'm sorry lucy nope she lived to 15. it's very sad i miss dusty right cookies oh it's looking good people i just love how simple this recipe is look at that those are nice now i like them crunchy i would cook them a little bit more should i do them a bit more yeah perfect cookie right good so easy so easy i bet you could do it with cashew nut um butter as well i don't know i haven't tried it yeah i miss my dusty ah i adopted my dog and her name is just because of you angela that's so nice thank you that's really sweet [Music] ah i'm reading thank you very much that's very sweet thank you oh thank you sophia thank you lucy that's really sweet hannah sennett hi love flower looks adorable i'm sure someone will be able to give her a lovely home yes i hope so that would be good she's such a sweet girl and um in the last few days she has started making the beagle howl like when the other dogs barking because she was really silent at first which is great but also not because you want them to express themselves um and she had i think another dog outside and she went oh [Music] it was very cute very very cute so i popped it back in this is when i normally make um the mistake of leaving it in too long so pop it back in for like one more minute and then um you take off the baking paper which i hope that you have and then leave it on the side to cool and then it will be like good if you have it before it's cold it's just going to be squashy and i don't know i think some people like that but i don't like that it's been a minute oh yeah one more minute the right one is um looking pretty good um now if we bought this string i asked cody get some ribbon so we could tie the cookies together but um he came up with a man version which i do still think could be cool we could make it rustic you know string it's just as good brown paper package is tied up with string these are a few of my favorite things that's what string reminds me of every time anyway um so if you were going to make like five or six or eight of them are whatever depending on how big your cookie is you can tie them up with a piece of ribbon or string or you know there's lots of little packaging ideas that you can do with cookies so yeah but we've only made two and they're gonna take a little bit of a while to call so it's just an idea there's loads of ideas on pinterest actually you can go on and and i think this is also nice for um like christmas gifts i like to make christmas gifts i think that's kind of part of christmas really for me is to make something for people um one year i did like a little tiny pot of jam it was like really small it was really cute and um and then like there was another tiny little jug i got it from like buy and save there was these little cute jars and they weren't massive um so there was like some jam i think i put a candle in there or something and uh some dressing i should teach you guys how to make the dressing i love this dressing it makes you want to eat bowls and bowls and bowls of salad we'll do that next um so yeah it's a nice thing to chuck some cookies in there and get like a little basket we'll talk about this when christmas comes anyway right guys cookies are perfect now oh yeah that's better i like that okay can i show you yeah okay can you see that yeah oh yeah i'll make more and post a nice picture um but it's um they need to call a little bit so otherwise they'll be weird see how they're little yeah no it's okay they're not bad no no it's good i know the butter oh my god okay oh you're so sweet thank you okay whoops oh yeah they come off really easy [Music] oh no oh [ __ ] see that one started falling apart that's fine it would do i should have left it flat but it's good [ __ ] that one do i have to wait no i don't want to wait they're bloody hot have a bit anyway just pull off a bit of that one yeah um happy autumn happy halloween happy peanut butter cookie day um i hope you make loads if you do post a little picture so i can see just kind of make sure you eat as many of them as possible all right take care lovelies i've had a lovely time chatting to you all so nice to see you all oh rachel said i think she's gonna have a little girl that's what i said he reckons it's a girl too we'll find out i don't know i don't know bye", "S6R_PBd3scI": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to melissa's kitchen table today we're going to be making um double peanut butter cookies and um i will leave the list of ingredients down below so let's get started so in this bowl i have well first my oven's preheating to 350 degrees so in this bowl i have two and a half cups of all-purpose flour [Music] to that i gotta get my half cup half i'm going to use a half teaspoon measuring so i only have to clean one of them but the baking soda is a half teaspoon the baking powder is a full teaspoon so that's a half one full teaspoon so we live in connecticut and we just had a really big huge snowstorm so my dog is on the back porch playing in all the snow so you might hear him and then we need one teaspoon of salt all right so to that i'm gonna whisk that up really quick so i wanted to do this video the proper way to show you how you're really supposed to be making cookies to be honest i usually don't mix all my dry ingredients but you can do however you want to do it so over here i have two sticks it's supposed to be softened butter um but i had a soft of mine in the microwave and i went a little too long what else is new so you're gonna do your butter we're gonna do one and one half cups of brown sugar one uh half cup of regular sugar and again i'm using a half cup measure so half cup and then now uh the dark or the brown sugar will make your cookies softer usually people like a nice soft peanut butter cookie if for any reason you don't have enough brown sugar you can either make it with your white sugar and molasses or like if i'm short a half a cup i might just substitute a half cup white sugar i don't think it's that big of a deal but that's up to you and i think this is going to be all of my brown sugar and hopefully this is the only christmas cookie i make that needs brown sugar so i think i have like a teaspoon in here honestly i'm just gonna i'll probably save it i'll use that for a recipe all right so i'm gonna put this on my mixer get this mixing together hang on all right so in the meantime while that's mixing i'm going to get my peanut butter and we're going to need a full cup of fat [Applause] okay now i'm using reese's creamy peanut butter but of course you can use your favorite peanut butter you can use chunky you could use smooth whatever you want you could add peanuts to this however you want to do it all right so we're going to cream the peanut butter in with the sugar and butter all right i'm going to let that go for probably a minute minute and a half okay so i'm gonna put it on low to that i'm gonna add two eggs one at a time i do put them in another container just to make sure that the eggs are good [Applause] all right so we'll stop that push the sides down all right keep that going add in the second egg [Applause] and to this we will add some vanilla a teaspoon of vanilla that i don't measure all right so that looks pretty combined again we will scrape down the beater and the sides to this we're now going to add our dry ingredients [Music] that's not easy all right mix it in a little at a time so it doesn't go everywhere i try to stop it where this feeder is out of my way it doesn't always work out for me mix that in let me go get my dog all right and to this i will add the remaining amount of flour okay so i'm gonna let that finish mixing and in the meantime i'm gonna get two cookie sheets lined with parchment paper all right and then i'm going to add the final ingredient which is a cup of peanut butter chips and of course i have been having a very hard time finding the the reese's brand i used to get them all the time at walmart so yeah i've had a really hard time finding them i was able to find these at shop right [Applause] i've also found toll house like peanut butter and chocolate chip you can use those if you'd like you can use chocolate chip you can use none you can use peanuts you can do whatever you want you can add coconut and chocolate chips that would be really good all right so just take this out get it out of the way and then i use a cookie scoop it's a lot easier so the recipe calls for one inch balls and you should get 36 cookies i can't guarantee how many i will get i will try to get them but i just use a cookie scoop like this and place them right down that might be a little bit bigger than an inch i don't know that's what we're using so all right those going now you can flatten these out with the forks and put some sugar on them i have about a tablespoon of brown sugar left so i'm probably going to do that let me do that with these just so you can see what it looks like [Music] you just press down one way and then the other and spread on just a little little bit of sugar i mean nothing crazy just like that you can use regular sugar and then i'm gonna put these in the 350 degree oven and these are going to bake for 10 to 11 minutes until slightly golden brown just along the edges then we'll take them out put them on a wire rack and i'll show you what they look like [Music] you", "kdkjo5LyfPE": "guys it's you know welcome

kitchen yep I am going to pull up the tick tock that I'm going to be following today we're going to be making these like chocolate chip cookies that have been seeing n tick tock they're like not a lot of recipes are made with peanut butter so we're gonna try them do not mind the background because you're going to hear diamond you are because she's I'm in my kitchen and not in my room so we're gonna try this out I saw Casey Holmes do these she's a youtuber she doesn t talk as well I saw her do it if you are new here all my social medias or if you not know who and you haven't noticed all my social medias are linked and in description bar down below follow my Instagram because as you can tell I just posted polls you could also follow me on Twitter and snapchat you go on it so I'll list it down there so without further ado let's get right on into the video so the first thing we're going to do is preheat our oven to 350 yep so what we need is brown sugar peanut butter brown sugar peanut butter so let's go get the brown sugar I'm just gonna carry you guys with me I am getting the brown sugar out of this little tiny thingy I think it's this one bronzer and now we need some peanut butter peanut butter peanut butter peanut butter we need one more day and obviously I washed my hands before I had to rewash them because I touched me what's up we need then need to finish watching this figure what we need and baking soda baking soda do not grab baking powder don't do it and chocolate chips chocolate chips these are semi-sweet what we use okay so now I need to see what measurements like me should have wrote this down so we have oh geez we have a bowl we have our egg brown sugar baking soda chocolate chips and our peanut butter I am going to need a spoon and a butter knife as well all right so the first ingredient we put in I don't know how this is gonna work what cranly's gonna work is the brown shirt need a cup of it now brown sugar you got to pack it in if you don't know this already that's what I'm doing over here so what you do is you put in we're gonna break ours up a little bit brown sugar then it said I hate to just watch this winter and I should've wrote this down one cup peanut butter no got the spoon for we gotta stir it the peanut butter we use is jiff it's natural it's creamy and also this is my dad's I use crunchy years dealing his peanut butter and my dogs heard the peanut butter container she don't believe me ya know your girls can wait I'll let you lick the spoon when I am done all right this is our one cup peanut butter we are going to scoop it in here now is a lot of peanut butter I'm just following the recipe up if you can't tell I am very skeptical at these cookies you think they're basically just gonna be peanut butter cookies I'm trying to get most of it off and put it on here I am gonna be nice I'm gonna let my dogs lick the rest this spoon and then I'm getting rid of this spoon also this peanut butter is safe for them to eat do not come for me in the comments but it's safe for them check everything in love peanut butter so we're done with the peanut butter next thing we're doing is our one egg this is a large egg that is our oven being done all right and now we have our tablespoon of a baking soda but I want double Chek teaspoon dude I have a teaspoon I do have a teaspoon I do not worry this is a baking soda this is why we got the sky we're gonna put it over whatever is left for peanut butter like to do is I like to give it in my thing and that's a bunch of it and then I like to take it and like chop it kind of and then scoop it we got a nice baking soda and that's to help it rise I got baking powder I don't remember we got our half a cup and we're gonna add some chocolate chips we may add a little bit more because like why not make it funny ya know let's make it with chocolate chips these are the Hershey's kitchens ones check the expiration date on these because you have been ever been we got a new bag there's not been open same chocolate chips eyes haven't been open mmm we're gonna do a half the cup diamond honey you can't have these have a cup so this is what our mixture looks like we're gonna take this guy it's a spatula we're gonna stir it I couldn't use the mixer for this that could have worked just kind of break up the chunks of brown sugar I will show you what we're working with this right here is the batter it doesn't look bad I don't know okay these are done so I need a cookie scooper medium-sized cookie scoop and I'm gonna need a baking sheet now my cookie sheet we're gonna scoop them on I'll show you what they look like when they are done being scooped what I do is I fill up the rim and we're gonna do three then two then three this is how I do cookies whether it's this recipe other cookies this is how I do my cookie scooping I'm kind of excited to try these I told my boyfriend he's at work today told him that I was making these and he was a little excited so I was trying a new tick-tock recipes so he votes on all my Instagram polls that I posted for videos and he voted for the tick-tock one he wants these cookies so it looks like I will need another tray so one tray for me just how I like to do my cookies is one two three eight cookies on one tray that's not bad so this makes another eight that's sixteen cookies but we will see miss diamond I'm gonna need you to knock all right so I got two extra on here so that's eight and eight sixteen seventeen eighteen this has made eighteen cookies it says to put them in the oven for eight to ten minutes so I got to move some racks around because I'm able to fit more and I will be right back so this is what they are looking like so we put them in the oven for eight minutes if I put the timer on just where I did we have them in there for eight minutes I will show you what they look like let me put the time or the light on so what they look and like we are gonna see what they look like no we're good yeah in the meantime I'll see you guys when they are done cooking or baking I'm super excited we have two left on here that still need to be cooked but yeah so this is what they are looking like I patted them down a little bit only because they are still like kind of super gooey on the inside and when I do like that though I do also want them to actually be baked on the inside but not too much on the bottom so we're gonna see how they just look or feel when they actually harden in stuff because you can see in this one like right there it's still like super gooey but we have the other batch going in right now for eight minutes and then I will let you guys know what happens if I need to put them in the oven or not this is what they look like they look really good my mom already ate one and she said they were good so I'm about to try half one and let you know what it is like but I cook them personally for 10 minutes and then what I did is I flattened them a little bit after they did so that the rest of the insides would cook because they puff up so much from the baking soda so I'm gonna grab a cookie one that I just touched and we're going to just break it open a little bit this is what it looks like on the inside so we're gonna try it this is over this is way better than in the DI cheap oh really [Music] those are so good I would suggest you try them out I don't know who started this I just know I sawed off from Casey Holmes I'll have it linked in the description bar down below the tic-tock that I watched to get this really easy you literally just need a bowl and a couple cups like measuring cups and that's literally it this was so good I'm actually very shocked I'm actually very excited as well because this probably become a regular recipe that I do just have to double the recipe to make more cookies but other than that it was a success all right guys well as the end of today's video I really hope you guys enjoyed it if you liked seeing me do

anything low-carb diet related if you follow me on social media last week you would have seen that I posted a little sneak peek of some cookies what is better than kicking off the holiday season which is fastly approaching with a good surefire cookie recipe now everybody needs this recipe in their life because not only is it amazing and tastes great but it only has three ingredients and those ingredients are probably something you already have in your fridge and your pantry if you are on a low carb diet already so without further ado I want to show you guys what ingredients you're going to need to make this and then we're gonna get on right into it and make these cookies because I'm starving and I want to snack okay so first you're going to need 1/3 of a cup of your favorite low-carb sweetener you guys know I love trivia that's what I'm using today it took 24 packets of trivia to equal 1/3 of a cup then you're going to need a cup of peanut butter in this case I like to use Skippy peanut butter the natural versions of peanut butter are a little too oily for me I find with this recipe so I like to stick to my favorite like childhood peanut butter which in this case is creamy Skippy peanut butter you're also going to need 1 large egg and the optional ingredient is 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and then also right before you pop these in the oven I'm also going to be using a little bit of my favorite Himalayan sea salt so now that you know the ingredients let's get on into making these babies would you combine everything together the egg the peanut butter the Truvia in the vanilla optional of course just mix everything together and then you'll see that all the ingredients are going to start to get hard to stir and that's you know that's the time when you know that the batter has come together that is exactly what we're looking for it kind of looks like a little tough to stir it's very stiff that is exactly what we want now all we need to do is put this on a cookie sheet which I'll show you how to do in just a minute and bake them and then literally we're ready to eat okay first thing you want to do spray your cookie sheet with some nonstick spray and then using a tablespoon measure you're just going to take a tablespoon of the batter like that put it right in your hand and just roll it into a ball and place it on your cookie sheet so I'm going to make 12 more balls just like this and then I'll show you what to do next [Music] so now we have our 12 cookie balls now what we're gonna do you can always use a fork just like that traditional way but I like to use a potato masher I finally have use for this thing all you want to do is push down and then lift up and then go down to each one and then we're going to do a crosshatch on the other way but this side I want to do mostly to make the impression but also to flatten the cookies down all right so then you just want to go the other way [Music] on top of each one I'm going to take a little grinding of my favorite Himalayan sea salt and I'm just gonna do a tiny grind on each cookie the smallest amount the little bit of salt really brings out the flavor in these cookies ready for that [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] guys these cookies smell amazing like when I tell you that you will not even realize that these are low-carb I'm really not kidding you I wanted to show you look how amazing that crust is like are you even serious they are so good they're definitely gonna be like a more soft cookie not so much chewy but I really think you guys are gonna like these my tastes went really quick come on oh my gosh they're still warm when you let them cool completely to room temperature I mean I should have but I'm impatient and it was hungry these are so melt in your mouth peanut buttery a little bit crunchy on the outside mm-hmm I'm just dropping a piece where did the dogs look at it mm-hmm you have to go and make this today I'll put the link down below to my blog you can go there and get the full recipe do you want to learn how to make it and if you do recreate these let me know in the comments if you like them or not if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and as always please subscribe to my channel where we do all things low-carb here so until then I'm gonna take my cookies put them on a nice platter and I hope you guys have a wonderful wonderful weekend [Music]", "ZPTavHaWto4": "you this recipe for classic peanut butter cookies comes from all recipes number Shirley Sadler another member commented it makes great cookies first in a large bowl with one cup of softened unsalted butter add one cup of crunchy peanut butter you can use smooth if you don't like the chunks of peanuts it's best to leave the two sticks of butter out on the counter for a couple of hours before you're ready to bake these cream the butter and peanut butter together with one cup of granulated sugar and one packed cup of light brown sugar add two eggs and beat those well then in a separate Bowl sit together two and a half cups of all-purpose flour one teaspoon of baking powder one and a half teaspoons of baking soda and a half teaspoon of salt stir the dry ingredients into the wet ones and mix well to ensure that everything is well incorporated then put the batter in the refrigerator for at least an hour preheat your oven to 375 degrees after the batter has chilled for an hour roll or scoop 1-inch balls and place them on a baking sheet use a fork to flatten each ball and create the classic crisscross pattern on top of the cookie bake them for about 10 minutes until the cookies begin to brown be careful not to over bake them because you want your cookies to be chewy use a spatula to transfer the cookies to a wire rack and let them cool for at least 15 to 20 minutes these cookies are outrageously delicious and with a cup of peanut butter they pack a healthy protein punch you", "e1YIk2WSC3s": "hello and welcome back to my channel today I'm going to show you how to make no baked chocolate peanut butter cookies using just these ingredients it's really easy no bank as I said so you don't need to even pop the oven on you can just pop all the ingredients together in the fridge and then in a couple of hours you'll have easy homemade cookies and as always I've written a blog

subscribe for more videos comment to let me know if you give this recipe a try and what you think of it so let's talk through the ingredients we've got peanut butter I've got peanut butter and cocoa powder oil this is cacao powder and give one that I get from Aldi that's my chocolate peanut butter ingredients I'm using stevia as my sweetener of choice but you could use any sweetener or if you're not following low-carb keto you could just use any sugar you like and I'm using butter but you can use coconut oil instead and I've got the instructions for that in the blog post down below so if you want it to be dairy-free and there could be vegan as well you can skip the butter and go coconut oil instead and you'll still have lovely cookies I've got desiccated coconut over here you can use shredded coconut instead and I'm using flaked almonds I've got flight a bag of flaked almonds over here but you can really use any other chopped nuts you like instead but I just love it with flaked almonds it's kind of perfect so it will get everything combined together now we're going to start with a cup of flaked almonds this is a half a cup measure I'm just gonna do two of these cuz I just need to keep using a half a cup so just make sense so that is a two halfs a whole cup of flaked almonds and a half a cup of coconut and you just toss this around to combine it's good to just get these ingredients all ready to go because next we're gonna melt the butter and when that is all melted together we want to just quickly combine it together so this is combined and now we're gonna get a saucepan and mix all the other ingredients together so but my saucepan over here we're gonna pop in 50 grams of butter which I've just cubed up now it's up to you how sweet you want it you can go a third to half a cup I've got a bit of a shallow half a cup here of stevia you go a quarter of a cup of cocoa powder to make it nice and chocolatey smells good already and then 1/2 a cup of peanut butter into the saucepan and now we're just going to pop it over medium heat and get everything melted and smooth and creamy so I've got over the stove and just give it our mix keep a close watch of it and the butter will slowly melt and just help it along done it to kind of burn and bubble just till we've got a nice creamy mixture that's getting that it's barely been a minute the butter is starting to melt you can see there I'm just helping it along the way and any minute now I'll be able to just take it off the heat and have a lovely creamy mixture I've taken it off the heat you can see this beautiful creamy mixture and now we'll mix it in with the nuts okay I've got my nuts and coconut mixture back and now we'll pour over the chocolate peanut butter mixture just toss it through until we've got a nice cookie dough that's beautiful you can see it doesn't take long and it's coming together beautifully beautiful now I have lined a well greased face with baking paper and we'll drop a good tablespoon or so per cookie onto the cookie sheet just like that just help it along format however you like and we're just gonna fill the cookie tray with cookies just like that and I've got 12 lovely quite big sized tbsp cookies out of my dough if you want to do more bite size ones you can make small ones and make more cookies we like these big beautiful ones that just are almost like a meal a cookie meal but they're gonna go into the fridge to harden for a few hours and I will show you once they're set and the cookies have been in the fridge for a few hours and you take a closer look you can see they sit beautifully it's nice and hard underneath and just what you'd expect from a cookie and if you're a fan of those peanut butter chocolate peanut butter cups this is kind of what it tastes like it's nutty and chocolaty and just so amazing but that is the video for today for these lovely chocolate peanut butter cookies that I'm no-bake and super super easy to make

and chair here today's recipe is no baked banana peanut butter cookies so simple so delicious you're gonna love them so let's get started so I'm just going to get started here by mashing up a banana then I'm going to combine it with four tablespoons of peanut butter and I've just put this in the microwave for about 30 seconds a cup and a quarter of oats a pinch of salt just to bring out the flavor a couple of tablespoons of honey I'm going to grab my handy dandy spatula here and mix everything until it's well combined now what you want to do is grab up oh I'd say about a heaping tablespoon fold it really depends on how big you want your cookie place it in the palm of your hand and simply roll it into a ball and just as a tip what I usually do is place them in the fridge for a few hours because there's so much nicer chilled and there you have the guys it doesn't get much easier than this are no-bake peanut butter banana cookies well they're cookies but they're actually

we are going back in the past to our elementary school cafeteria remember these cookies oh my gosh I love these cookies either you love them or you hate them and I love them so much so today we're gonna make a batch of peanut butter oatmeal no bake cookies let's go all right the ingredients are pretty doggone simple I remember the cafeteria lady made these from scratch in a big old pot first we're gonna do is add some butter to a nonstick skillet then go ahead and just stir it around you don't have to stir it around but something about melting butter is she's so fun to stir and watch it melt I love that yeah kind of weird kind of weird all right when your butter has melted go ahead and throw in a little bit of our milk go ahead and just stir that right on in there gonna add in the sugar this guy have a lot of sugar and you see why kids really love this these cookies because they are full of sugar they're very very sweet but it is what it is I have my heat on medium is gonna stir this up really good and then right before it comes to a boil we're gonna throw in some cream of tartar this is a little trick I learned to keep this tongue cookie from becoming like crusty and sugary all right now we're gonna bring it to a rolling boil like this and the sort that come to this ball we're gonna count two minutes okay one Mississippi two Mississippi only two minutes don't go over two minutes don't go under two minutes it has to be two minutes okay it does yeah all right so once you have two minutes are up go ahead and remove it from that heat all right and it look just like this still kind of you know syrupy whatever we're gonna throw in our peanut butter now if you can get your hands on some of that government peanut butter oh my gosh that stuff tastes gross but in these cookies they were the bomb I'm using Skippy because I just wanted to have that you know nostalgic old-fashioned taste and Skippy is yeah I love Skippy all right so go and throw in some vanilla extract okay just go and stir this all up until you have a nice thick peanut buttery pace go ahead and throw in half of your oatmeal I'm using um the one minute oatmeal because I don't like the old-fashioned kind in this recipe it's too big like a horse eating it just it's too much okay so then go ahead and gonna pour in the rest of our milk all right that's not a little trick I want for my grandmother if you save half the milk and pour it in at the end of it and not write the beginning it'll make a nice creamy cookie and they'll stay creamy for days okay so go ahead and stir that milk and then we're going to add the rest of our oats throw that in my mother used to make the chocolate kind for us almost every day after school you can never have too many no baked cookie recipes I'm sorry you can't we're going to drop these on our parchment paper and we gonna let them set up now you bought it boil it too long it's going to be like dry and crumbly if you don't boil it long enough it will not say it okay so make sure you boil it for two minutes if you go a little bit under ten minutes you storm the fridge and let them sit but yeah and I hear you should make this on rainy days I don't know if that's true or not but they say they won't set up on rainy days counter be on go ahead and let them set up for about 20 minutes and they will get nice and firm as they cool off and then that's it wasn't that easy the easiest peanut butter no bake cookies ever these are my favorite and my cafeteria let me know what was your favorite cafeteria food because we all had our favorites you know and of course you can find the recipe on my blog at divas cook calm thank you guys so much for watching talk to you later bye", "seGQWIiJjHg": "Hi guys, I'm Caroline. And I'm Alejandra.\nAnd today we're making Old Fashioned Peanut Butter Cookies. It's one of my favorite recipes\nto make because it's super simple and it's perfect for a bake sale. Just has a couple\nof ingredients. We have an entire jar of Smooth Operator peanut butter, we have a stick of\nsoftened butter, some light brown sugar, all-purpose flour, egg, and baking powder. So we're just\ngonna get started. All we're gonna do is cream together this softened butter and our jar\nof peanut butter. The whole jar? Exactly! That's amazing. Now add the brown sugar. And\nso I'm just gonna blend this peanut butter, sugar, and butter together. Now that this\nis nice and smooth and the sugar's all combined with the butter and the peanut butter we can add\nour egg. And you're just gonna beat it in until it's incorporated, really easy. And\nthen I like to keep the mixer on low just to avoid any accidents. I add the flour and\nthe baking powder. So perfect. There you go, it's a nice thick dough and it's perfect for\nthat classic crosshatch fork action that we're about to do, so. Sweet! Which we'll do together\nright now. Perfect. So we're just gonna take some of these tablespoon measures and make\nnice, even, little balls and I'll make a couple more. Easy. And so we'll take these forks.\nWe're just gonna make a really simple crosshatch action, which just helps depress the cookies\nso that when they're baking it just helps them spread a little bit, it makes them nice\nand chewy. And pretty too. Yeah, and so we're just gonna finish filling up this sheet, then\nwe're gonna pop them in the oven at 375 for 10-12 minutes. The cookies have been out of\nthe oven for a minute so they're nice and warm and it smells awesome. Smells so good. And\nas you could see we really could load up this cookie sheet because these cookies actually\ndon't spread that much because of how we pushed them down. And there you have it: Old Fashioned\nPeanut Butter Cookies. Are you ready to give it a try? Oh, I'm very ready! All right. This\none. That perfect like crumbly, peanut buttery cookie. You can't find a better or easier\nrecipe. These are awesome, I just need a glass of milk and I'm good to go. Nothing beats\na classic treat like this Old Fashioned Peanut Butter Cookie.

remington james for making these anabolic peanut butter cookies cannot wait to dive into these bad boys because i'm getting really hungry right now and the anabolic windows closing guys i only got like five minutes left before we hop into the ingredients though i gotta preheat the oven to 350 degrees but wait this video is missing something i know some of you guys have missed the spiderman apron from the last video so i had to put this on but guys let's head into this video because i am starving remember don't forget to smash that like button if you're new to the channel please subscribe not gonna lie sometimes i feel like a commercial when i say that but it does mean the world to me i appreciate the love i appreciate the support hit that subscribe button and let's make these cookies baby so guys to make any of these recipes on this channel you need a food scale otherwise if you don't need one and you can just eyeball everything i need your eyes because that's just freaking insane so just get a full scale guys it's gonna be worth it they're like ten dollars on amazon definitely get one but the additional thing you need is a bowl so let's hop right into the ingredients so we just need some peanut butter powder i have pb fit he has pb2 it's the same thing but we need 64 grams of this stuff next we just need 85 grams of greek non-fat plain yogurt now the next thing we need is just 35 milliliters or 35 grams of water so it should be looking something like that [Music] now we just gotta mix it around [Music] so that's what it should be looking like now we're just going to be adding 31 grams of protein i had this peanut popcorn from my protein this stuff is awesome so just 31 grams now we just need 14 grams of coconut flour now we just need 10 grams of sweetener either splenda bag five pound bag pretty cheap so his recipe costs for 21 grams of sugar-free honey i don't have honey i'm not gonna go to the store and get that right now so i had miss butters worth sugar-free syrup it should be pretty good i mean this is thick and rich just like the honey we love it thick and rich super thick and rich and the last ingredient we need is just three grams of baking powder and now we're just gonna get to mix them [Music] [Music] so i got some on my finger i'm gonna do a little taste test for you oh that is pretty damn good but we gotta see when it's done cooking though was that awkward i think that was just a little awkward but i'm gonna get a pan out we're gonna cook these for about five to seven minutes five minutes if you want a little bit more soft seven minutes if you want a little bit more crispy you know what let me just do it right in the middle we're gonna cook these for six minutes hit it with some nonstick and wow my fingers get really sticky from this stuff i might have to wet my fingertips wetting your fingertips can really help because they avoid the sticking so this does make six cookies regular size cookies you can make them smaller if you want to um there is just some left in the bowl i mean i couldn't like just spread that out on more cookies but to be honest i kind of went just like the bowl brings me back to simpler times when i was a kid but i'm gonna bake these cookies for about six minutes and then we're gonna try these out hopefully they live up to my expectation because i freaking love cookies so remington you better not disappoint me like i said the batter is pretty good it's alright but hopefully his cookies uh live up to my expectation like i said but drop a comment down below let me know what your favorite cookie is so i'm not gonna lie never really liked baking until like probably a couple months ago honestly i don't really crave that much sweets i'm a salty kind of guy but the three things that i freaking love reese's brownies and chocolate chip cookie dough like i want to make a recipe that combines all three and i know that'd be freaking fantastic so i do have a couple minutes left on a timer i'm going to cut this short and then the next clip you'll see these cookies [Music] all right guys so here are the cookies i'm going to show you one of them it looks pretty promising it is actually really really soft it might be too soft for my liking because i do like a little bit of crunchiness to it so some of them kind of tore off at the bottom too so kind of be conscious of that make sure you use parchment paper instead i should have used parchment paper but it was whatever but let me just try it out honestly it's too dry um i i can't i can't do this like there's the middle yeah i like i already needed like a glass of water or just like some milk or something because man remington i am sorry you didn't pass my cookie test these came out way too soft i had to cook a little bit longer in the oven the taste is all right i don't know if it's because of the protein powder i use but you know my protein a lot of the flavors are really good to begin with and they're freaking cheap too so yeah i can't i'm not going to make these again it's worth the try though a forever okay like i followed all the ingredients except for the honey that really shouldn't make or break it but i'm sorry this yeah i i can't way too dry i'm just gonna have this one cookie so is this worth it for the gains no is it anabolic af yes even though this isn't the greatest recipe he made the macros and the calories are 520 calories 34 grams of carbs 11.5 grams of fat and 66 grams of protein now these cookies are slightly less in calories than his because of the syrup like i said a for

making no-bake peanut butter cookie balls they are delicious it just hits three simple ingredients that's right three rule of three so the first ingredient you need is Oh a stick of butter that you will melt in the microwave for 30 seconds certain half a cup half a cup or a whole stick or full stick or eight tablespoons butter is usually exactly one and a half cups of peanut butter and superbly jiff you can get it Walmart in the peanut butter aisle then help me cut the power sugar leaves two and a half cups of powder looks lately I got tears in my eyes she left me I'm taking it on the dry pot so the first thing that we're gonna do is put that butter in the bowl put it in the bowl pop it in the microwave off it in the microwave and T you're up you're up in the mixer up put that whole stick of butter take it and we are going to walk over to this year microwave over ignore mathematician and find a tire what we've got those toes on those stick it in here you could get up for life something like that and start up and just wait I'm gonna go get food here's where we keep our sins and preferably a big spending lock dish to get something you're unhappy messed up going on I think it was like eight hours I'll get you hovered take it out you can I don't know oh yeah but you want you look at that sir that oh um reading okay so honestly that well we'll give that few more few more seconds in there I wanted to be very nice it very melted at 88 minutes and 54 seconds okay it's done oh and you want to make sure you touch the bowl very lightly to make sure it's not burning hot can that happen don't want to burn your hand to get three burners and diabetes all right and just in case little brothers come down you want to make sure you press stop and cancel so they don't cook up their pizza like blazing hot okay because then they'll rage at you no one wants that which allows you to play your butter chill there for a little while and you want to make sure it's like flat like that like so and go one cue then you got to get the half oh and a half who eyes and don't forget about the house how to get that happen there no half comes another miserable and then one and a half cups of peanut butter so now that we've got our powered sugar in this bowl here we're going to put the peanut butter in next so there's one cup yes talk about just go in here oh gosh peanut butter so hard to get out of a struggle make sure you wash hands before this because I totally did so this is what it looks like right now you got your powdered sugar and your peanut butter and then you're going to add more peanut butter then you have your personal assistant come in the bowl for you and who's not going to cause toss not throw back okay fair you can't waste even a drop of peanut butter and if they get stuck on your finger you can't let it go for ways and we're going on lick it off my my old Earl is what I think now you add the butter that's better all that butter and then I didn't eat it mix mix mix mix mix mix mix and it's all me and the last ingredient that you need that was gruff mention it is a handle in there and you can do many and ends you can do big fat and then them to keep any type of M&Ms you want though you don't worry about everything here we access every M&M just is a day oh haha a big handful of mini and maybe Ben's done because we love chocolate it's good for

else don't forget to drink your water your no-bake peanut butter balls and be a good person Oh [Applause] [Music]", "TGiSf1bGqVk": "[Music] so today we're making crunchy peanut butter cookies and I am obsessed with peanut butter and so am I so if you are - you're going to love this recipe they're loaded with both peanuts and tons of peanut butter and they're crunchy on the outside kind of soft in the middle and you can actually make these ahead of time so I think they're perfect for any summer barbecue or cookout they're a total crowd pleaser what I'm excited about is that I'm a horrible Baker so tessa is here in our kitchen she's gonna show me how to make the perfect cookie yes perfectly uniform everyone will want this recipe so this recipe were actually featuring simple truth creamy peanut butter and planter's dry roasted peanuts all of the ingredients in this recipe are shown below and they're available at your Kroger family store which is fries where I'm from in Phoenix hey guys it's Tessa from handle the heat comm and Alex and Sonja from a couple cooks welcome to our summer barbecue series we are so excited to be teaming up together and with prokhor your one-stop shop for summer entertaining and we are whipping up healthy real food recipes from a couple cooks wait delicious baked treats from handle the heat so let's go ahead and dive on it so let's go ahead and get started with the dry ingredients I have all-purpose flour and I always like to weigh my flour when I'm baking because it just makes it 100% accurate it's actually super easy to accidentally compact way too much flour into your measuring cup which can lead to dry dense cookies which we obviously don't want so if you're not using a scale be sure you're spooning your flour into your measuring cups that you don't accidentally add way too much so to the flour I'm going to add both baking powder and baking soda and now why do you use both the baking powder and baking soda yeah that's a really good question so I like to use both because the baking soda actually helps to create more browning and spread and the baking powder helps to create a little bit more lift and height but I actually have a whole video comparing baking soda to baking powder I'll link that down below for you guys and then I'm also gonna add a little bit of salt because that will help bring out that peanut butter flavor in the sweetness and what type of salt do you like to use in your I like to use fine salt so either table salt or fine sea salt I find that kosher salt can accidentally have too much of a salty taste and flavor because the coarse granules are just a little bit too large so I'm just going to give this a quick stir my dry ingredients so now we're gonna move on to creaming the butter and sugar so I have one and a half sticks of unsalted butter I always like to bake with unsalted butter it allows you to control the amount of salt there's actually no standard amount of salt that the government like mandates for salted butter so it could be twice as much as one brand than it is in the other brands so that's why I always like to use unsalted so I'm also using both granulated sugar and brown sugar and now if someone didn't have a stand mixer do they need to have one for this recipe no you could totally use a handheld electric mixer but having the power of the electric mixer really helps to create nice smooth beautiful cookies so you go ahead and close that and we're only gonna beat this for about two to three minutes no longer when you're making a cake you want to beat more air into the butter and sugar but we don't want to do that with cookies if you've ever had cookies that have come out of the oven and they look really tall and then as they cool they deflate into like flat little sad cookies it's probably because you beat too much air into your butter and sugar and the cookie couldn't actually hold the structure of all of that air so just two to three minutes medium high speed okay so I'm gonna add one egg and I always like to have my eggs at room temperature when baking it just makes them mix in a little bit easier and we can beat that in alright so next up is the creamy peanut butter it smells so good I'm just going to scoop that in and I love that this recipe uses peanuts in two forms so you get the perfect amount of peanut butter goodness wait to try that we can be done in as long the next ingredient is a little bit of vanilla extract may I like hardly ever measure my vanilla I just kind of eyeball it so lastly I'm just going to add in the dry ingredients and give it a quick mix starting on those feeds you don't end up with flour all over the kitchen [Music] okay and lastly I'm going to add in a cup a cup of the peanuts give us that crunchy extra burst of peanut goodness and then quickly mix it up so we're going to get started scooping out the cookies onto baking sheet so I'm just going to scoop out about one and a half tablespoon sized balls of cookie dough and I like to use parchment paper to line my sheets all right the next step is actually to roll the cookie dough in some granulated sugar which is also going to help you with that crunchy exterior so what I like to do is actually you can grab one of the pieces of dough and roll it in between your palms this is going to give it a really beautiful picture-perfect appearance and then you just roll it in the sugar and then pop it back on the baking sheet and then you're actually going to take a fork and make an X on top and press the cookie down they want to spread out too much so we kind of want to help them by pressing them down [Music] and then they'll go in a 375 degree oven for about 10 to 12 minutes or until they're just lightly golden at the edges all right so the cookie the last batch they're done baking so these gotta cool until they're completely cool cuz we don't to burn ourselves although it's hard to wait these are perfect for the glass of milk too they look amazing are you guys excited to taste that do we get to but before we do I just wanted to quickly say I think these are perfect for any barbecue because you can actually make the dough ahead of time and refrigerate it for up to 72 hours or you can scoop the balls into onto a baking tray and then freeze it once the balls are solid then you can pop them in a resealable container and you can keep those frozen balls up for like I don't know two to three months and then you can bake them from frozen just add a couple minutes to the baking time okay so of it give them a taste test they look amazing yes classic peanut butter cookies right so good and the texture like you said it was perfect yeah don't lucky with this follow the recipe it's listed down below be sure to check out all of the other recipes in our series we'll link to the playlist that will have all of them down below as well [Music]", "tC86NX_rQDk": "[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "003auW98Hmw": "[Music] hi guys I'm

spot flour and one with rice flour and if not if you don't like either of them you can just use regular flour let's get baking so first step i'm doing unsalted butter and we've got 120 grams and i've already cubed that and it's been at room temperature we're going to whip this up for about 10 minutes we'll be whipping that with our sugar and i've got a combination of castor sugar which is 50 grams which is about a quarter of a cup and 90 grams of dark brown sugar that's about i think half a cup but if you want the full recipe jump over to summery pea.com and you'll see all my other recipes as well or i'll put a link in the description below so let's change color it's really light in color now and fluffy now we've got one egg and i'm just going to beat that a little bit and i'm going to add in a teaspoon of vanilla i'm just going to blend that until it's combined just on low in the meantime you might want to get your flour ready i've pre-sifted my flour so i'm using spelt flour in the first recipe today and i've got 150 grams which is one cup plus a quarter of a cup so i've got 15 grams of cocoa powder which is two tablespoons and i've got a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and a quarter of a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda that should be fine now we're going to gently add the flour so we add it but just gently combine it that's what i mean we're using 90 grams of crunchy peanut butter but if you don't like crunchy you can use smooth okay so we want to just combine this i'm just transferring it into a smaller bowl so i can chill at these balls too big for my fridge chill out cookie dough for 30 to 45 minutes stick around because i've still got the rice flour ones to do now for our second version our rice flour version i'm using an organic brown rice flour really soft so let's make it in the cookies and see how it compares to the spill one so first step we're gonna cream our butter and sugar together so we've got half a cup or 120 grams of unsalted butter once again i've combined dark brown sugar which is 90 grams plus 50 grams of white sugar let's just stop that and see how it's going so we're just going to beat our egg this step isn't important that you need to do it in this process it's more just my little method to ensure that i don't forget my vanilla so add that in pre-sifted brown rice flour quarter of a teaspoon of salt quarter of a teaspoon of bicarb soda and two tablespoons of cocoa powder just throwing that all in we've got our crunchy peanut butter 90 grams or half a cup i'm going to chill this and grab the other one out so we've got our cookie dough out of the fridge and we're ready to start popping them on the tray so i've lined my baking tray i'm just using an ice cream scoop so now we're going to bake these in our preheated oven for roughly about 10 to 15 minutes i'll have a look at them at 12 minutes our baking's all complete and here we have our two cookies for the taste test our spelt and our rice flour let's try the spelt one first mmm crunchy it's soft mmm tastes really good i'll try the rice flour one for some reason my rice flour one is a lot more puffy i think i might have added an extra quarter of a teaspoon of baking soda the texture is definitely different rice flour tastes like a soft shortbread so it's more grainy and crumbly still tastes pretty good anyway let me know which one you like and which you prefer and don't go anywhere i've got more videos that you can watch and don't forget subscribe if you're new here hit the bell and then you get notified as soon as i've got a new video released and

going to make something very sweet in our instant vortex airfryer oven we are going to make three ingredient peanut butter cookies so what you will need is you'll need a cup of sugar which i've already added into my bowl one egg and one cup of peanut butter i also have here some chocolate chips because i am going to add some chocolate chips into my second batch of cookies because i thought that would taste good kind of like a reese's peanut butter cup we have our two trays right here these are nonstick so i'm not going to spray them down with any cooking spray i have not had anything really stick to these yet so you need both your trays we're only going to be able to put one tray in here at a time since we have to cook it in the middle rack and you will need an old school hand mixer you will also need a fork to make our little design in our peanut butter cookies and a cooling rack and a spatula for removing the cookies off of the airfryer rack when they're done cooking so let's get started okay so in my bowl i already have one cup of sugar to that i'm going to go ahead and add in my cup of peanut butter and if you would like to double the recipe then go ahead and add two cups of sugar two cups of peanut butter and two eggs and add one egg to your bowl all right now it's time to mix up our little batter here so we're gonna just put this on low to start with and get everything nice and creamed together turn it up a little bit [Applause] until you're left with a batter that looks something like this all right so once all of our dough is mixed up we're gonna go ahead grab a little bit of the dough you're gonna roll it in your hands to form a small ball shape like this and we're going to set this on our tray and you can go ahead and make as many as you'd like to for your first tray try to make them about the same size and leave some space because we still have to press these down with the fork and what we're going to do now is take our fork once you have all the balls of cookie dough that you're going to place on your tray on here go ahead and take your fork and you're going to want to do a crisscross pattern you're going to want to press down on your cookie dough this way and then that way to make a nice little design in all of your cookies all right so your cookie should look something like this and now we're going to plug our airfryer in and get it heating up all right so my instant airfryer vortex is plugged in i'm going to hit the bake button and i'm going to put it on 350 degrees we're gonna go for five minutes so hit the time button down to five minutes and then press start [Music] your vortex will begin to heat up and when it's ready it's going to beep and tell you to add your food so while i was heating up i'm going to go ahead and work on my second tray of peanut butter cookies all right so once our vortex airfryer oven has heated up we want to go ahead and place our cookies in the center rack close the door and let these bake for five minutes [Music] all right so for my second rack i just dumped in a little bit chocolate chip cookies and i stirred it into the batter with a spoon and now i'm going to press these down the same way that we did the first rack with our fork got the second rack of cookies pushed down with my fork and ready to go into the oven these ones have 38 seconds of counting all right guys we have

healthy you", "zpxV_LMfuxU": "hi i'm cherylin from cherry Lynn's cupcakes and today I will show you how to make soft peanut butter chop chip cookies first you'll need an egg 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt you will need 1 cup of plain flour 1/2 a cup of castor sugar and half a cup of firmly packed light brown sugar you will also need to have 3/4 of a cup of peanut butter you can choose whatever peanut butter you like my favorite is this craft crunching peanut butter annually one cup of chocolate chips as well as half a cup of butter which is 113 grams firstly you put your butter into a large mixing bowl be sure your butter is soft it'll be much easier for you to whisk it later on and once that's done you add in your half a cup of castor sugar and then you add in your brown sugar you really don't need a electric mixer for this you can use the hand whisk like what I'm doing here that's why I said make sure your butter is soft it would be so much easier for you to whisk so I'm just going to use my whisk to mix it all up until the butter and sugar are completely combined and is light and fluffy and looks something like this once that's done you can crack in one egg and then you just whisk that up mix it real good until everything is combined and then you can add in your vanilla and you whisk that too once that's done you can now add in your peanut butter and Here I am using crafts crunchy peanut butter and it is absolutely the most delicious peanut butter I have ever tried and I have tried so many different brands of peanut butter and seriously craft is amazing but if you can't get craft peanut butter in your country I guess find what of peanut butter you've tried that is your favorite and most tastiest and delicious stay away from those organic ones because that is going to ruin the taste of these delicious cookies so you mix it in until it's all smooth like this then in a separate Bowl you mix together your dry ingredients of the baking powder and the salt once you're done with that you just add that into the butter mixture add it in in two parts so that it would be easier for you to combine it and when all of those combined you add in your cup of chocolate chips here I'm just using some semi-sweet chocolate chips buy her shoes and once I've added it in I realize I wanted more chocolate chips so added more and folded it in with a spoon during this time my oven is already preheated at 175 degrees Celsius so once you're done with mixing all of that up you just roll it into balls like take little spoonfuls and put it on your baking sheet and make into balls if the mixture is too wet or too yeah too wet to work with you can just stick it in the fridge for a little while until they firm up a little it would be much easier for you to roll into little balls and once you put it into the oven make sure the heat comes from just the top of the oven if that makes sense like not from the top and the bottom and put it in for 12 minutes check it after 6:00 to make sure it doesn't burn and once the edges are just starting to brown you can remove it cookies tend to cook really quickly so be sure you keep an eye on them and lower the temperature if necessary when you remove it from the oven the cookies will still be soft so don't worry it will continue cooking as they cool on your tray do not remove it until they are completely cooled and there you'll have it absolutely delicious soft peanut butter chop chip cookies I hope you've enjoyed this video and till next time I'm Cheryl and from cherry lanes cupcakes", "FAFlJbTeJDM": "today we're making these delicious white chocolate chip peanut butter cookies [Music] these are all the ingredients you're going to need to make the cookies so foster your flour you're going to add in your baking powder and baking soda and then you're going to mix it all together and set the flour side in another bowl you're going to take your butter and both the sugars beat this for about one to two minutes once your mixture is nice and creamy you're going to add in your egg and beat for one more minute [Music] then you're going to add in your creamy peanut butter and your vanilla extract beat this on high speed for two minutes till everything is well combined [Music] then you're going to add in your flour and beat on low speed just on the flour is nearly combined which is just about a few seconds and then you go to add in your white chocolate chips and beat those in again just for a few seconds and then you can switch to a spatula use the spatula to give the batter a final mix to make sure your cookie dough comes together your cookie dough should be nice and thick just like that and then you're going to cover this and refrigerate it for about one hour or more this will ensure that your cookies remain nice and thick [Music] and then you're going to line your baking tray with some parchment paper [Music] and then I used a small ice cream scoop to scoop out the cookie dough but you can even use about two tablespoons of the dough and you're going to make small balls of it and roll it and granulated sugar this is optional but I really love how the cookies taste with the sugar on top and then you're going to repeat this [Music] [Music] make sure to leave about two inches between the cookie balls and once you're done you're going to bake this in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for about 15 minutes [Music] you can also bake them for about 20 minutes if you want them to be a bit crispy but I love my cookies when they are soft [Music] and then you're going to let these cool on the counter for a while after about 10 minutes you can place them on a wire rack to cool completely I love to eat them while they're still warm because I'm not patient and I really love how they taste right out of the oven so here's me grabbing the first bite of the cookie [Music] the cookie is nice and golden on the bottom and it's a bit crisp on the outside but chewy on the inside it just melts in your mouth as well and the peanut butter is just heavenly these are nice and thick and they feel like you've just got them from the bakery but they're homemade and if you want to surprise your family and friends you should definitely give these a try I [Music] hope you enjoyed this recipe and I'll see you with some more bye",

now let me show you how I kita first things first we're gonna get our butter go ahead and mount it tada the next thing we're gonna do is get our Sukhram which is our brown sugar substitute or you can use your favorite sugar substitute next is swerve or again your favorite sugar substitute now I'd like to melt these two together like once that you know the butter is hot so get these mixed really well it works excellently um you don't have that what do you call that the UM that effect like I guess I call it a minty effect when you're biting into it once the cookie is done so I find that this works best for that it helps eliminate the cooling effect there you go the cooling of fact so we mix this really well and now in a separate Bowl what we're gonna do is get our almond flour now remember I'm using half a recipe for the video so please don't think I'm cheating you guys let me get our unsweetened organic coconut flakes and half a teaspoon of the pink Himalayan and then we're going to mix it together I like to do this part and take my time with it to get all the lumps out of that almond flour remember to visit my website for the full recipe you're gonna get your two eggs and you're gonna scramble them or beat them whichever phrase you prefer or wording there I'm gonna get your cup of raw salted nuts and chop them up roughly then into this mixture we're gonna go ahead and add I just want you to look at that so you see what it looks like when you're making it right the peanut butter is not in there yet we're getting there so now we're gonna go ahead and add our dry flour mix right our dry mix to the wet mix I'm gonna dump it in there and then just stir it up really good in a moment we're gonna Abbey yep and the chopped up nuts and our eggs now extract I'm giving you guys the measurements so I hope you guys can appreciate that because for the whole year I didn't do it and I did read all the comments that you guys wanted the the recipe mmm part of my reasoning

and that way you can make these delicious cookies that everyone in your family will love here's your cup of smooth peanut butter I like to use I'm not sponsored by them but I do use the Kirkland brand because it's only peanuts and salt nothing extra so go ahead and mix that in there really well and let me tell you as I'm doing this it smells delicious already and I had to make these because I had this really really huge peanut butter craving lately so it's delicious I promise so once you mix it up really really really well move on to the next step so here I have my lined baking sheet and I'm gonna take a tablespoon at a time of the peanut butter dough and I'm gonna roll it into a ball just like that and then I'm gonna press it and make a cross hatch pattern with a fork and it does get a little sticky so take your time with it that's how we do this now once again guys remember to visit my website at www.utahparentcenter.org ah look at that you look amazing now we're off to the oven to bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 350 degrees now look at this it was amazing not burnt just perfect YUM I hope you enjoyed this guy's remember to follow me on social media and until next time this is how Aikido", "f3XaaquWfR8": "hey how you doing Jax got funny here and today we're making low-carb peanut butter cookies because I need something for dessert I gotta tell you something thank God for almond and coconut flour because it lets us replace regular flour so today we're using coconut flour we're using Splenda peanut butter eggs salt and vanilla extract first thing I wanna remind you is to get the all-natural peanut butter because all-natural peanut butter has less sugar you want to get all natural or make your own if you know how to make peanut butter salt vanilla extract flour in and your sucralose and last but not least your eggs and you're gonna mix these until combined now here's a quick tip take nonstick spray and spray your scooper you may have to do it more than once if you do like a double batch you don't want to you don't want there things to stick to it there you go all right now these aren't gonna raise that much so what you want to do is drop them about an inch or two apart from each other okay once you've laid out all your cookies you want to go back and round them in your hands to give them a smooth surface because you're going to mash them once you've crisscross the cookies you're gonna put in an oven at 350 degrees 15 to 17 minutes or until the edges are golden crispy there you go here we go mmm what foods mm-hmm all right these cookies are good but you got to drink it with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk I'm telling you they're a little dry but when you take a sip of coffee the cream up really good really excited about this so write down the recipe down below I'll see you in the next episode I love you bye", "SyxuDuA92q0": "today we're making classic peanut butter cookies you're gonna need 1 cup of butter 3/4 a cup of packed brown sugar 3/4 a cup of white sugar 1 cup of peanut butter 2 eggs 2 and a half cups of flour 1 teaspoon of baking powder 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and we're gonna make some great cookies so let's get started all right the first thing that we're gonna do is we want to cream our butter then what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour in the white sugar and then I'm going to put in the two eggs crack one of these crack the next one so we'll get our first day again and we'll incorporate that I'm going to get the next day again coorporate that now at this point we're going to put in the brown sugar so let me grab a spoon and we'll get the brown sugar in break that up a little bit now we'll incorporate the sugar okay once you've done a good job at incorporating all that we're gonna get our peanut butter in next peanut butter it let's incorporate that now we're ready for all of the other ingredients so let's get all of you baking powder baking soda and salt in there and we'll get that well incorporated okay at this point we're ready for the flower I'm just going to start putting a little bit of flour in at a time go slowly at first so you don't make a big cloud of dust you're going to love this recipe this makes a beautiful beautiful cooking and it's so easy to make and then I'll add in a little bit more flour the reason why you want to add flour and little bunches like that is that you want to make sure that your dough is it's well incorporated with all you know and get the flour into the into the batter properly you don't want to have lumps this just ensures that you get a nice even batter right a little bit more get this going this smells really good right now whether or not it that's not even big okay and now we're ready for the last a little bit of flour just get that in there I'll get this mixed up and we'll be back all right we're back I've cleaned up my work area I've got myself a cookie sheet here and a little scoop ice cream scoop so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take little scoops and we're gonna get them you about 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit so I'm going to continue on doing this and we'll come back in a minute you alright okay wait what you can do now is get your just get a little bit of flour get a fork and you can just do the little traditional cross you all right let's pop some cookies in and we'll be back all right the cookies have now been in for a total of 12 minutes I decided to go with 12 and add an extra two because they are quite large let's check them out those look awesome and they just smell amazing anyway let's get them over to the work area and we'll get them onto a cooling sheet cooling tray all right let's check these ever they smell amazing you want to get them onto a cooling rack I set up my I have to move my camera back over here and just in that two-minute time you can actually see that these cookies overall are already starting to set up never take cookies off the rack right away because the fats inside are so hot that the cookies will actually collapse on you so if you wait a couple of minutes just before taking them off you'll do a great job doing that you don't have any problems just to show you something look at how many cookies this recipe is gonna make Louie we've got left and batter this is a very big bowl of batter I leave how many cookies and these are these are very large cookies so this here is going to last you a long time here's a little tip if you want to have fresh cookies like we just did here but you don't want to make this whole batter what you can do is you can take some plastic wrap and take the rest of this batter and put it in the plastic wrap and roll it up and roll they roll it into a sausage kind of form and you can put it in the fridge or put it into the freezer and then you can just cut them up and you can just place them on your your cookie sheet and then you can bake them that way you know you what you do is you let the batter or let the cookie dough come to room temperature slice them up put them on and away you go I do have a recipe or a video tip rather that is on the website on one of my other videos maybe a link to it but anyway that's that's a good thing that you can try out if you don't want to make this all at once okay so I've just used my little ice cream scoop I'll just place some dough here I'll just show you what I meant so I don't want to make a bunch more cookies today so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to get all of this squeeze it up into a little roll and what you can do with this get it into the size you want and then fold over your ends so that your dough doesn't dry out and then roll it up and you can put this in the freezer you bring it out and before it's totally defrosted the day that you want to make them don't let it completely defrost like this because it'll be too hard to cut bring it out and then when you feel that it feels like you can cut it just start slicing them into little you know little pieces and then put them on your cookie tray and away you go and there's my oven ready again but anyway there you go so that's another little tip well I'm having my first cookie and I the first bite and I was like oh then these are really good you got to try this recipe don't over do the cookie if you want a crispy your cookie you're going to let it go longer in the oven but I suggest not doing that go to the 10-12 minutes maximum for the size of scoop that I use like this and you're going to get a really really nice tender cookie oh this is so good you got to try this recipe alright that's it for today so I'll see you next time you you you", "k2d_3SH6WGc": "cookies world hello there cookie bin I'm so excited to say the peanut butter family is growing if we are gonna be adding in a brand new family member to this peanut butter family in my previous videos I'm sure you may have seen he creates EB BB and her brother this cute little peanut butter puppy the little itty bitty baby peanut butter sister and their peanut butter mama so now we're gonna be creating the peanut butter Poppa for them so we're gonna be creating him by using this fashionista Kindle right here but I think he would be absolutely perfect for the family because he also has this man bun in the back which is just alike how his sons hairstyle is he's got his really high man bun right on top of his head so that is exactly what we are going to do to his hair so I'm gonna go in with some acrylic paint did you do and I'm now going to paint his hair with his creamy peanut butter color alright say goodbye to brown hair and now we're making a peanut butter hair paint that man bun I can switch over to a smaller brush and that way I can easily paint the details that are a little bit closer to his head there we go easy easy well this is really changing him up look at how different he looks already it's so much fun to paint their hair and see how different they look I think that's so cool alright and once that first coat of paint dries now I'm gonna go in with a second coat and just paint paint paint paint paint just make sure the whole entire head of hair is all covered up no splotchy splotchy [Music] paint that man-bun looks like I'm still gonna go in with a third coat of paint because I'm still seeing some spotty spotty here and that is not allowed a little bit more peanut butter and we'll paint just cover up any of his old hair color would make sure it's nice and covered oh there's a splotchy alright his hair is all done now I'm just gonna go in and darken up his eyes even though it looks like they already are like a light brown color I want him to match his family and have dark brown eyes so I'm going in with one of my favorite paint colors because look at what it's called it is called chocolate bar you guys yum yum makes me feel like I'm painting with real chocolate oh it's so pretty and I'm just gonna go in with a toothpick cuz I need to paint very very very carefully right in his eye and I'm just going to take the tip of my toothpick and just slightly add color and just kind of bounce that paint so I put a little paint and then sometimes I flip it over to my other side and just drag it so a little dot of paint and now drag it with the other side he's got chocolaty dark brown eyes alright there we go now we've darkened his eyes up so he matches with his family so now I'm also going to lighten up his lips a little bit make it more of a peanut buttery color I'm just gonna be using a little teeny tiny touch of this Brown cuz his lips are a little bit too peachy colors I'm just gonna kind of darken them just a little bit to make it a little bit more peanut buttery there we go yes awesome alright now that he has his face completely finished oh you know what we could add we could add an earring also just so like peanut butter boy has he has a little gold earring right here in his ear let's give his dad and hearing too so I'm just gonna use my gold metallic paint right on the back of my toothpick just put a little dot and then we'll just pierce his ear how easy is that I'm a little ear piercing OOP there we go okay we're ready to get started on his clothing now to paint his clothing I should be using fabric paint to make it work the best then the clothing would actually stay kind of movable and easy to you know dress him at all but I want to keep the same colors that I have for the rest of his family so I'm just gonna be using basic acrylic paint so whenever you paint acrylic paint on fabric it can crack it can get really hard and stiff but I'm gonna do exactly what I did here with the peanut butter mama and I'm just going to seal his whole entire outfit in with some Mod Podge so I'm gonna give this a really good shake with a big brush I'm just gonna go in and I guess we should start with his pants first so I'm gonna start by painting his jeans completely with Mod Podge because they are gonna be a totally different color now so this Mod Podge will act as a sealer and it will kind of just kind of help with the cracking that will happen over time with the fabric but to me it's totally worth it because I don't plan on changing out his outfit at all he's just gonna be living in these clothes forever so just paint paint paint then once I have everything covered in Mod Podge and then I'm going to let his pants dry all right now I'm gonna go in with this kind of peanutty butter color everything's like peanut butter color and we're just going to put a little bit on my brush here oh the brush barely fits into the container here we go and now I'm just going to oh there we go paint on directly on the fabric of his shorts it looks a little bit lighter than what I painted on peanut butter boy shorts I'll have to see what it looks like once it dries so just completely paint his shorts here the little piece hanging off of one of the little hairs chunks piece [Music] now I'm just gonna get as close as I can to the top part of the shorts to mostly the top part of his shorts will not be seen because his shirt will cover it a little bit but still I want to get as close as I can and it's okay if I paint on his skin accidentally just a little bit because you can easily just scratch it off once it dries all right and now once that layer dries now I'm gonna go in with more paint and paint on a second coat and his pants color actually did darken up now that it has dried a bit so it's turning out to be the perfect peanut buttery color his pants have now been painted and now we need to work on is a shirt because it totally does not go it is clashing with this outfit so to prime and get it ready go in with that Mod Podge again and seal the fabric on the shirt so seal it all in so crazy well good thing you didn't fall off in the Mod Podge all right once I get everything completely coated on his shirt with this layer of Mod Podge I'm gonna let it dry overnight all right his shirt is now all try so now I'm going to paint it this creamy white color but you guys have heard me talk about this color over and over again because it's called a toasted marshmallow oh look at it - YUM it looks like a melted marshmallow I say that every time but it just makes me so happy now I do want to be a little careful as I pay closer and closer and closer to his shorts because I don't want to get any toasted marshmallow color on it [Music] I'll just go in with a smaller brush whenever I get a little bit close here and if I happen to get some paint on him it easily just scratches away all right that dried pretty nicely but still looking SuperDuper splotchy so we definitely need to go in again with another coat and just paint paint paint [Music] you can probably use another coat of paint I'm still seeing some little splotchy areas and there could be no splotchy so I'm just gonna go in and do another coat of paint on him now it's okay that I'm not painting his collar here because I'm going to end up painting that a brown color but his shirt I definitely want it to be this creamy color under his armpit there we go this looks like the final coat and the back of him all right looking good now I'm gonna have him match his son just a little bit more I think they're gonna be wearing a very similar shirt so he has all of these little darker brown peanuts all over his hoodie so did the same thing for his dad with my dark brown I'm just going to cover his shirt in these itty bitty teeny tiny peanuts I mean there's gonna be like a million on his shirt whoo he's gonna have a one nutty shirt [Music] there's one side done now the other [Music] all right now we need to add peanuts to the back might as well right let's just go nuts I have this brown color out I might as well match his shoes too now I'm gonna go back to his shirt and I'm actually going it to paint this little detail piece all the way down and his collar so we'll just go back in with that brown and just paint I think this is gonna look perfect it's gonna add just enough color to his shirt and of course he's gonna match with the rest of his family [Music] now I'm gonna paint all the way down his shirt [Music] [Music] and once that dries of course I'm gonna go in with a second coat I'm gonna go back into and actually put those peanuts on his actual sleeve as well so he's just covered in peanuts all over I'm gonna go in with a little detail brush and just kind of clean up the line here and get a little bit smoother and cover her up any areas that I accidentally painted out of the lines just cover that up there we go and then just kind of buff it out all right now I'm going to see you everything in with a coat of Mod Podge so everywhere I paint it it's just gonna get all sealed and I'm even gonna go over his lips and his eyes since I gave him new eye color and I'm gonna paint his hair and shoes yang can't forget about his tiny little earring all right where is he what does the peanut butter dad look like here he is I think he fits in so perfectly with the family so here they are all together I am so excited with how he turned out I'm so happy that Barbie now makes these man-bun dolls cuz it just it worked out absolutely perfect for him so him and his son I have that same peanutty crazy shirt I love that they all have that same color combo going on that peanut butter and rich and creamy color it just works out so perfectly so this is the peanut buttery family of course we can't forget about jelly I wonder what her mom and dad looked like so

the bowl to make sure that there is no ingredients at the bottom that have not been mixed in [Music] now i'm going to be adding in the butter and i'm going to start mixing the butter in with the dry ingredients once the batter is mixed in a little bit i'm gonna scrape down the paddle again and i'm going to add in the egg and mix it in now you want to scrape the bowl down to make sure everything

we're going to be testing a recipe that someone sent to me and it's for three ingredient peanut butter cookies and there's literally just three ingredients unless you decide to throw some add-ins but we're gonna test it and see how it comes out it's a really simple recipe in fact I don't even have it in front of me it's one cup of peanut butter one cup of sugar and one egg so it's pretty easy to memorize you cook it on 350 for about ten minutes so we're gonna go through the process actually have everything measured out so I have a cup of peanut butter and I have one cup of sugar and then one large egg typically in baking if they just say an egg you're always going to use a large egg unless they specify so we're gonna get started and I have the oven preheating behind us and we're gonna see how this comes out so I'm actually gonna whip this up by hand today I'll let you know if it's worth it maybe it's gonna be a lot of work it may be easier to pull out a mixer but I don't feel like it and the recipe doesn't specify so we have our bowl here with 1 cup of peanut butter and I'm gonna add to that our 1 cup of sugar the one thing I would personally change right off the bat I would add a pinch of salt but it doesn't ask for it so we're not going to so we're gonna add our 1 egg and then I'm just gonna grab a wooden spoon and start mixing this by hand I'll let you know if you should use a mixer No so in the recipe there was some talk about using creamy peanut butter versus crunchy peanut butter and in this particular recipe there's recipes for this all over but in this particular one she didn't say do not use crunchy peanut butter that it just hasn't really come together very well so we're using smooth she did not say anything about natural peanut butter versus regular peanut butter now this time if three different kinds of peanut butter you have your standard peanut butter that has sugar and everything added to it then you have your natural peanut butter which still has some oil added to it those are like your Skippy and your Jeff peanut butters and that's actually what I'm using here and they just pulled together better and it doesn't separate so then you have your fully natural peanut butter which may just have some salt in it and those ones separate a lot your oil separates out from the nuts so I didn't use that and I'm gonna guess that would probably be a problem in this recipe but I can't swear to that she did another mess that I think I may have seen that in other recipes this actually came together pretty easily it's a very thick but it's pretty smooth I'm just gonna go for another minute to make sure all that sugar is incorporated in here we don't get in a really sweet spots now you could at this point if you wanted throw in a splash of vanilla or some chocolate chips oops sorry about the noise there um you can do them throwing some crushed peanuts now at this point because it's already come together so if you do want a crunchy you could throw in some nuts and now if you're pretty good all right I'm gonna say that that's together so I have two baking sheets set up here with parchment paper on them and the recipe said to divide into one tablespoon scoops and then she said don't leave them in mounds because they won't spread and so you're gonna press them down with a fork so have a scoop here and I never really know if these are a tablespoon or what they are but I'm gonna assume this is a tablespoon and I think it's pretty standard so we're gonna start with one sheet and I'm just gonna I like to use the skirt because they're always even you get all the same size cookies so I like to use that so we're gonna do 12 on the sheet so they're not going to spread a lot because there's no butter in this recipe so that's why we have to press them down so once we do they won't spread a ton so they should not run into each other they're mostly gonna stay exactly as we set them after we cross them down [Music] all right we're just gonna take the tines of your fork and there's a lot of oil in here because of the peanut butter so they should not stick but if you found that they were sticking at all you could Obie's dip your fork in some sugar and I don't want to add any extra sugar to the recipe but you could sprinkle some coarse sugar over the top if you like that or you could roll them in sugar before you press them down [Music] okay so we have them all put out on the sheet pan I got about 20 cookies out of this they might be a little big maybe they're a little bit more than a tablespoon so the recipe says to cook them for 10 minutes since mine may be a little big I'll cook them for 10 minutes check them it says until golden brown it's very difficult to check golden brown when you're cooking something that's already brown but we should be able to see if the edges start getting some color on them and that would be the point that we would want to pull them out so I'm gonna get them in the oven and then I will see you guys again in about 10 minutes all right it has been 13 minutes I took them out of the oven I let me go for a few minutes longer because like I said these might be a little bit bigger plus my oven is really big and so sometimes takes a little longer to cook in there they didn't really get any kind of dark golden brown but I don't know they smell delicious and they look done now the recipe was very specific saying that they have to be left to cool on the sheet for a few minutes because they're super fragile and then you have to move on with a wide spatula and then let them cool completely on a baking rack so can't taste them yet so I'm just going to stand here and smell them which if you love peanut butter I love peanut butter it smell really good so just going to wait it out the length of 26 [Music] they don't seem very fragile but I imagine they could come apart pretty easily at this point but they're not careful oh my god they do smell very good I know I keep saying that that's because they smell very good okay so I'm thinking we should try one wall they are warm and maybe I'll come back to Taiwan and they're cool but I'll definitely put what I think in the description below or the link will be in the description below along with any extra directions or anything that I thought of or anything that maybe could improve it well we don't know it may not need improving it may be perfect as it is so here we go it's still pretty warm it still smells good all right well for me it's a very sweet I don't need a lot of sugar anymore but it tastes really good and for a normal cookie it's probably no sweeter than a normal cookie and actually holds together pretty well it's still a little bit wet in the center but that may just be either my oven or that I made them a little bit too big but if you like a soft cookie this is this is actually pretty good the only thing I'm gonna say at this point I would probably changed well I already said I would put a little salt in it which would definitely help with the sweet factor I think I'd mix it with a mixer as you can still sort of feel the Greens of sugar crunching in your teeth and that's probably because there's no butter or anything and so it didn't really have time mixing it by hand like that for the sugar to really break down so if you mix it with a mixer it may encourage the sugar to break down more because there's not a lot of liquid in it that one egg was just not enough liquid to really dissolve the sugar so I would say you probably mix it with a mixer and give it a couple more minutes you can't over mix this because there's no flour in it so you're not endangering what we're mixing it so that's not going to matter but for a super quick three ingredient cookie that you don't need a recipe for one cup peanut butter 1 cup sugar 1 egg and put it in the oven at 350 for I'll say 10 to 12 minutes I mean you really can't go wrong so I would say this is definitely something I would keep and use any time I'm in a pinch and especially if you are gluten intolerant if you have any issues with wheat this would be a fantastic option for you so thank you for joining me again today again all the the link to the website any instructions or anything will be put in the description below and please like and subscribe and I look forward to seeing you next time", "yc8VgPL-J5Y": "these peanut butter cookies are so easy to make and they are so soft and full of peanut butter flavor if we like soft bakery style peanut butter cookies then you will love these cookies to make these cookies you will need only a few basic ingredients some flour and peanut butter sugar some softened butter one egg at room temperature some vanilla essence or vanilla extract to add a wonderful flavor and aroma to our cookies some baking soda as a leavener and a bit of salt to balance the sweetness so let's see how to make piece of wonderful soft peanut butter cookies in five simple steps so let's start by mixing together all the dry ingredients apart from sugar in a ball so into the flour let's add in the baking soda and [Music] salt and give it a good whisk to make sure everything is evenly distributed in the flour and let's keep it aside [Music] in another bowl add in the butter peanut butter and sugar and let's cream them together [Music] and don't forget to scrape down the sides of

ingredients into this and mix them together and while mixing them together make sure there are no dry patches left behind and now we need to chill our dough we want order to hold its shape while baking so we need our butter in the dough to be firm so that they can hold its shape while baking so keep it in the refrigerator for about 35 to 45 minutes or until the dough is cold so after 45 minutes our dough is ready for shaping so take small portions about one and half tablespoons of dough using a spoon or an ice cream scoop for even measurement and roll them into a bowl and place him on a baking tray lined with the parchment paper or on to a non-stick baking tray and take care to keep your cookies about the same size to help them bake in the same rates in the oven and leave about one and half to two inches space and between the cookie dough as they will spread a little when baked to give that classic look to our peanut butter cookies press the top of the cookie dough with a fork to bring that beautiful crisscross imprints on the top [Music] now our cookie dough is ready to go into the oven so bake it at 350 Fahrenheit for 10 to 12 minutes or until they are golden brown in color [Music] if you want your cookies GU be more crispier you can bake them for a few more minutes if you want to keep the cookie dough for later you can keep them in the fridge for about two to three days or you can freeze the shaped cookie dough in a freezer bag for up to one month these peanut butter cookies are super delicious and if you love the peanut butter flavor and then you will

will go to church after that and a little kids so no moms like me and my sister other kids to church would just be crying it would just be a mess so I just stopped going to church on Mother's Day I was like what the point of this and sit around bullying in my wallow and pity but anyway I was thinking I was like now I'm gonna aah I'm 22 years old I'm not be 23 I can celebrate Mother's Day again like scrub plus I have a grandmother that's kind of unfair to her so today we're making vegan peanut butter cookies because when I was little me and my mom and my sister we would make these peanut butter cookies and forever I thought that she had this special recipe that she knew by heart she made up but no she got up the Betty Crocker cookbook so I just I went back to the bed Crocker cookbook um well I went on the internet and it kind of changed their recipe a little bit so I just kind of went for my hair and try to make it vegan so stay tuned for the recipe so let's birds in a large bowl you want to mix together your white sugar brown sugar even margarine your yogurt your limiter and your peanut butter adding your self-rising flour until it looks like next you want to roll your dough into small balls and place them on a cookie sheet press it down with support like this then at 375 for two minutes so yeah this is how it turned out they're a little bit less formed than I remember me and the bums are really like because I use that parchment paper smart girl oh but yes they used to be like a little bit stiffer like they didn't spread out as much but you're actually supposed to refrigerate the dough and I'll never do that step and I guess it's more important than no since they're vegan um also I could have used more flour but I didn't want them to dry out and that's another step that I kind of skipped buddies as much flour as I couldn't have so here's the taste I guess I'll show you where I figured out that but yes these are my cookies um it's great peanut butter it took

you've got will work and now I'm just gonna go in with the sugar and now I've made this recipe several times but I've only ever used white sugar so if you use another sugar and have success let me know right now we're just gonna go ahead and give the sugar and the peanut butter a stir I probably should have used my hand mixer but it still comes together pretty well with the whisk and now we have our egg I just whisked that ahead of time because it makes it go into the cookie dough a little bit better [Music] and now after about a minute this is the texture of the cookie dough it's very nice it's not too sticky and you could easily add any add-ins right here that you like like chocolate chips so now we're just gonna divide the dough into 12 equal portions and we're gonna roll them out and place them on our parchment paper and right here I'm just going in with the fork to get that classic crisscross design that you see on all chocolate-chip cookies not chocolate chip cookies peanut butter cookies sorry guys now that these are all done we're gonna put these inside of a 350 degree oven and mine took roughly ten minutes [Music] so here they are right out of the oven and we're gonna give these a few minutes to cool and this is what they look like once they've cooled their own and they have a really nice texture and of course a three ingredient recipe you cannot beat that not in these times so here you guys go I love them my kids love them they're really good like I said you could add any kind of add-ins that you have like maybe you have some M&Ms or you have some

Cheers", "gOlL05eZdu8": "Hi guys I'm Caroline and I'm Alejandra. And\ntoday we're making Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies. Nice! They're really simple\nsort of stirred together cookies. They whip Nice! They're really simple\nsort of stirred together cookies. They whip up in a flash. They're great for any occasion.\nSo there's actually a couple different types of sugar in it, we have some brown sugar, white sugar, and we have a little bit of the Smooth Operator peanut butter, which is the best\npart, which makes this peanut butter cookie peanut buttery. We have some vanilla, milk,\nbutter, obviously, and egg, and with a bit of chocolate chips. And we got our flour mixture\nof flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. So let's whip these up! Awesome! So\nwe're going to start with a little bit of softened butter. Could you pass me that peanut\nbutter? Absolutely! We've got about a cup so that's a nice hefty portion. And then I'm going to cream that together with these two sugars. So just until it's nice and fluffy,\nI'm going to give it a little bit of a scrape down and then we're going to add the egg,\nthe vanilla, the milk, couple of turns of the mixer, just until it's incorporated. And\nthe vanilla. And the milk. And now I'll go ahead and add the dry ingredient and add the\nflour mixture gradually. Helps to not make a mess but makes for a really tender cookie.\nI love the smell of butter and peanut butter coming together. It's pretty amazing. So now\nthat it's almost all together, I'm going to add the chocolate chips. Oh I love the smell\nof that vanilla in there. And now we just eat the dough, right? Right! Since these are\ndelicious, big, hunky, peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, we like to use a big cookie\nscoop or you can use an ice cream scoop if you want or just a big spoon. If you want\nto bring over that prepared cookie sheet? Just we're going to toss these down on some\nparchment and I like to bake about four at a time so that they don't expand too much.\nHere we go. So I'm actually just going to toss these in a 350 degree oven for about\n15 minutes and we'll have some delicious cookies. Can't wait. So these are fresh from the oven\nbut we have a plenty still warm ready for us to taste. There you have it! Peanut Butter\nChocolate Chip Cookies. Let's give one a taste! Awesome! This one looks awesome. Crumbly.\nLook, still warm, so delicious. I know you wish you were here right now. I love the melty\nchocolate.

cookies peanut butter cookies i'm gonna make mine instead of using regular sugar i'm gonna use this swerve brown sugar to make them sugar free ready to get started i've got a cup of peanut butter here cup of peanut butter now i'm going to take my swerve brown sugar and get a half a cup so half a cup of this brown sugar okay and then you want one egg okay just want to mix this up good together hope everyone's doing good out there today we're supposed to get a dust in the snow tonight and then tomorrow now i got my cookie sheet i've got my oven preheated to 350 degrees when i made these i i started making these probably about a year and a half ago and i can't remember i'm thinking it takes about 12 minutes for these to bake but today i'm going to use this little bitty scooper so it may not take as long so i'll let you know how long it they bake for so you just start dipping them on your tray and these don't really spread much so you can just put them you can put them pretty close together and then you just want to take a fork and just make like a crisscross since they're wanting to stick i'm going to spray my pork with a little bit of olive oil spray try to keep it from sticking oh yeah that's better okay these are ready to put in the 350 degree preheated oven i'll show you what they look like when they get done okay this has been 12 minutes we like ours pretty brown around the edges but if you don't then maybe 10 minutes might be great for you and one thing i've noticed about these cookies you want them to cool off completely before you try to move them to a cookie platter or anything so i'll bring you back when they cool off and show you what it looks like give a taste test okay now it's taste test time i i didn't count how many i end up getting but there's several at least 24. let's see break it in two see the inside of that can't even tell it don't have flour in it it's awesome um those are good you can't tell it's sugar free either those are good thank you so much for joining me today i hope everyone has a wonderful day and come back [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "wVHm5Tl0Irw": "hey guys it's Danny and today I am sharing my very favorite clean and delicious peanut butter cookies three wait I'm going to be making my sea salt kissed peanut butter cookies my chocolate chip peanut butter cookies and some coconut raisin peanut butter cookies now the beauty of all three of these recipes is that we're going to be using the same base recipe to make all the cookies so we're just going to have a combination of peanut butter egg honey and turbinado sugar now traditionally speaking when somebody makes a three or four ingredient peanut butter cookie just like these they use one cup of white refined sugar - 1 cup of peanut butter but we are going to be pulling that way back as a matter of fact I'm cutting it in half we're just going to be using a quarter cup of honey and a quarter cup of turbinado sugar and the combination of these two sweeteners makes for a very moist delicious cookie and because that turbinado sugar has slightly bigger granules it also adds a nice little crunchy texture to the cake so the base recipe I'm going to be using looks like this 1 cup of unsalted creamy peanut butter into my bowl now guys when you're buying your peanut butter you want to buy an all-natural peanut butter and when you open it you will notice that there is oil that pulls at the top of it for these cookies what I like to do is pour that oil off and then make sure to get all the peanut butter a really good stir and then measure it out next up I have 1 egg then a quarter cup of honey and a quarter cup of turbinado sugar I'm just going to mix this until all the ingredients are well combined and then onto a rimmed baking sheet that I have lined with a Silpat mat I'm going to drop these 1 heaping tablespoon at a time then once I've got all my cookies on the baking sheet and I usually get 15 cookies per recipe I go back with a fork and create that traditional crisscross mark that you see on top of peanut butter cookies so you're just going to gently push down in one direction with your fork and then back in the opposite direction then I have this a beautiful flaky sea salt the brand I'm using today is called Mountain sea salt you can see they're very big salt crystals so you just need a little pinch on top of each cookie to give it that little finishing salty flavor so I just put a small pinch on each cookie just like that and then these are ready to go into a 350 degree oven for 12 minutes or until they are cooked through and lightly browned then for my chocolate chip peanut butter cookies a personal favorite I've got that same base recipe all mixed together in my bowl and I'm simply adding in a half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips then you're just going to mix this until the chips are worked all through the dough and same thing drop them on to your room to baking sheet that is liner the Silpat mat into little mounds and then go back to the top and make the crisscross marks same deal for cooking into the 350 degree oven for 12 minutes until cooked through and lightly browned and then finally our third variation of the clean and delicious peanut butter cookie is coconut and raisins so into my bowl I have that same base recipe all mixed together and ready to go and I am going to add in a quarter cup of shredded coconut and a quarter cup of raisins and then just gently mix this until all of those ingredients are mixed into the batter and this one I feel like has a little extra holiday Flair because the coconut reminds me of snow now I'm just going to drop them right onto my baking sheet and then back over for the crisscross 350 degrees for 12 minutes and look at these beautiful cookies would you please look at all of these yummy peanut butter cookies they are nice and soft they're moist in the middle they have that little crunch from the turbinado sugar and the chocolate chip one that I've got right here those chips just melt in your mouth guys give me a big thumbs up if you enjoy peanut butter cookies as much as I do and then come on down to the comments below and let me know which one you think you're going to track if you haven't already please subscribe and thank you so much for watching I'm Danny speeds off see you back here next time

tastes here we go ready one", "mXk12FnHnss": "[Music] hi I'm chef Raphael and welcome to baking with Chef profit I show that's meant to make you that baking is not so complicated today I'm going to show you how to make peanut butter cookies for the ingredients we have all-purpose flour we have sugar we have the peanut butter some bicarbonate of soda that's what is used as a raising agent one egg and some margarine I'm going to measure 170 grams whenever you're using butter make sure that is at room temperature that's something worth noting and then I always love saying this point where by that you need to measure ingredients so always that's why I have a weighing scale invest in a weighing scale and it will make your work easier and then to this and adds by egg then the peanut butter you can use smooth peanut butter or you can use the one that is crunchy with the nuts inside so whichever you prefer now to this I will add the flour all-purpose flour and the bicarbonate of soda and then I will fold our gently fold the fly into them into the mixture so the idea right now is to make sure that all the flour is fully mixed and the moment you see all the flat you don't see any traces of flour that's when the mixture is ready it's a little bit too soft for working with so what you should do is put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes so that it becomes slightly hard to work with because right now what we need to do is to make balls but it's too soft to work with so it's now been about 30 minutes in the fridge remember you had a lot of margarine or butter it's soft we have been at butter it's also soft so it makes this mixture to be extra soft so when you put it in the fridge what it does it makes it slightly harder because we want to sharp shape it into small balls like that and then you place it on your baking tin baking tray now with a baking tray you see I put a grease proof paper it helps in cooking the cookies so that they don't stick on the tray and all we need to do is to make them into equal sized balls and make them the same size and then space them on your baking tin depending on your size of team now you have to space them because you need to give them space but the other thing that we will do now that you you have our balls is to flatten the cookies using a fork now what we are also going to do is to dip our fork in sugar and then you press it like that [Music] and then you cross it to press on the other side and then what you have is a cross shape design so the sugar will help in making it not stick but it also gives a nice finish when it's been fully picked so press on one side some sugar and then press on the other side now the sugar part is optional just make sure that when you're pressing it we try and make it as even as possible on all the edges and then don't press too much just leave it as it is it's it's about a centimeter thick so now it should go into the oven the oven is already hot it's at 180 degrees and it will cook for about 10 minutes you know it's cooked when on the sides on the edges it starts turning brown so what will happen when you turn them to be in a golden brown or slightly lighter than this so this should be the darkest you should get but you know that they're cooked went on the side they are proud and then don't be fooled by it when you press them they actually tend to be soft like this one is freshly still warm from the oven so it's soft on the inside so you can easily press it but what happens is that when they cool down they become had and cookie like so as they break now it's actually hard so this is the characteristics for most cookie recipes I'm chef Raphael signing out and by the way make sure you subscribe to my youtube channel I'm also on Facebook Instagram and

Eva whatcha want whatcha want whatcha want whatcha want sugary what me Oh Betty what me [Music]", "ycy3BBPR3XA": "if you're allergic to nuts you're not gonna like this recipe all right y'all so today we're gonna be making some peanut butter cookies one of my favorites this is the same recipe i use for my cookie business i'm giving it to y'all because you can't take it with you when you leave you know what i'm saying and ain't nothing like having a good recipe on standby when you need it if you like peanut butter cookies this is gonna be a jam all right so we got seven ounces of brown sugar and seven ounces of white sugar uh they both convert to one cup a piece so if you're using uh measuring cups you can go that route but if you can i suggest that you get a scale because uh it makes a lot easier when you uh doubling up on your recipe and whatnot so what we're gonna do is we're gonna mix these two sugars together right quick all right that's good just want to break up those chunks of brown sugar next we're going to add in some room temperature butter [Music] mix all this together with a spoon i got a stand mixer but i'm gonna do this by hand just in case you know some of y'all don't have a stand mixer you know what i'm saying it's gonna take a little bit more elbow grease to do it by hand but still comes together rather quickly as long as everything is room temp that's the important thing make sure the butter not cold you know set it out the night before on the countertop [Music] and you should be good you just gonna mix this together until everything combines and it's a smooth consistency okay so you pretty much pretty much want to get it to this consistency right here see how it kind of light up a little bit it's kind of fluffy that's where you want it to be it all right it's pretty standard for any cookie dough uh use two eggs if you're doing a fuel recipe what you're going to do is you want to add them one at a time once the first one is almost fully incorporated you go ahead and add you want to make sure your eggs are room temperature too because if your butter is room temperature and your eggs are ice cold guess what's gonna happen to the butter it's gonna start turning back solid and the mixture is not gonna combine correctly just make sure all your cold ingredients see how that mixed in real quick now i'm going to switch back to my rubber spatula because it's going to kind of give me that same kind of action as the paddle would on the stand mixer so whip it up a little bit now we're going to add the uh secret ingredient one of them grandmama secrets you know what i'm saying or no professional baker secrets whenever you have a fresh homemade cookie you know i'm saying one from a bakery you know you're looking for something that's going to be like soft and chewy and whatnot and you need something that's going to contain that moisture in the product and one good thing to use is molasses [Music] glass is going to give you that soft chewy texture as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extract usually uh pure vanilla extract i'm using that imitation stuff man that ain't it yeah you know kind of light a lot of times when you're making cookie dough the mixture will look curdled you know from the eggs that mean you need to keep on mixing usually when everything is room temp man it only take like 20 30 seconds for it to come together about right there that's where you want to be and we only got one more step left to do and the cookie dough is done all right y'all so right here we have 12 ounces of all-purpose flour it's equivalent to about a cup and a half we're gonna add a teaspoon of baking soda and two teaspoons of salt generally when you bake in the batch of cookies it costs for like one teaspoon of salt but i like to put two because to me as i've gotten older like salt is so much more important in the dessert you know what i mean because sunshine stuff can just be too sweet so i like to uh double up on the salt and trust me when you travel like okay i see see what you talking about so let's gonna whisk this together any lumps that's in the flour out and [Music] combine it with the peanut butter man sure oh yeah and you know while you're dealing with your dry ingredients um wet ingredients might need to be mixed up a little bit more you know so you can emulsify again so just give it a quick little whip up [Applause] until it's not looking curdled you know if that's the case then go ahead and add the dry ingredients and then just mix it until it forms a cookie dough yeah don't over mix that that's the that's the that's the number one rule when you know you're making cookies or cakes you know stuff like that it's like supposed to be like a tender product you don't want to over mix it just mix it until it combines and then stop because you're gonna be mad man trust me a lot of flowers like halfway mixed in let's keep on going see you don't see no more white see how easy that was really if i wasn't filming this i would already be like probably been scooping it by now that's how fast y'all gonna be done with it okay so for a little bit of mixing that's what you're looking for consistency wise for the cookie dough light and fluffy soft supple [Music] portion scoop mashed potato scoop whatever you got you know okay you know just try to get them evenly portioned out and uh put them on a baking sheet lined with some some parchment paper a wax paper or something we're gonna do it after we get them all scooped up we're wrap them up and put them in the fridge or the freezer so you can have your individual portions and then whenever you're ready to bake them you can just pull out however many you want and go to town cause ain't nobody gonna eat all these cookies you know at one time unless you have a party or something it's a good way to have some cookies on standby you know going to have some sweet after dinner you know what i'm saying you want to have a little little snack for your kids you know to take to school after school snack tell y'all a quick little story about how you know i had my first peanut butter cookie i was like six years old me and my mom and my brother and my auntie we moved along the beach we got some people out there we got there for a couple of years and uh first year we was out there i walked up in the kitchen and my auntie had two cereal bowls on the counter and she was whipping up cookie dough in a cereal bowl oatmeal raising the peanut butter i don't even remember her middle name she was just throwing stuff in the bowl and mixing it up with a little silverware spoon and uh man when i take him with the best cookies i've ever had in my life it was like uh like a ratatouille when the uh food critic came up in there he ate the ratatouille and he was like yo that's how it was but i tried to make the damn cookies after she left because they left us behind so they can go find jobs they move back to houston i tried to make cookies in the microwave i didn't even know what the hell she put in the bowl but i took sugar and chunky peanut butter mixed it up and put it in the microwave on the plate that sizzled for for a couple minutes i tried to keep it enough so it could turn into a cookie it didn't work i still ate it though i think i got my  for that i can't remember all right now that we got them all portioned out we're going to wrap them up like i said and pop them in the fridge or the freezer you can do it for like two or three hours you know if you want to bake them the same day but it's best if you do it at least overnight you know and um yeah so we're just gonna wrap them up and uh i'm gonna be back tomorrow all right y'all so it's the next day after they chill for a little bit and they solidified you can go ahead and remove them from the sheet pan and uh put them inside of a ziploc bag freezer bag or you know a little storage bag and then keep them in the freezer like that then whenever you want you can just take out how many you want to bake them all right so i'm going to take out a dozen of these cookies put them on the sheet pan and we're going to bake them off in a 350 degree oven for about 12 to 15 minutes all right so we got them panned up they're about two to three inches apart you know what i'm saying you want to give them each enough space so they'll be able to spread out without touching them spreading to each other that's going to be an ugly mess man [Music] all right y'all so here's the finished product after about 15 minutes baking at 350 we've been cooling down for about five minutes now really want to let them cool down for at least like 10 minutes um but make sure you slightly under bake them you know what i mean because you want them to still be soft and have that uh chewy exterior and whatnot put me up with glass ice cold milk you dig all right so there it is peanut butter cookies from scratch if you want to you can add some chocolate chips to them you can stuff them with reese's peanut butter cups or whatever you want just don't add no raisins to them", "ee9_yg4vVro": "[Music] [Applause] new butter peanut butter [Music] [Applause] [Applause]

take a look at these homemade peanut butter cookies they're fantastic and easy to make you start with 1/3 cup of sugar and then you want to add well peanut butter of course half a cup your favorite peanut butter crunchy or smooth and then to that you just add one egg and then stir it all together get that egg blend it in just do it by hand I'm just gonna use a spoon it's not hard at all these are some of the easiest cookies you'll ever make man I really like peanut butter cookies how about you once you get that all stirred together we're gonna add some flour 1/8 to 1/4 cup of self-rising flours what I'm using you know if you don't have self-rising flour just add a little bit of baking powder to regular flour and it works the same so I'm gonna add the rest of that or almost the rest of that quarter cup of self-rising flour and work that in just nice and easy stir it together I'm gonna speed this up but I want you to see how it's done and how easy it really is and it should come together and form kind of a thick paste about like this see how thick it is but it's still very moist then I'm gonna get a little ice cream scooper to help them with the size pull them out and roll them up just like you who are playing with play-doh make little balls just scoop them out it's easy and once you get them all rolled up this is a small batch and I tell you what these are so good you'll probably want to double this batch then you have to put the traditional mark and you get a fork and you do the crisscross pattern just gently press it in just like that and if you like your cookies more crisp than you'll want to flatten them more but I like mine nice and soft and chewy so into the oven the preheated 350-degree oven and cook them for 15 to 17 minutes these stayed in exactly 15 minutes and this is how they turn out beautiful just the way I like them I like mine really soft a little crisp around the edges but then soft in the middle take a look at that mmm not bad huh let's break one open and get a look inside oh that's just a beautiful cookie and it's nice and soft chewy inside completely done lightly crisp around the outside edges bottoms nice and lightly browned just the way you want them just a really good cookie overall once again if you like peanut butter cookies I think you'll like these and you can customize them to your own tastes these have just the right amount of sweetness and peanut butter but you can alter it it adjust the ratios too to your own palate what tastes good to you but these are excellent and easy to make I hope you give them a try hey thanks for watching take care we'll see you next time bye now [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "l3ZM60EA52M": "[Music] audio [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] so

not getting here any minute that's right the peanut butter family is growing I am going to be painting their mom today out of this beautiful beautiful Barbie so I picked her for several reasons number one I love her absolutely gorgeous gorgeous hair she's got beautiful freckles that I think would match her son perfectly and because I accidentally bought two of her so I had a double so now her hair is already similar to the lol see how they kind of have their hair pulled back so I love that she's got like this little itty-bitty mini pullback here so I love the way her hair is but we definitely need to make her match her family a little bit more so step number one all three of her kids have black eyebrows so I'm going to take my black paint and dip in my toothpick right in there here he carefully now paint her eyebrows which she has these really beautiful eyebrows just go in and paint them right there's one eyebrow now the other one yes perfect her eyebrows look amazing now also her three kids all have brown eyes so I'm going with this brown which is my favorite Brown to use guys it's called chocolate bar I love that so much so I actually feel like I'm painting with chocolate oh that would be so amazing so again with my toothpick you know I had to be really careful painting her eyes because they are small it is not like painting it with lol so very very carefully I am going to paint right inside oh she's looking so different already [Music] okay that seriously changed up her look like instantly look at that she looks like a totally different Barbie all right now her little itty-bitty baby I believe I have painted her mouth with the pink eraser color so that's exactly what I have here so might as well just kind of keep some of the colors same so I'm just gonna paint her lipstick in this pink eraser color might as well I could also paint it a brown to kind of match the other two lol but I like her lips pink I think they're kind of pretty so we are going to just change up that color why not all right her face is done now we are going to work on her outfit so even though this dress is really pretty I want her to fit in with the rest of her peanut butter family so they are wearing a lot of creams and like a peanut butter nutty color and like a darker brown so we need to add those colors and do her outfit as well so she's wearing this really cool t-shirt dress so I'm gonna be painting on here but first I'm going to prep her dress by just using some Mod Podge I should be using some fabric paint but I just want to use the acrylic paint that I did on the other lol just to keep the colors the same so whenever I paint her dress with acrylic paint it could get really really stiff and cracked so to prevent that I'm gonna use a little bit of some Mod Podge to kind of help seal her dress and keep it a little bit flexible but I do not plan on changing her outfit so I think it's okay that I'm just gonna be painting right over I think that's not gonna create any problem at all but of course I really should be using fabric paint if I want to make her dress really flexible and easier to take on and off she's gonna be wearing this dress forever because this can be her custom peanut butter dress might as well just paint this Mod Podge on and kind of get it primed and ready for the acrylic paint [Music] all right now her dress is nice and covered in Mod Podge now we're just gonna continue on with the color so we can really do anything with her t-shirt dress but I really like how her son has all of these little peanuts on his hoodie and these bows also kind of heard the same color as the peanuts so we're gonna paint her dress this creamy white bread color it reminds me of the inside of the bread right this kind of white bread here so for that I use this toasted marshmallow color Oh another acrylic name that I absolutely love and yep just start painting you know I don't know if I could have found this toasted marshmallow color in fabric paint but that's okay that's why I'm just gonna use the acrylic paint hopefully the paint does not crack all right that was the first coat and it looks like it's nice and dry but super duper splotchy splotchy yep uh-huh I'm just gonna go in with a second coat oh no her hair here we go do not want to paint her hair into her dress after that second coat it looks like it could still use a third coat now I'm gonna go in it with like this rich peanut buttery color always call it that because that's what it looks like peanut butter and right at the bottom of her dress I'm just going to fill in the seam and just paint it this color [Music] and I'm gonna go in with that color too and I'm just gonna paint it on the sleeves oh I painted a little bit on her dress no go away whoopsie no one knows and I'm also going to paint the collar as well in this brown color all right her dress is all painted now I'm going it to put a little print on the front here I'm gonna paint on some bows and just like pbbb has on her dress you see that that she's got these like little tiny bows going all the way down how many does she have she has one two three four five six seven so pbbt has seven so let's start just painting them on the mom and see how many we should paint yeah I'm just gonna paint with my toothpick you guys know how I do it I love painting with toothpicks so I'm gonna paint a little bow right here on the top I'm gonna make them a little bit larger than what pbbb has just a tiny touch may be too thick isn't the easiest way to paint it okay let me try on a smaller paintbrush so now I'm gonna paint the next bow so go down a little bit put a little dot for the middle then now paint my bow oh there we go okay that one was much easier than painting with the toothpick go back and kind of fix this bow up a little bit there's no wrong way to do it okay so one two oh she looks so cute like that with just two little bows guys she looks so cute I love or her dress it looks adorable all right now we have to paint her shoes so we've got dark brown and we've got that cream color again to paint the shoes Phoebe baby actually has three colors cuz I also painted the lace of her little shoes there on the top a lighter brown so take her shoes off and just paint her shoes all brown and once that first coat dries now I'm going to go in with second coat now I'm going to use this peanut buttery color right on my toothpick we're just gonna add some details to her shoelaces [Music] then I can go in with that toasted marshmallow color and now paint the bottom of the shoe oh this is really making it all come together now [Music] alrighty right now once these are all dry take a little bit of some Mod Podge water it down with water and now I'm just going to paint over the shoes and this is going to create a sealer on top of it and seal in all of the paint and I'm gonna do the same thing to her face everywhere I painted with acrylic paint I'm just gonna go over it with the Mod Podge and just seal it all in so her eyes and her eyebrows and now I'm gonna take that Mod Podge and yep I'm going to paint it right on over her dress because I want to prevent as much cracking from this paint as possible because it probably will crack over time since it's not fabric paint but at least I can try to prevent it from doing too much damage by painting it with the Mod Podge and just sealing it all in but of course I could have just used some fabric paint or some textile fabric medium but sometimes you just gotta use what you got right I didn't have any of that so I'm just doing it this way oh mom is here where's mom at so here's oh come here sweetie Oh bribe the peanut butter mama is hearing me this is her with her family you guys this craft was so fun so easy to convert this Barbie into the peanut butter family with the rest of the lol it's so so so cute I think she fits in just absolutely perfectly I love her dress and her shoes everything I think she really was the perfect fit Oh even happier mom is here I love how the three girls have their little bows on their outfits my dad wears a shirt just like mine oh wait a minute would you guys also like to see the peanut butter dad that goes along with this family hey that sounds like that would be a super duper fun craft too I hope you guys like this video remember to follow me on Instagram that's where I've been showing all of my sneak peeks and behind-the-scenes footage so see you on Instagram and I'll see you in my next video vodka Japan's [Music]", "4KSHiieyVBo": "today I'm going to teach you how to make the best peanut butter cookies ever and even better it's easy you probably have all the ingredients in your kitchen already I just know you're going to make them over and over again in a good-quality mixer and you know I only use the KitchenAid cream together the butter and the sugars until fluffy this takes about three minutes in the mixer I usually stop the mixer and brush down the sides so that all the sugar and butter can fully blended together next add the eggs the peanut butter and the vanilla extract slowly add the flour and the baking soda and mix it well that's it the batter is done now we just need to cook them line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or use a Silpat mat that's what I like to use drop the dough by the tablespoon onto the prepared cookie sheets make sure to make the checkered Fork marks in your cookies it's kind of retro but it makes them classic bake them for 15 minutes or until brown on the edges and don't over bake them you want these cookies to be crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside cool them for about 2 minutes before you move them to a wire cooling rack have fun with these cookies add chopped peanuts or chocolate chips or crumble them on ice cream or even try dipping them in extra chocolate these peanut butter cookies are the best ever I know you're going to love them they're soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside I know you won't have any left over let me know how they work for you and I'll see you next time", "j6XQPQEGKfA": "everybody I will Alexis and today I'm going to be doing and to recipes of P butter cookies one recipe is going to be a three ingredient recipe for peanut butter cookies and then the other one is going to be five ingredients so you know that sounds pretty familiar and that is because we've seen it everywhere it's been all over tik-tok these peanut butter chocolate chip cookie five ingredient cookies and I I'm dying to figure out how they taste so today we're going to be doing this three ingredient and the five this is going to be my attempt peanut butter cookies so if you want to see how these two recipes turned out then keep on watching so for the ingredients this is everything that you will need you will need a cup of peanut butter a cup of sugar egg half a cup of chocolate chips and these are milk chocolate if you prefer semi-sweet or dark chocolate you can go ahead and do that I do prefer semi-sweet but this is what I had on hand one large egg and one teaspoon of baking soda we are going to add all our ingredients to a large mixing bowl we're going to add the cup of peanut butter next we're adding a cup of sugar one teaspoon of baking soda our large egg and our chocolate chips then we are just going to be mixing everything up now that our batter it's ready to go we set our oven at 350 and we are going to go to the next step okay so now that we have our oven preheated we got a baking sheet and lined it with parchment paper and now we're just going to we're going to roll the batter into 12 equal balls [Music] okay guys so your next step is after you have your 12 cookies laid out on your parchment you're going to be putting it into the 350 degree oven for 8 to 10 minutes Siri can you turn on a timer for 8 minutes okay your timer is set for 8 minutes okay so now that I have my timer set I'm gonna wait the minutes and then if he needs a little bit more time I'm gonna leave it on for the full time [Music] okay guys so I ended up putting them in for the full ten minutes and they look so good I'm gonna let them cool for at least another ten minutes you always want to make sure that they cool so I'm gonna put the I'm gonna go set these aside and we will get started on our other recipe okay you guys so for this next recipe that is the three ingredient peanut butter cookies we are going to need a cup of peanut butter a cup of sugar and one egg we are gonna add our peanut butter our sugar and our egg okay you guys so now I have a nother pan with some parchment paper or some parchment paper laid across and I'm going to take a little bit of the dough and make a ball about this big and I'm going to keep doing that until my pan is full [Music] [Music] we're gonna take a fork and we're going to press into the cookies this is just going to give it that old school canned butter cookie look so now that we have them all pressed out we're going to put them in a 350 degree oven for 12 to 14 minutes again I'm gonna put it on for 12 and then if it looks like it needs a little bit more time we'll leave it on for the full 14 okay 12 minutes of counting our three ingredient cookies chefs came out of the oven I left him on for the full 14 minutes because I felt like they needed it they got way bigger than I thought so I'm gonna let his cool for 10 minutes just like I did the other ones and then I will come back and try them both without me i I just realized I have a big enough difference to create one phenomena accidentally instead of the first recipe when he added the white sugar to five I think you perceive it wasn't supposed to be white sugar it supposed to be brown sugar so I mean I'm told me to compare but the keys and see which one would do more with it but I don't know if it's going to affect like the cake you guys I'm thinking okay you guys so we are finally done with both of our cookies this is our five ingredient tick tock cookie and this is our three ingredient now like I said the five ingredient accidentally messed up I put white sugar but instead of brown but I don't think it should matter too much but they look so good [Music] I'm gonna break them in half so you guys can see what they look like oh so they look super soft in the inside I'm going to go ahead and try the five ingredient tick tock cookie first yeah oh really go misses are very ingredient this one that seems to be like a little bit more of a harder cookie the other one was more soft but let's try it I don't know which one I like more this one is more traditional to what my family makes the three ingredient just because there's no chocolate chips and it's more of a harder cookie but the other cookie is really soft and it has like it's kind of chewy so it kind of just depends on what you like I think they're good I don't know what the brown sugar would have done that for the five ingredient cookie but I actually like it the way it is and to be totally honest I was running out of brown sugar anyways so this worked out for me well I gotta go guys I had a bunch of dishes to clean up whole kitchen to clean up link the two recipes in the description box below so you guys can try it out hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if you got this far I mean it's the end of the video you might as well just subscribe that's

showing you how to make my delicious homemade peanut butter cookies from scratch quick history these cookies were created by the late George Washington Carver he was an African American agriculture scientist and inventor he invented three recipes that call for peanut cookies an account for the peanuts to either be crushed or chopped in a day at time the 1920s came around peanut butter was invented they added it into the cookies and it became known today as peanut butter cookies this recipe calls for about 20 cookies not only are these cookies chewy moist and full of peanut butter flavors but they are absolutely delicious so without further adieu let's get started here is all that you will need to make your homemade peanut butter cookies let's get some when I read you will need some all-purpose flour baking powder baking soda salt sugar brown sugar unsalted butter at room temperature butter flavour vegetable shortening at room temperature and now if you don't have this you can use the regular flavor as well one large egg at room temperature one hundred percent pure vanilla extract and 16 ounces of creamy peanut butter to bake your peanut butter cookies you will need some parchment paper and an 11 by 17 inch baking pan and there you have it let's get straight to it add 1 and 2/3 cups of all-purpose flour 1/2 a teaspoon of baking powder 1/2 a teaspoon of baking soda and 1/8 teaspoon of salt give this a quick stir in our stand mixer with the paddle attachment add one stick of unsalted butter at room temperature three tablespoons of vegetable shortening at room temperature 2/3 cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of brown sugar start your mixer on a medium low speed just to get that butter shortening and sugar incorporated and turn the mix up to the highest setting mix this on high speed for 4 minutes not at some point don't knows 4 minutes stop your mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl continue mixing that end scrape down the sides of your bowl add one large egg at room temperature and two teaspoons of vanilla extract mix on a medium speed until combined [Applause] scrape down the sides of your bowls add 3/4 cup of peanut butter and your all-purpose flour mixture add it in there all at once mix on a Wien low speed until combined scrape down the sides of your bowl and our peanut butter cookie batter is now ready that will be dipped not worried is normal place this into your refrigerator or freezer for 30 minutes butter the bottom of your baking pan now this is the butter is added so that way your parchment paper when you add that on top it will stick to the bottom of the pan okay so you're gonna lie on the bottom of your pan with parchment paper and create your oven to 325 degrees here I have an ice cream scoop we're gonna take a medium sized amount of our peanut butter cookie batter and place it into the palm of our hands now you're going to roll it into a ball and once done you're gonna place it onto your baking pan using your fingers press down onto each individual ball of cookie dough this will ensure even baking now for the fun part here I have a fork we're gonna take the fork and we're going to make some indentations on top of each piece of cookie dough now you don't have to follow this step if you don't want to yes for me I like the fork design it's pretty nice it is the best way you can now the cookies are ready to be baked quick tip if you want to make these cookies another day you can take them and place them into the freezer now for longer storage once the cookies are frozen you can take them place them into a freezer bag or one little vacuum sealer bag and they can be placed into the freezer for about one to three months okay place into a preheated 325 degree oven bake for 20 minutes remove your peanut butter cookies out of the oven after baking on 325 degrees for 20 minutes let the cookies cool completely before serving for best results serve these the very next day so that way the flavors can settle and increase overnight they can also be stored at room temperature in an airtight container or bag for about seven days here is the final presentation and there you have it homemade peanut

welcome to Crocs in the kitchen I'm Jessica and Brian's not here but don't worry he'll be back later to help me with the taste test portion of the video so today's recipe was actually inspired by my love for baking so before we switched eating a whole food plant-based diet I really loved to bake I baked especially around the holidays I made a ton of cookies and shared them with everybody and it was really fun unfortunately it also was probably one of the reasons why I weighed 285 pounds um so when we switched to eating this way baking wasn't necessarily my number one priority to figure out because I knew I would even if I made healthy things I'd still overeat on them but this season I feel like I'm more comfortable I've got a year and a half fish almost under my belt of eating this way and so I decided I would just start experimenting with different cookie recipes so my original idea was you know those peanut blossoms it's like the Hershey recipe with the Hershey Kisses and the peanut butter cookie and it's all covered in sugar and it's delicious so my original inspiration was that cookie now what I discovered I tried a few different variations and the first one I made ended up being like really really dense it was like a dense peanut butter cookie with chocolate on top which was fine but it's not that like flaky fluffy peanut blossom that you get if you make the real thing so I kind of decided to take this in a totally different direction and I really liked the idea of sweetening it with just dates my previous version had some maple syrup in there but I really loved the flavor of the dates and so it kind of ended up being more of a chewy bite thing than an actual cookie per se so I'm gonna call these my chocolate peanut butter cookie in quotes bites and basically it's like chewy it's got peanut butter it's got flour it's got chocolate and it's just good the first version I made I would eat them and I would be like okay these are good but I didn't want to eat the whole entire tray of them which is probably a good thing in hindsight these ones when I eat one I want to eat the whole tray and so that's when I knew that I had a decent recipe to share with you guys so I think the first thing we're gonna do is go through all of the ingredients that you'll need which as I said are very simple so let's show you so the first ingredient you'll need are some medjool dates obviously you want to make sure you pit these I use the ones from Aldi because they're really affordable and they're really good quality I used 160 grams which ended up being about 9 large ones for me up next you're going to need some vanilla almond milk a quarter cup of that I actually make it super vanilla by adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to it as well and then your flour is going to be oat flour now I like to make my own so I have one and a half cups of rolled oats just the old-fashioned kind and I'm going to put them in my Vitamix and make them into flour you could also just start with pre-purchased oat flour if you want to go that route then you'll need a half teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 a cup of peanut butter I have homemade peanut butter and you can see it gets really creamy and delicious looking Bryan actually prefers this over just like any kind of store-bought peanut butter but basically all I did was take just peanuts that are what are they they are roasted but unsalted peanuts and I just took those and literally blitzed it up in my Vitamix now it did take about 2 or 3 minutes of processing and you do really have to go in with a tamper so it can be a bit of a mess but I really like making my own but if you don't want to make your own just find the least amount of ingredients you don't want anything really added you don't want to add sugar or any of that kind of stuff you really just need peanuts that's all you need just blitzed up peanuts last but not least is my favorite part which is the chocolate so I like to use these Lilly's chocolate bars they have an extremely dark chocolate which is 85 percent cocoa and they have a 70 Cocco extra dark for this recipe I like to use the extra dark when I'm just snacking on chocolate which I never do obviously I eat the 85 percent cocoa one but for this I think the seventy goes really well with it and it's not as a little it's a little bit less bitter I guess you could say um this chocolate is vegan and it's sweetened with stevia now this recipe is not sponsored in any sort of way by Lily's I'm just sharing with you my favorite product as far as chocolate goes on the vegan side and it's got no sugar added just the stevia and it's really delicious so I'm gonna use the chocolate in three different ways so I have the little it cut into the little rectangles that it's already scored into and then I also have it melted PF I mean another spoon I haven't melted look at that I just want to eat that right now and then I have finally cut into just little squares so these are like my little chocolate chunks so I'm gonna use it in a few different ways you have some options with this recipe of how you want to put it all together at the end but yeah I think we've done enough chatting about it and the ingredients and everything so let's show you how to put it all together alright so up first am i talking really loud I can't tell up first you're going to make your oat flour so of course I'm gonna use my Vitamix which is why I'm wearing my giant headphones for ear protection and I'm gonna take one and a half cups of old-fashioned and rolled oats and put them into my ride a mix well alright so you're going to basically just turn it on you that's basically it you just need a few seconds let's see here hmm oh right so this is my oat flour it's just ground up oats so I'm gonna put this into my bowl oh I guess I can take my headphones off so I can judge how loudly I'm talking oh wow the world sounds the world sounds so much different with my headphones on it's like just totally different okay so before we do the next thing let's um do this thing so we have our baking powder and we're going to measure out a half a teaspoon of that and add that in yeah I don't know if this stuff is really necessary but I always loved the fact that when you baked you're supposed to take all the dry ingredients and whisk them together cuz it just seems fun so that's what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna whisk it it just seems so nice and I don't know I just like it whiskey whiskey whisk I'm gonna bring in my next tool which is my food processor all right what's holy man okay so the food processor is going to help us get those dates into something that will not be chunky I don't know I think it's a date paste kind of thing is what it ends up being but we are going to open this put the dates in here now these dates I keep my dates frozen so I just I throw them directly in the freezer and I just put these after I pitted them and wash them and everything I just put them in the microwave for about 15 seconds just to soften them up just a slight bit and they are ready to go and they've also actually been sitting out for like an hour after that while we prepared and prepped and filmed the intro 85 times and all that kind of stuff so I'm going to add these to the food processor okay now I'm going to blitz these up so you just turn it on and basically you're looking for it to kind of form into this giant ball of like date paste just a giant sticky date thing very official [Music] [Music] so once it kind of all starts to just stick together you can see so you can see it just kind of sticks together as this like ball and date goodness that's when you know that it's all ready so now we are going to add the almond milk which if you remember I added the vanilla to it so it's like super vanilla almond milk so we're gonna add that in here sorry I'm showing you the back of the bowl instead of my pour I'm not super graceful at this yet I'll get there one day um okay is that all you need to add yes okay so we add that and then we're gonna process it some more and that's just gonna kind of just a few seconds that's just gonna kind of loosen it up a bit so I like to add that you know how they always say like slowly add the dry mix you know and all that stuff so keeping with that I like to add about half of it in here and then I'm going to process it again are you sensing a trend here [Music] you're just looking for it to start getting incorporated so then we're gonna add the remaining oat flour baking powder mixture come on do it so then you're just going to blend it again and basically like I said you're just looking for everything to be incorporated [Music] this would probably be a good time to just kind of scrape down the sides a little bit it's kind of you can see it's forming into like this giant massive ball now but just kind of make sure you're getting everything you're not missing out on any of your ingredients [Music] okay so this is the point where it has sort of started like base forming into a ball again of like just everything's kind of sticking together so I'm going to put this into my bowl and this there's gonna be probably one mean like clump and then you're gonna have to kind of scrape out the rest of it a little bit so we're getting down to the final ingredients here so we got it in our Bowl right so this is what it looks like you can see it's pretty thick pretty sticky but not too bad now we're going to add the peanut butter alright so yeah all the peanut butter in there now my next tool which by the way this would be a good moment to say that if you're ever curious about any of the products we use in our videos we do have a new Amazon page where we have a list of all our favorite products now the thing about that page is if you click on that link and use that page we do get a small like commission on any sales that go through that link and I'm totally cool with if you just want to search Amazon for these products and not go through our link that's totally cool we use any proceeds that we get it doesn't cost anything extra to you if you do that and we get you use any of the proceeds that we get to buy stuff to make our channel better and continue making videos and all that stuff so check the link in the description below for the Amazon list and it has a lot of the other stuff that we use on our channel as well but I will try to find this this actually my mom gave me this and I like I wanted to use this I have a fancy stand mixer but I wanted to use this because this reminds me of baking cookies with my mom as a child because she although hers was like olive green colored her original one like all the appliances used to be and but she gave me this and I do like using it from time to time I'm going to plug it in oh this reminds me of the time there was one time I was making cupcakes and my hair was like really long and I got my hair in the liked mixer and in the cupcake batter and it was not a pretty sight like yeah anyway alright so we're going to beat this start out a little bit slow and then increase your speed to high so we're just going to get it all incorporated so you can see it's kind of crumbly now like it's not necessarily coming together it's pretty dry so what I did was I added at this point if you notice that you need more liquid and it might be a little bit more liquidy or less if just depending on your consistency of your peanut butter and all kinds of other factors so who knows but basically I'm going to take a tablespoon of the almond milk that I used earlier and add it in there at this point and then I will re beat this just put it on low again [Music] the other good part about using a hand mixer is that you could always like lick the these I mean who didn't do that when they made like brownies or whatever as a kid mm-hm and the good thing about making this kind of recipe is all this stuff can be eaten raw anyway so you can eat as much as the dough as you want alright Matt Matt okay so this is it we could probably add a little bit more milk if we wanted but I'm actually good with how that is I'm gonna go with it it's kind of sticking together looks like it will form into nice little balls so let's reset the stage we'll be right back and we're back so my husband Brian just pointed out that my assistant for god\u00b4s have preheat the oven so we're gonna go ahead and put that on 375 now it's time to roll these into balls so I like to do about one inch is what I prefer so you're just gonna kind of form it and then roll it and a little bit more it should make about 24 sometimes my only does 22 just depends on how big you make them or how much dough you accidentally eat while you're testing it maybe [Music] [Music] so after you'd roll them into balls you can go ahead and just start baking them or you can get a little fancy if you want so what I've done is I've broken some of my chocolate bars like I showed you earlier into these little squares and I'm gonna take half of these which I only ended up with 20 it just depends how big you make them this is kind of the size I like to do but I'm gonna take half of them and stuff them so I'm just gonna take this put it in here and then close it up again and then re-roll it close and so then half of them will have a nice little fun chocolate surprise in the center [Music] all right so just remember if you do put chocolate and some remember which ones have the chocolate in there because the other ones that don't have chocolate you're gonna put chocolate on the top of so I'm gonna put these in my oven once it gets preheated mm-hmm and then I'm going to take them out and I'll show you what they look like but it's gonna take about nine minutes you just want to go until the bottom starts getting a little bit Brown so you might want to after about like eight minutes maybe just check one and see how Brown the bottom is because they can get burnt on the bottom pretty quickly so I like to go about nine minutes but we'll see how it goes all right so once you get it out of the oven basically like I said you're looking for the bottoms to just start to turn brown like that they do go really quickly so check them because different this is a difference of like a minute or two can make a huge difference but basically immediately once you get them out of the oven the ones that you did not stuff with chocolate you're gonna want to take your little chocolate bars and press them down immediately [Music] all right so the ones that you press the chocolate into those chocolate bars are gonna melt a little bit and then as they cool they're gonna kind of reset but they're still gonna be a little bit softer and it's just gonna be the perfect chocolate punch for the cookies but I do like eating them hot when they're kind of melty and that's super good these ones we already have chocolate inside of so what I'm gonna do is take my melted chocolate which all I did was take the chocolate and put it in just the chocolate bar I didn't add anything to it I just microwaved it in 15 second increments I'm about thirty seconds total and stirred in between until it got to this nice consistency so I'm just gonna take this little spoon and I'm going to drizzle over them but actually I'm gonna move them to the cooling rack first so let's do that I really like these baking trays that I have all links is a specific baking tray it seems to cook things very evenly when you're baking on these cut this it's this specific kind of tray that I used and then just move it all to the cooling rack [Music] [Music] and that is everything so you can get as creative as you want with these you could dip them in the chocolate you could you know do whatever you want but I like to just do a couple like a couple of different variations and you have a nice tray of cookies and well cookie bites as I like to call them and they're super tasty the only part is just try not to eat the whole tray I did freeze some of mine that seems to help me keep from eating a bunch of them and they will just if you just let them like thought you know thought at room temperature they will taste super delicious even a few weeks down the road so let's get Brian back in here so we can try these out [Music] [Music] peak and I baked oh nice you and tri-zone sure so we have our cookies these are actually ones that I made last night because the ones that I just made are gonna be photographed and all that so check out our blog at Crocs in the kitchen comm and you can check out our website there's a link in the description below and you'll get the whole recipe with all the amounts and photos and all that exciting stuff mm-hmm she puts a lot of time and effort into those blog posts so go check them out are you ready to try it yes a try which one first um I don't know how you choose um let's go for this one so okay we're gonna go for the ones that do not have chocolate inside they have a chocolate bar on the top nice I like that it's not too sweet it's got that bitterness from the dark chocolate which you know I'm not huge on dark chocolate but that works really well because it balances but it's chewy and I get what you mean by it's not really like a cookie but they're kind of like cookie bites it's a cookie bite it's a cookie right oh all right so far your about a thousand I do like the fact that they're chewy because sometimes with cookies I feel like you just eat them and then they're just gone and this you can kind of enjoy you know yeah it's more like a an interesting little baked treat yeah you know yes I like I like these ones because they have the hidden chocolate surprise inside yo and actually these ones that we're eating I did an experiment and froze them overnight to see how the freezing would do and I think it went well all right all right go for it uh-huh not the chocolate I know I don't know if you guys can see that or not I think I like these a little bit better I don't know why I didn't do all good stuff yeah so I took these out of the freezer and microwave them for like 10 seconds that's why they're still there the chocolates a little melty mm-hmm perfect great job mmm thank you now I know she said this in the beginning that she loves to bake and that is absolutely true in the past she would just make a ton of cookies you know for holidays and stuff like that and absolutely fantastic she she makes amazing cookies and so to see something like this I'm looking forward to seeing what you can come up with in the future because this was entirely her recipe I had nothing to do with this one because baking it just eludes me I don't know how to do it but yeah yeah I definitely want to try some more things out because I still haven't been all that like I I still haven't done up cookie you know the cookie kind of cookie um I think everything kind of turns out more dense and so that's something I'm definitely gonna work on trying to figure out how to get that fluffy kind of you know but yeah I think I'm excited to experiment unfortunately I feel like I can't experiment a ton just because I will eat like the entire tray of whatever I make and so it's yeah that I get so I didn't want to talk about the chocolate for a second I know I talked about it earlier and I know I talk about chocolate all the time chocolate is my favorite but so I'd use these Lily's chocolate bars like I said they're sweetened with stevia the thing is if you can't find these and you don't have these I will put links below on where you can buy them but if you can't find these they do sell them at Whole Foods and like a couple of grocery local grocery stores we I've seen them at but if you can't find them you can use any of your favorite vegan chocolate bars so if you guys have you can even use like vegan chocolate chips and just do like the chocolate drizzle stuff some of the chocolate chips and the inside that kind of thing so whatever kind of vegan chocolate you can find now I don't like to use you know with refined sugar and all that kind of stuff so I do really like these Lilly's ones just because they don't have any of that but yeah if you don't have that chocolate don't fear just find some other vegan chocolate you can find photos of

horns up if you love cheesecake now I've done a recipe or two for cheesecake on this channel I've done a delicious lemon and strawberry cheesecake I've done a berry swirl cheesecake and you can click here on the I button and watch those recipes but I've never done a no-bake cheesecake so for all my viewers who don't have an oven today we're going to be doing the most incredible and delicious no bake peanut butter cheesecake with a delicious chocolate ganache on top whoo yeah it's going to be incredible anyway enough jibber-jabber let's get cooking oh and you remember a couple of episodes ago we made some peanut butter cookies click on the I button and make those because we're going to need it for this recipe so the first thing we're going to do for this recipe is make some brown butter and we're gonna get a saucepan on the stove and put in about 75 grams of salted butter you can also use unsalted butter no problem and now you just want to let the butter cook it's going to melt down and the milk solids are going to separate and then they're going to start to brown and that's what's gonna make this delicious brown butter now of course you need to keep an eye on this keep stirring it you don't want the heat to be too high because it can go from brown butter to burnt butter in no time so keep stirring it don't get scared if it starts to froth up take it off the heat if you need to every once in a while keep stirring it around with a spoon or a spatula and once that turns a nice golden brown just pour it out in some kind of a dish and let it cool now for the base of this cheesecake we're going to be using those lovely keto peanut butter cookies that we made now there are a couple of ways to deal with these cookies one just put it in a bowl and with the blunt end of a rolling pin just smash the cookie and powder it up the other option is to put it in a ziplock bag and then bash it away with the rolling pin and the option I prefer the most is to put the cookies in your food processor and give it all the good blitz once it's blitzed up I'm going to take it out in the bowl so that you can see what I'm doing but honestly you can continue this process in the food processor anyway into this goes two tablespoons of Dutch processed cocoa powder you can also use regular unsweetened cocoa powder no problem give that all a good mix and make sure it's all well combined now because the cookies are already sweetened I am NOT adding any additional sweetener to this anyway once you are done with that for in the brown butter once it has cooled down and then give it all a good mix this is going to be a delicious nutty chocolaty base for the cheesecake of course you don't have to brown the butter I just do that to take it to the next level you can just use regular melted butter if you like anyway once that's done we are going to pour it out into our cake tin and then you're going to spread it around evenly make sure you spread it round evenly you can use your spatula for this you can use a spoon for this you can even use your fingers just do whatever is easiest once you are done with that pop it in the freezer to chill for about 15 minutes the next thing I'm going to do is take about 100 ml of heavy whipping cream and then whip that to soft peaks we are going to be adding this to the cheesecake to lighten it up also I am doing this first so that I don't have to wash the beaters when I make the filling it's a little hack anyway once the cream has been whipped to soft peaks it's time to get on to our cream cheese filling so we're going to use about 400 grams of cream cheese and give it a good whipping with the electric whisker now you need to make sure that your cheese is at room temperature I cannot stress this enough room temperature not from the fridge once that's nice and smooth it's time to add the other ingredients and I am adding in about 200 grams of peanut butter all-natural and unsweetened I'm also going to add in some vanilla extract about a teaspoon and stevia to taste you can also use a powdered sweetener no problem and then give that all a good mix now folks you can also use a powdered sweetener no problem and sweeten it to taste make sure that you taste the filling once it's all whipped in anyway once you're done whipping that it's time to fold in the cream so pour in that cream that we whipped to soft peaks and then fold it all together to get a nice creamy mixture be gentle with this you've taken some time to put some air into that cream and you don't want to deflate the entire mixture but make sure everything is well incorporated once that's done get your base out of the fridge and pour in that cream cheese filling make sure you smoothen it out you can give it a little tap tap and a little shake shake to make sure it's all well settled and then you pop it in the fridge for at least 6 hours now we are going to make our chocolate ganache and I'm going to take 100 ml of heavy whipping cream and put it in a saucepan I'm going to put the saucepan on the stove and bring it up to a simmer meanwhile I am going to chop up about 80 grams of dark chocolate now I'm using link 85 but you can use 100% chocolate if you get that where you live anyway chop it up put it in a bowl and let's get back to that cream once your cream has reached a simmer just pour it over the chocolate and then give it all a good mix and you will see a lovely chocolate ganache being made of course you can add some extra stevia to taste if you want it sweeter you can also use some powdered sweetener no problem anyway once everything is mixed well set it aside and let it cool once that's cooled it's time to finish the cheesecake and I put it in cling film because I left it in my fridge overnight anyway pour that ganache over the cheesecake spread it around you can use your spatula or you can like I am doing try and be all fancy and well I don't know if this was smart or stupid but hey I got the job done I turned the thing round and round and I shook it around without breaking and destroying anything and managed to cover the entire top of it with the chocolate ganache anyway then pop it in the fridge to chill for another hour or two the longer the better alright folks it's the moment of truth where I pop open that springform pan and I'm using a damp hot cloth to just loosen the sides a bit so just wrap it around for a second or two get rid of the clock and snap open that cheesecake springform pan and ho yes everything went well I didn't destroy it it looks good and Yahoo it's come out quite alright if you ask me now it's time to cut into that cheesecake and a little tip is to dip your knife in hot water then wipe it clean and cut the cheesecake and then you're supposed to dip it again and clean it but I forgot to do that so I dug it up my cheesecake a little bit but nothing that a well a tissue paper can't fix anyway our cheesecake is done I've cut out a slice and it's not a complete disaster it looks really delicious and I can't wait to taste it anyway enough jibber-jabber time to taste alright folks so it's time to taste our peanut butter cheesecake and boy oh boy this was one of the hardest recipes for me to film and execute properly and I made quite a few mistakes as you may have noticed but hey you know what my wife is the dessert Queen I generally make the savory stuff so this was a good learning experience for me a good challenge and there is so much information I need to share with you guys so please make sure you go to headbangers kitchen comm to get the written recipe with the macros and all the additional information that i want to share with you but I am going to tell you this right here this cake is about 5,000 plus calories so you gotta eat it in moderation but anyway enough jibber-jabber time to taste stick it okay I don't know what to say I just going to eat another bite pure sin I mean you're gonna have to cut this cake into 16 slices and lock away what you're not going to eat because wow this just I could eat the entire cake that's 5,000 calories in one sitting that brown butter in the in the base just takes it to the next level and it's if you think about it it's just peanut butter cookie base peanut butter filling and chocolate on top and I normally hate chocolate in cheesecakes but here everything works in perfect harmony anyway I hope you guys are gonna make this peanut butter cheesecake and of course take a picture tag me on instagram share it with me on facebook and i guess i will see you on the next episode of

microwave this for about a minute minute and a half until it's completely melted check it every 30 seconds or so just so you can mix it up to nothing scorches once it's completely melted you can add in 1 teaspoon of vanilla in a separate Bowl you want to combine 1 cup of sugar along with two eggs and mix that up well before you add your other ingredients once it's combining you can add in a half

190 year old crumbling house in marion alabama and are these things behind you um just some like vintage things that you've collected serve where over the years yeah so it's over a lifetime yeah definitely i mean we could spend a whole zoom interview just you telling the stories of where you found each of those but i suppose that's not what we're here to talk about today for now i guess we should we should talk about this recipe you have said that this is your favorite cookie from childhood is that correct absolutely yeah unquestionably me my i feel myself blushing just thinking about that yeah and i i just got like a little bit of a sugar high i think we bit yeah well can you tell us about this recipe the story behind it yes they're a cookie that my mother made for my sister and myself from when i was very young like five and younger um and they were special always special and she didn't make them that often and we would have to sometimes beg to have her make them for us and sometimes dangle them as a incentive to get us to behave or do something that if we would do this she would make the cookies for us so um and they've been my favorite since the first i ever ate although i honestly don't know the exact origin of the of the recipe i'm i do feel confident that it was one of those convenience um in the same you know when we started getting recipes i had a can of this and a package of this and that i guess test kitchens were developing or someone was developing to use those so uh and my best guess is that it probably emerged sometime in the 50s but i really don't know that at all but it has that feeling to me and then you said that your sister janet became sort of the expert in the family correct she's three years older than i am and she she was the first allowed to take to the stove and so when she learned to make them which i don't remember that age but they they showed up a lot more in the house and she became very good at making them and she could also she perfected the half batch i would make half batches of them sometimes very quickly and sometimes more than once in a week so although you had to fight her to get your amount because she could eat them all so i think now would be a perfect time to go move over to the kitchen and then make these cookies which will take about five minutes yes okay we can start making cheese i'm gonna have trouble looking at his cookies she's beautiful and clearly intelligent clearly has good taste [Laughter] okay i have everything set up here um right here i have the oats which are the quick cooking oats and some crunchy peanut butter and some vanilla and just really quickly before i stir those together in the first step of the recipe if you needed to swap in smooth peanut butter or if you only had rolled oats absolutely absolutely absolutely yeah i went through a phase when i was just all about the crunchy and i still like the crunchy but smooth peanut butter a lot of recipes will call for smooth peanut butter the other thing too is like i remember as a kid the the nightmare part for me i just thought trying to mix that peanut butter and the oats all together was like really difficult and not fun they don't have to be mixed all that well you know i mean it's good to break it up a little bit but the hot pot will fix a lot of that that's so comforting because i was just trying to figure out how i'm going to make sure it's even with essentially one hand great okay so i'm scraping my peanut butter in okay vanilla is going in you helping okay and by the way i'm so glad that you said that your sister was the master of the half batch because i am also making a half batch right now oh good all these amounts will look maybe a bit smaller than if you're making the full batch of the recipe um but that's simply because i was running a little low on sugar this is the great thing i mean it's very adaptable and i haven't tried to make it with brown sugar before but i don't know why it wouldn't work if you need it it sounds delicious i would love to try it so i am turning my stove on to in the book it says moderate heat what would you would that be like medium medium high medium high i mean the thing is you want to you want to try to bring it up fairly quickly but without scorching or burning anything um and i'm not worried about you scorching or burning anything well i'm i'm certainly capable of burning all sorts of things you're doing great great thank you so i'm adding my butter and my milk to this pot to start melting together as soon as it's melted or even as soon as it's almost melted because it will be warmed up then i think then you can go ahead and add the sugar and the cocoa to it and just make sure there are no lumps because the cocoa can lump up a little bit she's really determined to climb up uh the tripod right my butter has just melted i'm dumping in my sugar oops that was a big splash and then okay sugar just went in cocoa is going in and a little bit of salt and now i'm just going to start whisking it together and i love how it so quickly turns to something that looks like almost a thin brownie batter yes yes it does and it has that little shine to it like like brownie batter does and i'm all for it so okay just to update people on where we are with the recipe i have whisked together and i'm just waiting for it to come up to a boil and then it'll boil for one wait is this the one and a half minutes or it's one and a half minutes yes i mean that's yeah and that's that's pretty good i mean the thing is you want to see some big bubbles coming up i think once you see the big bubbles that's and obviously the longer you cook it at this stage the less you'll cook it once you add the oats and i think it is good to let it cook a bit so it could even be undercooked a little bit here i'm making everything way too complicated but we really just want i think in that you just want to see it come to a boil to a good boil before you add the oats and the peanut butter i have one other question about the cocoa which is i know you have said you like just kind of like the the basic commercial kind that you grew up with well i mean in terms of that flavor i mean i've used fancy imported cocoas and i liked that too but again for me this this cookie you know it's the nostalgia that i'm going for when i make it well i think i may be okay by the way little bubbles have just started breaking so i'll just whisk here and there until the big bubbles show up and i'll just keep an eye on the minutes too just as a backup um so i think i am probably going to have a similar flavor because i have dutch process cocoa and i have heard that that is like kind of the nostalgic brownie flavor no that is hot hot grapes i'm not going to touch that i'm going to give you a peek at the bubbling oh i'd love i'd love to see that yeah that's i i think you can add your oatmeal at any at any point i think that's just about right for the timing too i'm going to scrape my oat mixture in well it's a perfectly written recipe exactly the proof's in the pudding scott 17 years later on an electric stove so scott what what should we be looking for here well it'll definitely be getting thicker don't want it to cook so much that it starts pulling away from the sides of the pan um you know or starts um forming a ball because then that's not going to spoon out so you want to see it thickening and um i'm going to give you a peek again if you can see that's looking pretty good and it's got that great shine um you could probably let it go just a tiny bit longer but i think i i think you can go ahead and start spooning those you see how it's holding its shape yeah you like it yeah that's beautiful okay great so good to me spoon away all right let's spoon i have a question scott which is would you recommend that i take it off of the warmth of the burner while i scoop or keep it on i think i'd keep it on because if it starts cooling down too much you'll have trouble okay or or maybe move it back and forth just gauge how it's doing because it you don't want it to set in the pan and sometimes that can happen oh i'm gonna do my little trick that i learned from our social media manager for my parchment i'm sure you've seen this before but when your parchment is like or your wax paper is still holding the shape of the roll right oh no i didn't know that that's pretty great yeah i was because then you can get it to lay flat now i'm worried about your cookies cooling off too much before you spoon them out and then once they cool off too much there's kind of no going back right yeah i've tried adding water or warm milk or stuff and you can you know you can usually loosen it up but it's never the same and you get kind of that chalky look um you don't seem to be having any problems at all though right now it's okay um d when you scoop these i'm assuming you use like two spoons and just kind of scrape it off and sometimes it's even still soft enough that i can just use one spoon but usually before it's over you're down to two spoons and that's great too because then you get to like those spoons so and as you're doing those drops are you trying to kind of like nudge them into a roundish shape i usually let them just do it on their own which is another reason another thing like if you spoon them before they start cooling too much in the pan when they'll they'll sort of spread out kind of um they spread themselves in other words otherwise you can nudge them out a little bit but there's no wrong to it you know i mean they're gonna be amazing regardless and i've had them when they were like nuggets you know as opposed to a flat disc i'll give you a quick peek at mine so far oh this looks perfect those look really really really really good oh that's great that's really really good yeah i'm so happy to hear that i'm getting down to the bottom and i feel very proud because um it's still gooey at the bottom i'm still able to spell that's an accomplishment yeah that was not um through the last time i made them and so we got those little crumbly bits that we will certainly sprinkle on ice cream no your spoons look great that's what i've been looking at like the the texture on the spoons like how much is on there and the way it's uh hanging on the way it's distributed so um and it's all still staying pretty glossy too the stuff on the spoons i think that keeping it on the warmth of the burner has really been helping with that yes and our daughter continues to try to climb the tripod sorry for the shaky shot all right i think that is my last cookie while still leaving some in the pot to scrape up later for oh yes a treat okay one sec one's like little one here do you want to see our cookies i want to see our cookies come here look at our cookies um so okay this is this is a good illustration of what what you get the first ones i got were kind of a little like more relaxed and loose and puddly and the last ones were just a little moundier but still um you know not those those look i i can smell it oh those look really really really really good so those are the first ones and then those are the the last ones yeah which will still be good oh yeah that's fantastic we did it yeah you did it's fantastic yes i enjoy this so much i love watching make those cookies and i am so glad i don't have the ingredients to make them i'm so grateful what is for you the perfect moment that you would be able to take that first warm bite i would have already had a spoon in my mouth and that would have happened uh and then the other thing is i'm saying as soon as you can comfortably peel one off the paper then it's always good to eat one of that at that stage there are nuances and aspects to it that are present immediately and then and and certain of those um are only there momentarily and they're gone in three or four minutes but there are others that weren't there three or four minutes ago so it's quite a journey and and like it makes it such a rich experience these are not just boiled cookies they are like they're boil cookies that have a lifespan even like when on the rare occasions my mother would make them and they didn't set like even the next day they still had not set um we would eat them with spoons off the wax paper and we didn't like them any less i mean they were still as exciting and delicious and um thrilling you know i mean it was that's exciting so you you you've got a lot of forgiveness here go ahead taste it won't you i mean i would have by now so it is just such a like it really does take you back somewhere um if you've had this combination of flavors in some form before like for me it's always it's always the chocolate that's in the for ground it's not the peanut butter like i don't think i typically even think of peanut butter when i eat those cookies no it's very true and there's not a lot of peanut butter in here you know i think of peanut butter cookies as having peanut butter as a primary ingredient but this only calls for a half cup in the full recipe so it is just sort of like a seasoning or a flavoring for the chocolate right yes i think so too because even the oats don't really come through to me for me it it is like a like a really like a chocolate cookie with a really unique texture yeah it's very special oh i've loved it so much thank you so much for for making them and including me and it feels like you're right here with me and i love that it does i mean i don't i don't feel separated really at all except the fact that i can't grab the spam yeah one last thing which is that i didn't have a moment to to show this cover before because we were in the thick of

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "AFT9kh5HyBw": "hi there I'm gonna be making my prize-winning peanut butter cookies these are very easy to do and I love making them nice peanut butter flavor in them you can use creamy or chunky whatever you prefer let me set up the ingredients and I will show you how to make them okay so these are the ingredients I need to make my peanut butter cookies we've got all purpose flour we've got some white sugar some brown sugar salt peanut butter eggs vegetable shortening and some baking soda I'll also need some hot tap water when I'm mixing this up but I'll just get that from the tap when I need it I'll get everything set up and we'll make some peanut butter cookies okay so I've got my mixer set up and I've got my ingredients all ready my oven is preheating to 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 180 degrees Celsius in my mixer bowl I am going to put in my sugar so it's very easy a cup of white sugar and a cup of brown sugar I'm using a dark brown sugar and I'm just gonna stir that round to break up the sugar and mix them together you're okay and then to that I'm going to add my cup of shortening which is just a stick of shortening and I'm just gonna put that straight in and medium there we go all right and now that I've got that and I need to add in two egg white there sorry full eggs that I've beaten already so given those a light beat together and we'll just add those in and mix them in excellent so that's all mixed in nice and well and I'm going to add in my three cups of flour so leave the mixer going just on a low speed just adding it a cup at a time step two a little bit back down to the sister and in our last alright and damn just scrape all that back into the bowl and now I'm going to add in my half teaspoon of salt there we go top the bowl back up mix button okay and I need a teaspoon of baking soda since I've already got the half teaspoon Eric what is two of those so pop that in and mix better okay so now our dough is getting quite sex this is where the hot water comes in so we're going to put in two tablespoons of hot water and this is just tap water so you don't need to boil water anything that's just two tablespoons of hot water to loosen the dough up a little son lower that down just scrape this back into the bowl yo and now we're gonna add in our cup of peanut butter and I am just using a natural peanut butter so it's not as sweetened sort of Skippy style one I'm using Smuckers but you can use you can use absolutely use the Jif or Skippy or whatever peanut butter really that you have if you prefer chunky peanut butter then go ahead and use that as well that works well if you're using a sweetened peanut butter it'll just make your cookies a little bit sweeter but they'll still ache the same I have used that as well but you've already got a cup of white sugar and a cup of brown sugar in there so I quite like using the natural peanut butter which is a little bit less mix that all in and I'm gonna give it a little bit scrape off the beater it's more getting stuck to the beat or anything this is a very thick dough but obviously you're gonna make them into little round balls and squish them onto your baking sheet so you want to make sure that they don't fall apart and also it means that it's quite sick to mix all right so that looks oh my some incorporated and that is my cookie dough so I'll get my baking sheets ready and I will come back in and show you how to roll them out and use a little fork to make the pattern on the top okay so I've got my cookie sheet here I've talked a piece of baking paper or baking parchment on the top of it that just allows it to be easier to clean up at the end of the day by all means if you don't have it you don't need it you can just put the cookie straight onto the cookie sheet I'm also going to be using a cookie scoop today so all that does is allows me to have all of my cookies to be the same size which means that they bake all at the same time so really easy to use into the bowl with the dough I just scrape it up the side like that so then it's full and you just squeeze the handle and it releases the cookie bowl onto the cookie sheet so you just go through and very easily it makes it very quick so just go through they're all the same size so they bake at the same time so it's very very easy to do now I just want to point out that these are quite rough so when you use this little tool they do kind of leave that rough kind of edge on the outside of your cookie now they will bake like that these do spread a little bit but they will bake with a rougher edge around them if you want a rounder cookie you can still use the cookie scoop to get the same size cookies but once you do this then you just pop it into your hand give it a little roll and then you end up with a Rando Bowl so when you bake that and it spreads then you get the round cookie on the outside rather than sort of a rough cookie it really depends on the look that you're going for they'll both bake at the same time and it's just a purely cosmetic look to it whether you want sort of the more rough or around their side so I'll do another round one so again just scrape the dough up the side pop it into your hand give it a little roll form it into your little ball and there you go save got a little round one as well so I'm going to go ahead and do that with the rest of my cookies and then I'll come back and show you how you put the little pattern on the top of that you see for a lot of peanut butter cookies and that I'm going to use for this one you okay so there we go we've got the cookies ready to go now to make the little patter on the top I'm going to use a fork and all you do is press it in the top just like that in one direction and then you go back through and you do the other direction so very easy and that gives you that little crisscross pattern on the top of the cookies so I'm going to go ahead and do all of these and then we'll put them in the oven you okay so I've got true trays done ready to go in the oven I'm going to pop them into the oven for about seven minutes and then I'm gonna have a check and I'm probably gonna swap trays around and then do another seven minutes or so so that 14 minutes total and you're just looking for them to be slightly golden brown and then they're ready to come out of the oven so I will get all of mine baked and my other batch in the oven and I will come back when they are finished okay I just wanted to do a little side build my cookies are cooking in the oven the other thing you can do is use a piece of baking parchment or another cookie tray if you've got an extra cookie tray that's even better because you can get your cookies ready to go to swap the trays out if you don't you can still get them all ready to go on a piece of baking parchment the dough is nice and stiff so the cookies are easy to transfer from somewhere else onto your cookie sheet so you can actually go through and make all your little cookie mountains ready to go and if you're making the balls rolling the balls out you can actually roll out all your bowls ready to go like that so that once your cookie sheets are ready to go again you've got your cookies already made and you just transfer them over and it's nice and quick because these cookies don't really stick it all you can actually go through and make your imprints on all your cookies as well so the cookie is actually ready to go and then you can just really quickly they move they attach very easily just transfer them over to cookie sheet and away you go so just a little time-saving tip if you need some extra time okay so these are my finished peanut butter cookies I let them cool on their baking sheet for about five minutes before I transfer them to a wire rack I will let them finish cooling on the wire rack you just need to let them cool basically until they're cool enough to eat this recipe makes 56 cookies that using that inch and a half diameter scoop you can vary the size depending on the size of cookies you want just make sure you just the cooking time

else I'm up to thanks very much for watching and enjoy", "f5t6BgmEXik": "[Music] today I'm gonna show you to make some keto peanut butter cookies that's so easy to throw together literally just take a few minutes okay so you're going to need one cup of peanut butter that's an unsweetened or natural peanut butter two tablespoons of erythritol or your sweetener of choice this is a blend of erythritol and stevia one teaspoon of cocoa powder some salt to taste and 1 large egg you're also going to need a cookie sheet that's been lined with parchment or baking paper and pre-heat your oven to 300 feet or about 150 Celsius so you want a medium to large sized bowl and correct the egg in there to start with to that we'll add the peanut butter cup here's half of that 1 cup olive and then add your sweetener as well and then you can use a whisk if you like I just think it's gonna be pretty thick so I'm just gonna go ahead and use my spoon to mix those together that egg well incorporate together no I had the one teaspoon of cocoa powder and it just says salt to taste so I'm just gonna put a bit of a pinch in there stir it again now to mix everything together really well I actually just found it easier just to get my hands in there and swish it around it's not overly wet or anything or sticky you really want to get that cocoa powder mixed in well okay so what I've done easiest is that just split the actual dough in half and I took the first half and I'm just roll it out into sort of a long log shape back and forth a bit press it together if it seems to come apart it should hold together fairly well until you get it into kind of an well unfortunate looking shape I suppose given the color but from there I've found an easier then just to sort of cut it in half then cut each half and half again and then each one of those in half again it just say you get about 15 cookies this way you're gonna get 16 but it's just easier to get it all nice and even and then I just kind of roll them til they're rounded a bit we're gonna flatten them anyways on the pan I'm just gonna set those chicken Leone in the pan you shouldn't really spread too much so you know there were too much about having them close together I've got one extra obviously to move a little bit I'm just using the back of your spoon you just want to flatten them a little bit into a cookie shape if you do find they crumble apart at all wonder to him did just squish them right back together they'll hold fine now we're just gonna pop that into a preheated oven for about 15 minutes you don't seem to be browning at all and I did give him an extra few minutes but I think I'm gonna go ahead and pull them out so I'm gonna leave those sit for a few minutes they're really hot the recipe does say to serve them warm but if you try to pick them up when they're too hot I think they'll just fall apart so I'm gonna give me just a few minutes so there you have it keto peanut butter cookies they're very tasty I'm the gun nice texture and everything they're maybe slightly dry or crumbly just a little bit that could also be because I left them in for an extra few minutes because they didn't Brown as expected but I make these again they're very good hope you enjoy it [Music]", "tRVDDiEoTQk": "so today i made air fried peanut butter cookies first you want to start off with 220 grams of butter then add 100 grams

little bit in a bowl and add it in four tablespoons and to sweeten it you can use raw sugar cane sugar I prefer honey so four tablespoons of raw unpasteurized natural honey I picked this one from my local bee farmer from local farmers market so adding four tablespoons of honey in and then we will combine all these ingredients with some baking powder 1 teaspoon of fat and that's it just use your fork spatula you don't even need a mixer blender for this your peanut butter cookie dough is ready you can freeze it and just prepare some fresh cookies to enjoy with hot chocolate or glass of milk and when you're ready to cook preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit use parchment paper on a baking sheet place small teaspoon sizes of your dough and then press them down with pack off your spoon or with your fingers now they tend to rise a lot and then you tend to grow in size so just very very small quantity and then cook them for 8 to 10 minutes at 350 Fahrenheit they will be ready in no time let them cool down otherwise they will pray because they don't have any egg or anything or no flour that's it so your delicious cookies are ready go ahead give them a try hope you like this recipe video I will see you soon so please do stay tuned to eat East Indian Channel", "IlErvBp2wbM": "- Hey, you're watching\nPreppy Kitchen, where I, John Kanell, teach you how to\nmake delicious homemade dishes to share with your family and friends. Today, I'm making some amazingly delicious peanut butter blossoms because\nthere's a special play-date later today and they\ncome together in a snap. Let's get started. If you haven't noticed, I am\nstill in the rental house. The renovations are dragging on a bit, but that's how it always is. I've never heard someone say, \"oh, we're ahead of\nschedule, this is amazing.\" Really looking forward\nto that new kitchen. The bowl in my stand mixer,\nI'm adding half a cup or 113 grams of unsalted butter, three quarters of a cup\nof smooth peanut butter, in you go, and for this recipe,\nand actually most baking, you want to use a peanut\nbutter that has a little bit of a stabilizer in it, so\nnormally like a supermarket brand, or, you know, those Skip,\nJiffy situations work well. The natural ones that\nyou have to mix, mix, mix can be slightly problematic,\nso just an FYI or heads up. (gentle music) Let's give this a really quick mix. Just to cream them together a little bit. Now, when I was a child and unsupervised, I would love toast with butter and then peanut butter on top. Half a cup of white sugar in there. It's 100 grams. And (clicks tongue) half a cup of lightly\ntemped down brown sugar. In you go. Let's cream this together. Let the mixer run. Fluffy, lighter color. Scrape it down. (gentle music) Whenever you're rolling cookies, it's especially good to make\nsure you scrape things down several times because\nyou don't want to have any bits at the bottom that are runnier and the bits at the top\nare drier or whatever. You want nice, uniform balls. Time for a teaspoon of vanilla, in you go. And one egg. Room temperature is best. It'll incorporate more easily. (mixer whirring) Then you want to mix it up\nuntil it's well combined. Okay, you can see the\ncolor is way lighter. The consistency is nice and fluffy. You can give it a final\nscrape if you want. You know I'm a Virgo so it's\na little fastidious sometimes. Now that our mixture is light and fluffy and it's been scraped down, we can add in our flour and baking powder. Just mix on low. Every time, I mean. (beep) (mixer whirring) So doesn't need that much to mix together. One final scrape and it looks\npretty homogenous and nice. You can chill the dough at this point. But I want to show you\nit's actually really nice and the peanut butter does some magic so you can just roll it\nup into a ball right away. It's totally fine so we're just\ngonna go onto the next step but you could make this in\nadvance, chill it for a while, bring it out, you'll\nprobably want it to come a little bit closer to\nroom temperature though because it'll be harder to roll, just FYI. So now I have a little bit of\nan assembly line set up here. I think peanut butter\nblossoms are an anytime treat but they're very popular\non holiday cookie platters, so I have a couple options for you. Number one, and this is the easiest one, is you just roll the cookies out into roughly one inch balls,\ndoesn't have to be totally the same, just roll it out,\nplop it on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper,\nand you're gonna bake. The little bit of an\nupgrade that I like to do is to get some sanding\nsugar, and sanding sugar, if you don't know, is\nlike granulated sugar but the granules are a little bit bigger so the sugar has some\nmore crunch and sparkle, which are things I wholeheartedly endorse. Just roll, roll, roll the cookie\ndough in the sanding sugar and now you can place\nit on the baking sheet. But if you happen to have\nsome colored sanding sugar on hand, like I do, you\ncan use that as well, so just roll it out again,\nand then there you go. Now it becomes very\nsparkly and super holiday. I will say that it will stain your hands a bit so just watch out because there is food\ncoloring in the sugar. Okay let's do a green one. Plop, plop, plop. I really like the way any of\nthe sugar enhances this cookie because it gives it that sparkle\nand it gives it that crunch and it's a nice play of textures because the cookie is a\nlittle bit on the softer side, and you have that melt-y chocolate on top, so some crunch will do you good. And if you're doing\nthis, the best practice is to do it one color at a\ntime, so that you don't end up with multicolor sparkles\nall over the place. I like to roll these out to\nabout an inch in diameter which was roughly 36 grams\nwhen I checked it (laughs) I just like that size because it gives you a nice little blossom\naround the peanut butter. You can go bigger if you want, it's really just me being\nkind of a crazy person. If you have little ones in the kitchen, this is an excellent time for them to start unwrapping\nthose chocolate kisses. Does any other company make\nthem besides Hershey's? I feel like they're only Hershey's kisses but there must be like a generic, right? The first batch is ready\nto go into the oven. 375 for about seven minutes. They're not gonna be done baking because you have to pop\nthose little kisses on top. All right, into the oven. So seven minutes later, you can-- Oh, so slippery. Seven minutes later you can see they've puffed up a little bit. They are ever so slightly\nbrowned on the bottom. And all we wanna do is plop\nthat kiss on top and press. It'll crack. It's supposed to crack. Don't worry. That being said you want to move quickly because you don't want\nthem to harden up on you. These are gonna go back\ninto the oven at 375 for three minutes, so set your timer. It's very important. These are hot as fire. I'm not gonna touch them yet but look how beautiful that is. Chocolates are all nice and glossy and I just wanna show you, these really have to set. So they're out of the\noven, they're done baking, but they're too soft to handle, so you have to let them cool down and they'll set and harden up\njust like many other cookies that you've probably baked in your life. Just wanted to mention that\nin case you didn't know. Once it cools down a\nlittle bit, it'll be nice and molten and soft. You don't have to use\nthese kisses in the middle. Any chocolate you want. You could just leave them\nas peanut butter balls. Candied pecan, hello. Or a walnut on top for some crunch. Or even some roasted peanuts. How 'bout them apples? So which one do you like the best? I gotta tell you, I love\nhaving a pop of color on a holiday cookie platter, but for me, I love the plain white sanding sugar because it has peanut\nbutter color coming through and it's very like, hello, I'm a peanut butter cookie, eat me.

and my review on this flavor I'm going to be doing this in a couple of ways one is protein pudding mixed in yogurt one is a generic shake which I'm going to mix up here in just a little bit with about six houses a melt and of course people know me as chef Bob so I'm definitely gonna be cooking some cookies Nutter butters and everything exactly like people would want out of the protein powder so cutting right to the chase what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mix one scoop into my ginger here and I'm in offseason so I need to put it on the damn scale so I'm just gonna level this off real quick do that real quick aroma smells like the open atv2 kind of container so peanut butter is pretty heavy on that I'll be interested to see how this stacks up against metabolic nutrition and peanut butter cookie peanut butter syntha-6 and also what's the other good one thus far he has a good peanut butter cookie PDS has been Ravens they're flavoring so I'm gonna put this on the blender mix it up come back with my taste test and where this falls in the ranks of the PBS science flavors and look at that it's already mixed six ounces of almond milk one scoop of the p/es peanut butter cookie and we have the final product here now it's not pouring you let's see where this tastes currently my favorites are vanilla and the limited edition white chocolate mint I'm not a min person but the white chocolate overpowers it so therefore I enjoy it both of those flavors mix exceptionally thick another reason why I do enjoy the PS select snickerdoodles my current number three let's see if this can fall into the top three here's my consensus on how to break this down the peanut butter cookie peanut butter flavor great some peanut butter proteins have a little salty aftertaste this does not it literally reminds me of a PB 2 or a PB lean from my oatmeal calm with just like an enhanced flavoring now in the aftertaste is where you do taste the cookie and to me you get a little bit of marshmallow and you get a little bit of like a sugar cookie kind of complementarity mixture of everything together not as dense as the chocolate peanut butter but if you do enjoy sweeter peanut butter flavors this is going to be a home run I personally enjoy it and I like sweeter things but it does not top vanilla or white chocolate mint I'll probably put this down my number 3 as far as favorite flavor goes other ways that you like to enjoy it is that mix with yogurt and make a protein pudding and if you follow me an Instagram I will put that in the comment box below also my full written review will be there as well I am going to make Nutter Butter sandwiches which you can see right here I will detail the recipe and everything like that on the anabolic - forms but wanted to say PDS great job appreciate the insider sales for $20 of tub if you did miss out sorry just got it in today also I didn't have to review up earlier thanks to getting PS fantastic work as always", "4n51040UAew": "what's going on guys welcome to the keto connect kitchen we have a very simple delicious peanut butter cookie recipe today and it's only three ingredients we have some peanut butter some powdered erythritol and then one large egg so super simple easy to whip up easy to get your kids involved friends family and one thing to note is that when you're looking for your peanut butter or any nut butter you want it to have one at most two ingredients all this is is just peanuts might see peanuts and salt that is a totally good option too so anything within that range is going to be perfect to use for this recipe and then erythritol is a low carb sweetener some similar sweeteners would be monk fruit or truvia and that might vary in terms of how much you need to use but usually the package tells you like what's the equivalency to sugar for our erythritol which is powdered we're going to be using 1 3 cup so all you really do is you mix everything together you make balls flatten them bake them and then we eat them so let's get started by putting one cup of peanut butter in this bowl so a good trick is to like scoop all around the edges and that'll bring up a lot of the peanut butter so we're looking at 256 grams here it's a lot of peanut butter okay perfect 254. we'll stick with that so i'm going to first add the erythritol and then give that a quick mix so that the peanut butter is not as clumpy when we add in our egg one large egg and then we're gonna keep the simple three ingredients because the dough looks pretty perfect but if you find that maybe you're just too oily still or it doesn't come together like a dough you can add a tablespoon of almond flour and additionally you can add some vanilla extract i think these will be perfect so there's our dough it's really nice and firm and stiff so we're just going to use a cookie scooper and make some balls flatten them and bake them doesn't need to be perfect because we're actually going to just flatten them anyway but i like a little roundness cookies are balled up and i made 12 here you could probably make anywhere from 12 to 15. i decided to use extra dough and just make these guys a little bigger but all we have to do now is flatten them and i'm going to use a fork you could use your palm you could use a spoon whatever really you have we're gonna go classic with a fork so pretty simple we'll give it a little crisscross there oh okay so that looks perfect so all we're gonna do is pop it in the oven 350 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes we'll keep an eye on them the edges will start to get golden brown it might be a little tough to see because they're already like kind of golden brown but you'll be able to notice so we'll be back when they have come out of the oven cooled and then we can taste them all right guys we are back the cookies have fully cooled it's been like an hour and they are perfect they didn't spread at all so whatever size you make them before they go in the oven they will stay the same once they're out and you can tell they're like perfectly cooked they're like nice and golden brown on the bottom slightly on the edges these smell so good they were smelling so peanut butter in the oven and julius was just hovering by the oven and he never does that i love peanut butter those are really really good strong peanut butter perfect amount of sweetness slightly soft slight crunch a really good texture and you can make like sandwiches out of these ice cream sandwiches or like peanut butter sandwiches put some peanut butter in the middle i would even keep these in my freezer maybe after dinner have one or two i know they'll freeze well and taste really good just right out of the freezer but link down below is the recipe and the instructions on exactly how to make this super easy make it tonight make it with your family your friends i guarantee you they'll love it so thanks for watching we'll see you next time you", "E2kUsRIj4tM": "[Music]

figured out to make not necessarily protein peanut butter cookies so i might put that in the video title they are way higher in protein than your normal peanut butter cookies but mainly this is a peanut butter cookie that is not so bad for you and that's because we've reduced the calories and we've upped the total amount of protein but these cookies taste really good and they're very filling and they're very large and satisfying and if you have a peanut butter craving like i often do this will satisfy that if you have a cookie craving a sweet tooth it helps me with that but it doesn't make me you know eat 500 calories worth of cookie in one single sitting so let's go over the ingredients and then i'll show you how to cook it it's actually really easy just like making a normal cookie first of all i start with butter half a stick of butter um i just use real butter i'm not trying to cut calories on the fat fat is not bad for you you do need some fat anyway so we're going to go with the real deal butter you want to have it a little bit warm either room temperature or you can just put it in the microwave for a few seconds before you start mixing for the butter so that's regular salted butter not unsalted butter one cup of this this is monk fruit sweetener i got this from from costco it is a one for one sugar replacement and because it's kind of this golden color it works like what you usually have for peanut butter cookies which is a mixture of white sugar and brown sugar so it tastes like that and it works really good now you can also use something else like this which will be a little bit higher in calories but it's not a one for one so make sure you're following instructions for any sugar replacement that you're using for volume replacement so if you're replacing a cup of sugar this would be half a cup but just follow the instructions i like this better though but it's up to you what you want to do and and what kind of calories you want to put in the sugar so that's a cup of sugar i also put in a half cup of these these are liquid egg whites also from costco and therefore very cheap i get a big case of these every time i go and i eat a lot of egg whites so we're putting that in there that's going to add some moisture and of course more protein this is the real secret here this is pb fit you can also use pb2 basically the same thing it's powdered peanut butter this is peanut butter but it's peanut butter without any of the oil so it's just the peanut protein and the fiber more or less so it's very low in carbs it does have some carbs obviously but it's low in carbs high in protein and very very low in fat so what we're taking out of this is the peanut oil and that's going to reduce uh the calories in the cookie big time but it still tastes really rich like peanuts and in fact we're using twice as much powdered peanut butter as you would normally use regular peanut butter in a traditional peanut butter cookie recipe traditional peanut butter cookies you use half a cup of peanut butter this we're using a full cup of this these things are going to taste very much like peanut butter next is flour so i use 2 3 of a cup of flour now i'm using gluten-free king arthur all-purpose flour this stuff's really good i use gluten-free flour because my wife cannot have gluten so i actually don't have any normal flour in the house although she doesn't really eat these cookies so i guess i could use normal flour for it you can use whatever flour you want you could even experiment with say like whatever cauliflower flour like keto flour if you want to go even lower on the calories or try to cut out all the carbs this is where all the carbohydrates or the vast majority of the carbohydrates in the recipe are going to come from is from this not from the sugar but from the flour and because there's no sugar in this recipe or you know zero added sugar it doesn't give you like a big sugar spike or something it's like eating a piece of bread but it's super high in protein now i so use two thirds a cup of that and i use a third of a cup of casein protein to make one full cup of flour if you want to add more protein to any kind of baked good you can just replace one third of it with casing optionally you could use whey but i think casein works better it makes a thicker cookie it's richer in flavor in general more satisfying so i like the casein i think it matches well with the peanut butter you can also use chocolate i use vanilla but if you put chocolate in there then i'll have a little bit of a chocolate flavor in there too you could even put chocolate chips in this to make it even more chocolatey to that mixture i put all this in one bowl we're going to put half a teaspoon of baking soda half a teaspoon of baking powder and then i sift all that together when i before i mix it in so i'll put it in the sifter and then you know put it into the into the mixing bowl and then mix it all together when you're done mixing it all together it'll have a very almost dry texture it'll stick together really really well it won't be liquidy at all and that is what you want okay so next we're going to mix it all together but those are the ingredients if you want a complete list it'll probably be in the video description as well okay first step for any baking process is to cream together the butter and the sugar so you just add them both at the same time or you can start by mixing up the sugar and like or mixing up the butter and adding the sugar to it i'm just going to put them both in there and then we will just turn on the mixer and let it do its thing i like to start at a pretty low speed and then speed it up not i've warmed that butter up just a little bit in the microwave when that's pretty goodly mixed i'll uh i'll go ahead and scrape the bowl one time just to make sure there's no just butter kind of sticking on something and uh we'll mix it just a little bit more and then the next thing we are going to add is the egg whites and the peanut butter all right let's add the egg whites this is a quarter cup we're adding a whole half cup of egg whites one and we're not gonna have quite enough luckily i have another carton here in case i run out now if you get towards the end and the mix is too dry just add more egg whites you can add more water if you want but why not add more protein is the way i look at it so i'll mix that in and then we will pour in the peanut butter as that is mixing okay once those are mixed it should have a consistency that's that's pretty much like peanut butter like it should just look like peanut butter at this point then we're gonna add the flour mixture and that's gonna basically dry it out and make it like a real cookie dough okay so one of the things we have to do here is actually sift the flour so i just take all that mixture of protein and the flour and the baking powder and the baking soda and i just put it in the sifter and sift it now you can sift it right into the dough this is the sifter that i like to use um you can sift it right into the dough but because i like to pour this in slowly so it gets kind of all mixed into that peanut butter mixture i like to sift it beforehand um there we go so once it's sifted then we can um put the paddle back on and mix it in all right time to pour in the flour make sure you lock your your stand mixer if you're using a stand mixer because this dough is going to get real thick as we go here foreign so and you want to uh go until the dough starts to pull off the sides if it's not pulling all the way off the sides you can go over one time with like a little spatula just to get all the the fat off of the side so that's what i'm going to do now real quick is just scrape the sides of the bowl into the middle make sure we're getting all the fat all the egg whites all the protein mixed in with the flour it should be not too wet it should be a pretty dry kind of cookie dough and if you get it to the right consistency you'll you'll feel it and uh you can taste this by the way because there's nothing i mean there's raw flour which you really shouldn't eat too much of but you can taste it the whole way and see if you like it my kids generally like the cookie dough part better than the cookie for some reason they just go they just like always wanted to taste the cookie dough and i gotta say cookie dough is pretty good you can see it's so thick that it's like making the the motor really work it's making the whole thing shake that's actually what you want you want it to be this really kind of thick dough it's just like like a play-doh texture almost that's what you want you want it to look like that before you cook it okay the next thing we're going to do is bake it at 325 but before we do that i'm going to take this and put it into some saran wrap and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes you can actually keep it in the fridge for you know a couple weeks or something or not a couple weeks but like a week you could freeze it and keep it in the freezer for like months but you keep it in the fridge for like a week until you want to bake them if you want fresh cookies or something or just bake them right away and put them in a bag when they're when they're cooked and eat one every once in a while so okay all we're going to do now is take the dough and put it in some saran wrap it should all come out as like a big chunk anything that's left over you can just kind of scrape out of there as you want um there might be a couple little things like left in the bowl but for the most part the the cookie dough should just fall out in like a big almost dry chunk again like a play-doh texture but it tastes really good like you can you can taste that right now if you want to and it it'll probably taste pretty good if you follow my recipe and you'll probably want to eat a cookie made out of this pretty soon so ah yum that's pretty good so just wrap that in the saran wrap and put it in the fridge for at least uh 15-20 minutes now this step is actually not mandatory at all you can leave it outside the fridge if you want to or just put this right in the oven like this but i find if you put it in the fridge it makes it easier to roll it into little balls which is what we're going to do for the next part here i like to roll them into little balls before we cook them here we go we just put that in the fridge for a while all right it's time to bake our cookies i'm actually refrigerated the dough a whole day because i didn't have time to bake them yesterday so we have a refrigerated dough we're going to need some cooking spray i'll show you what we're going to do with this we're actually not going to grease the cookie sheet rather we're going to grease our fork to make it easier to make those little indentations that you normally get with peanut butter cookies so we're going to roll those into balls and try to put six on each sheet they'll be pretty big and that'll make 150 calorie cookie okay so you want a pretty good chunk and then you can just kind of smush it into a big ball here i'm gonna roll it and uh nice big balls which you want about an inch and a half we're gonna make about a dozen cookies so we're gonna make 12 of those i like to use a silicone baking mat just makes it easy to pull the cookies off easy for clean up not necessary can cook on a regular sheet and these are insulated baking sheets by the way not necessary but i like the cookie do not have that crust on the bottom and that will make them not have any of that kind of crunchy crust on the bottom of the cookie so as you see i'm making we're just gonna end up with about 12 balls now i refrigerate the dough partly because it's easier to make these little balls out of them but also because if you refrigerate the dough it will make sure the center of the cookie is a little bit softer because it takes longer to heat up the middle of the cookie so i like the texture of the cookies a little bit better if we do the refrigerated dough but that is not a necessary step you can go straight from the bowl onto the cookie sheet if you want to okay next thing we're going to do is make the little crisscross patterns in the cookies this is pretty easy you just do it with a fork because these are so big i'm actually going to smush these down just a little bit before i actually put in the little crisscross patterns because otherwise it's going to be it's going to kind of pull the cookie apart a little bit and it probably still will now one thing i like to do with this is i actually like to grease the fork by with just a little cooking spray and that'll make sure that it doesn't stick to that sticky peanut butter dough so you got it greased a little bit and then we just go one way mush it down and then go the other way and with that grease it just doesn't stick and it's okay if it doesn't come out as like a big flat cookie remember it's going to spread out a little bit as we go into the oven so that's how you make that crisscross mark in your peanut butter cookies and if you notice it starts to stick again just a little bit more cooking spray and you are good to go to continue making these nice big grandiose 150 calorie peanut butter cookies all right there we go some big thick peanut butter cookies these are ready to go in the oven at 325 degrees for about 15 minutes okay so there they are in the oven notice i have them roughly towards the middle of the oven all right so here are the cookies all nice and baked with just the edges becoming a little bit dark that's how you want them they'll still be gooey in the center these are going to be super soft when you take them out of the oven so you got to let them sit and cool for a while and they will firm up and then you can eat them now these are 12 150 calories each if you wanted 100 calorie cookies just make 18 out of the same amount of dough and then you have 100 calories snack instead so that's it", "ekwvBj_NznM": "so what are you doing today Don must really be having a sweet tooth freak he's asking me to make a video on how I make peanut butter cookies that you can have so I think cookies I just want cookies so I figured I would make them peanut butter cookies that are more diabetic friendly for him you use a one cup of peanut butter a teaspoon of most people use vanilla I use McGinnis creme de cocoa flavoring half a cup of brown sugar except I use brown sugar Splenda and I'm going to differ from my recipe today and add a boat I think it's about a half a cup of ground up almonds the man I saw doing low-carb peanut butter cookies said that they kept them from going brittle one egg and here's my grapeseed oil in a beer bottle for greasing the pan that's the ingredients what tools do you need you need a bowl and a spoon I'm also using a spatula to get the peanut butter out you can use creamy peanut butter you can use chunky peanut butter it is entirely up to you you could use natural peanut butter with no salt you can use I don't know if they make peanut butter without sugar but you could probably use that as well I'm not that keen on making peanut butter cookies because I hate the smell of the peanut butter little overpowering well a friend of mine who showed me the recipe in the first place she puts mini miniature chocolate chips in her lip she can you get diabetic chocolate chips no but the ones she puts in are so small I don't think they would even notice I don't think it works you don't even notice it but you could put peanut you can put coconut unsweetened coconut into it so that year one cup of peanut butter then you add the almond flour if you feel like it it'll add a bit of texture to it the only people have ever really had in my kitchen while I cook was my younger children it calls for half a cup of peanut butter I usually add a little bit less than that um don't you mean brown sugar what did I say peanut butter falls for half a cup of brown sugar I usually add a bit less I'd say I add about a quarter of a cup part of my disability is that my hands shake rather bad it's about a quarter cup don't let my cameraman know this but one time I forgot the brown sugar is higher early and he never noticed so it's pretty much whatever you feel like putting in in other words sweeten to taste yeah it's a very forgiving recipe that's my oven saying it's preheated to 350 I'm gonna add a tablespoon of the cr\u00e8me de coco oh so I can get drunk no ah the alcohol boils off or baked salt I guess but it seems to be perfectly harmless because I put it into pancake syrup on my grandchildren lol okay now we just mixed it up and no I didn't forget the flowers there is none in it there that's what it looks like when it's mixed kick the ball a little this way okay that's it open your coil put a little baking sheet paper towel or your fingers spread it you don't need a whole lot of oil because the peanuts are peanut butter is rather oily too so oil this one because it's been over campfires on camp stoves it's end of work done in shape so just to be on the safe side I usually oil it so I can get like your beer bubble has it's been a resealable lid it's got a plastic part to stick in pull it forward open it just pop it off I just dropped the cookies on I guess they're owed walnut-sized your ramen okay I've got 23 cookies that melon that batter mix you don't have to flatten them at all you can if you want to if you felt like doing that you could use a fork you've dipped the fork into the flour and flatten it or you could take the bottom of a spoon above a glass and use that my mother learned from the baker in town and she used one of the potato masters with the square pieces in it and you've got square a square grid going across the cookies but this way is perfectly fine I'm going to put them in at a 350 degree oven and I'll start checking them after 10 minutes they usually take 10 to 12 so here they go into the other and we just went off what was that the timer just went off and the cookies you can take them off and put them on a cooling rack but it's not really necessary I do sometimes sometimes I don't cookies it's no good we do so you're gonna have to make some more tomorrow after a you come all to me no no no dear this is some you said you're taking me to the city for Valentine's Day yes so how can I possibly be making you cookies we have a long drive well I guess we can come home early since Monday is family day and you're off maybe we can make up some mince meat tarts for you okay isn't it wonderful how big boys turn into such little boys when there's sweets around to be nice I am I could have called you a little tip spoiled little brat no no but anyway that is how I make they're not diabetic cookies but they're cookies that a lot of diabetics can have because there is no flour so that cuts way down on the carbs they're also very simple to make yes quick so before my cameraman starts drooling all over the screen I'd better say so long and let him have one", "xCBGRE6Ih04": "[Music] welcome to another episode of assembly Sara today my shadow we're gonna make easy peanut butter cookies these have no flour in them that's why they're easy two cups of peanut butter and I'm using sugar-free peanut butter creamy or you can do the crunchy it's up to you two and 2/3 cup of Splenda or any other sweetener you want to use 2 eggs 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract make sure it's sugar-free a dash of salt because my Peter Byrne is not sold and the salt since my peanut butter was a soda so in baking Seth brings out the sweetness and then instead of and you just gonna mix it together that's it so simple you don't need to make sure but even use mixer if you want to make sure you get the south of the bowls and make sure you don't see no more of the white from the Splenda sugar and then here is your peanut butter dough I've got my oven preheated to 350 degrees I've got a baking sheet mine with myself at or you do parchment you might have to spray your parchment a little bit you do them just like you do regular you're gonna take a little scoop roll it on a bowl about the size of a walnut roll on your hands [Music] and I'm just gonna keep doing that until I've got all the peanut butter dog rub into bones all right I got a peanut butter cookie from now you won't come with a little bit extra of Splenda in a bowl with the court just like you do Omega peanut butter cookies you come down dip again like a crisscross and to them now this is optional you don't have to do this you can just mash them down with a little bit of your palm I want and not have the crisscross mark on the top but to me the traditional peanut cookies that I grew up with a that's the crisscross okay now they're going to go into the oven for about 8 to 12 minutes I'm gonna start at 8 and then I'll watch them our

Get it, Peanut Mutter Butter? Ooh! - Yeah, they were like Mom, we want you to cook, you gotta learn. - Yeah, so you can't cook, right? - Um, eeh. - It's gonna be a lot of fun, we've done this a million times, and so you get to be apart of this recipe. And, everyone at home, you get\nto be apart of this recipe, so we can involve them. - [Rebecca] Yeah! - However they like, they can\ngive tips to you on baking. - Yeah, I need a lot of tips, and can we just note the\ntwo dogs hugging each other. - Just holding on for dear\nlife, just praying for cookies. - Yeah, okay you guys\n- Yeah, alright. - are gonna go down right now, because I need to learn how to cook. - [Rocky] Yes! - [Rebecca] Some dog treats. - I use wholewheat flour. - I like a good wholewheat. - Yeah. We have baking soda and\npowder, unsweetened applesauce, so that there's no added\nsugar or anything like that, - Oh, that's true! - Yep. - It is the new year, new\nyou, you gotta slim up. - New year, new you, yeah,\npeanut, you listening to this? - Yeah. - We have all natural peanut butter. I like to use Dogsbutter, and\nthen we have clover honey. So now you wanna walk me through all this? Nah, I'm kidding. First, we wanna do a process where we simply mix the dry ingredients together. - Okay. - So why don't you grab\nthe baking soda there. - Awesome. - And I'll put the baking powder in there. - [Rebecca] I can do this! - [Rocky] Good, first step down! - This is easier than I thought. - Nailed it! (laughs) Alright, why don't you whisk that for me? - I will have to say when I met Rocky, and he started DOG for DOG,\nhe was working in a garage. - [Rocky] Yes. - So now to see him have a\ncompany, be making things. - Yeah. - And like donating things\nand doing such great work. You have a T.V. show, you have this. - Yes. - And now I'm on his cooking show. (laughs) It's just, it's full circle now. - I think when we come out of all of this, I'll have all of that success, but the ultimate measure of success will be the fact that\nyou're baking dog cookies. - I'm gonna go eat it in a\ngarage just for old times sake. - Okay, so it looks like we're gonna need some distracting with these\ntwo, so I got an idea. - Okay. - Why don't we do this, so you. - Oh! - Distract them with some of the ingredients there, the peanut butter. - Okay! - And I will finish\nmixing the ingredients, while you distract them, ready? - Okay, let's do it. - Okay, so why don't you\nstick your hand in there. - Okay. - And knead all that. It's gonna be a little sticky,\nbut don't worry about that. - Okay. - You know, you gotta get in the kitchen and get the job done. - Oh yeah. - Blackjack's like, let\nme help you out there.

What I always say with the oven is you know your oven, right? So if it cooks hot, maybe\npull that temperature back a little bit and vice versa. - [Rebecca] Okay. - Do you know your oven? - Well my oven is not used very often, but I'm sure I could figure it out. - Yeah, you could ask somebody. - I could ask somebody. - Like the previous person\nthat lived in that house. - Yeah, exactly. (laughs) It'd be really simple to find out. - I'll throw those in the oven. - Do it! (upbeat music) (oven bings) - I would say this is a hit. - [Rebecca] Okay, well I\nguess he likes the big cookie.

coats to quick easy free ingredient peanut butter biscuit recipe today I've seen lot done with using cookies and adding the egg and milk and chuckling in the oven that's all stuff this is different so just so you know that I would either cook the biscuits going to be free ingredient the choice to put a topping on is up to you okay so let's get started won't be long so we do you blitz you digestives in the food processor stick them into a bowl add your melted butter give it a good mix all your thinking then nobody's doing this changing digestives having peanut butter and bar and put it in the fridge yes exactly what I'm doing but if you've got children and so forth this is goods quick it's easy and to be honest it makes digestives a bit more interesting so once all the buzz mixed in and two or three good dollops of peanut butter depends how much like peanut butter not peanut butter we all peanut by fans in our ass Riaan should do it away while I wait now just mix all together this keep mixing to this all mixed together you can see you can melt the peanut butter and then add it on but it depends up to you really don't take long to come together there you go it's all come together to form short one so I've got a line try it it's not stick anyway but it's just if you take it out as a whole it's nice to put paper in that way if you can just lift it out I'm not sure warming to do once it's in so okay just range the tray round tray doesn't matter whatever you can have wherever you can find in the house makes 4 400 grams of biscuits I'll use there so spread the biscuit mix around she put it evenly in the image spread once it's even start to pack it down it's important bit now so no cooking involved easy as you like and they taste great okay that's it put them in the fridge for an hour and take them out and see what we got okay that's been in the fridge off our 45 minutes okay so you can take out and you can cut it now and your biscuits fine music warm knife and as you see we cut my problem and you can just have them in squares triangles whatever you want so what I'm gonna do is you can add something on top people put my tailor and stuff on top of their biscuits so I'm gonna do I'm going to do some with nothing on top and some with a bit of chocolate on top so I've done is I've melted some milk chocolate with a little bit of cream just so it doesn't sit off too hard and I'm gonna put that on top of there but we'll put it back in the tray first hmm don't spread that chocolate over put it back in the fridge to let it set if you just drop gonna start flattening out and you first okay I'll put them back in to sit off and we'll cut them up as well mm-hmm okey-dokey there you go I'm about a cookie with chocolate long pin about cookie don't have to add chocolate if you do it about chocolate you might wanna add sugar to the digest image but I didn't because I quite like the taste how it is I finished fine as is and if you put chocolate on it adds a sweetness but you don't have pataga you putting the tail or stuff like that on top okay I take some photos thank you for watching and I'll catch you next time [Music]", "mfjZurho5rU": "nars that's fashion we design this with passion nora snaps fast today i'm surprisingly norris knight and the nurse i'm surprisingly is and since biggie loves peanut butter i'm making peanut butter stuffed cookies i made a big list of what i had to do to make these peanut butter stuffed cookies but i forgot to bring the list so i very kindly like stocky to go back to the other house and get it for me not me i cannot get my things out the australian recipe is 201 grams of peanut butter i don't exactly know how to control this but uh i think you just pressed up congrats on me you're not hanging on [Music] here is like taking so long just to get like these 300 and you're allowed like the spoons [Music] if no one ever wins filmed you're technically white people need 302 grams of powdered sugar [Music] oh yeah that looks so good why is this so crumbly meant to be like harder we've not added enough peanut butter oh my god i don't even know is it meant to look this crumbly so i used this peanut butter when i was meant to use this peanut butter please don't make the same mistake as me this is so hard [Music] oh stein tastes more peanut buttery actually see that's what taste this is good but then it's all crumbly at the bottom okay you're allowed lucky fingers let's count to nine one two three four five six seven eight nine six and wash your fingers peanut butter is actually annoying to cook with i'm not cooking with him again now i'm shaping these all into like little balls and then i'm gonna put them in the freezer this is gonna be a fun video i'm not gonna let the peanut butter and the powdered sugar going wrong dim my spirits and i can't wait to see biggie's reaction to these he's honestly just gonna freak out about it this is the peanut butter feeling so i'm gonna pop these in the freezer [Music] add my peanut butter first i think we can all disagree i'm slow cook i think that's just how i'm gonna be i don't think i'm a fast cook it took me like an hour and a half to make fairy bread i don't like cooking with peanut butter or nutella and i do not like washing the dishes for peanut butter or nutella but i do like eating peanut butter or nutella well i don't really like nutella actually i can't wait to wipe all the peanut butter down that's going to be so fun no but i've been trying as hard as i can to resist the peanut butter 250 grams of normal sugar [Music] look how good [Music] this is looking this is your fast forward it's it doesn't taste like cookie dough i basically just sort of add everything now [Music] pretty simple i am going to get another bowl though 302 grams of brown sugar it says i need a big egg but i'm just adding a normal egg i need three grams of salt one two three four this is looking like amazing oh i wanted to add a little bit of vanilla sugar i need one teaspoon of vanilla extract i think it was a tablespoon no taste looks a little bit watery now that i have a tablespoon and half a teaspoon of baking soda aye aye why do i say i ain't to myself you meant to have um what is it called all all-purpose flour but there was none where i am so i just have um what flower do i actually have self raising flour now i need soft butter and i'm not gonna chuck it out because that's wrong oh wait i'm surprising video i shouldn't be talking about vicky like that honestly his reaction's gonna be priceless should i check out the butter to honor a biggie i feel like that's wrong i don't want to do that i'm not gonna put this in the bin i'm just gonna pretend i am so picky here you go biggie i'm putting the butter in the bin do me proudness a young cheeto okay stay safe in the fridge butter i feel like i can make an official statement i'm a bad cook if i never learn how to be a good cook maybe i should just like never have kids or just like never cook for my kids and i'm just going to leave it there i'm going to pray that biggie will like this he should okay i'm taking these out of the fridge cookie dough doesn't feel like cookie dough if it's like so wet i'm gonna begin to shave my balls and no i need to be happy okay it's time to begin shaving my paws like look i'm so bummed about how bad my cookies are but to make me happy i just have to think of how big his reaction is gonna be when he sees these cookies i wonder how long these took me to make i would say they probably took me an hour and they were meant to be half an hour recipe but look that's pretty good now let's put these bad boys in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes someone help me put these in the oven can you get soggy could you humble these in the oven they're not preheated the others are on if you do that you can have try the cookie dough okay let me guess this is my peanut butter and icing sugar yes and

you should definitely make this and since these are stuff now i want to show you the inside you", "ugzfsJUJgYE": "[Music] hey what's up it's Vince Lear for Vince Lia calm and I don't know what it is recently but it seems like a lot of the recipes I've been doing are very nostalgic and bring me back to my childhood we did some chocolate pudding we did some french toast and looking to continue with that theme today because we're gonna be knocking out some of three ingredients peanut butter cookies what I really like about this recipe is that these peanut butter cookies are so easy to make they're vegan they're gluten free and there's only three ingredients and we know one of the ingredients is peanut butter which means there's only two mystery ingredients and they also have that little hashtag indentation in maple pork so we all know these are legit peanut butter cookies for this recipe you will need 3/4 cups of peanut butter if you buy peanut butter with the oil on top make sure you stir it up really well so it's nice and creamy the swing up these cookies we are going to be using four and a half tablespoons of Lepanto maple syrup now the reason that I really like LeConte oh is that it's made out of monk fruit it is a zero glycemic and zero calorie sweetener that's gonna make these cookies taste delicious our last ingredient is three tablespoons of Arrowhead Mills coconut flour now coconut flour is gluten free and high in fiber I'll put a link to both the coconut flour and the Lepanto in the description box below so you can check them out our first step is a place of all those ingredients into a food processor and mix them together to create our peanut butter cookie batter but before we do that go ahead and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees because this isn't gonna take very long and you don't want to be waiting around for the oven to preheat because you just want to eat some cookies [Applause] [Music] [Applause] after everything is mixed together we're left with this peanut butter a cookie dough and we're simply gonna take this dough roll it into small balls placed it on a lined baking sheet then take our fork and do that peanut butter hashtag mark on each one and then place it in the oven for about 12 minutes [Music] so after about 12 minutes in the oven and a few minutes to pull down we are left with 12 vegan and gluten-free peanut butter cookies let's go ahead and try them and see how they taste these cookies are so delicious so chewy soap peanut buttery but one thing I did forget to mention is if you're using peanut butter that already has sugar in it you may want to adjust the amount of syrup you used so the cookies aren't too sweet but if you like peanut butter you're gonna like these cookie so I hope you enjoyed this 3 ingredient peanut butter vegan and gluten-free cookie recipe if you liked this video give it a big thumbs up leave me a comment let me know if you like peanut butter cookies or what your favorite cookie is subscribe to the channel as I post new videos every week and remember to keep living fit from food and I'll talk to you soon bye [Music]", "WPh3e-hjdww": "[Music] [Music] dogs let us pray church of cult that there are no more unnecessary interruptions in this filming process hey it's liv with snh in the kitchen welcome back i'm making for you today a decadently delicious brown butter peanut butter toffee cookie now i'm sure you've made tons of cookies in your day and in fact i have too but what sets this one apart from me is that beautiful marriage of a wonderfully chewy cookie lots of yummy texture and of course all that ooey gooey peanut butter chocolatey toffee goodness now that's a mouthful girl let's get started you're going to take a stick of butter turn your saucepan on low butter browns really quickly so this is not one of those things that you're going to run away from go do a load of dishes or anything along those lines you need to stay put and keep an eye on it so that way you don't take it too far what i love about this recipe is that it's all pantry ingredients it's a really straightforward cookie recipe and you really can't go wrong now that our butter is brown and cooling let's get started on the rest of our dough what you'll need is one cup all-purpose flour half a cup of granulated sugar one half teaspoon vanilla bean paste a half a cup of chucky peanut butter half teaspoon salt a half teaspoon baking soda one large egg half a cup of chocolate wafers and two toffee style candy bars so now that we've added our butter and sugar into our mixing bowl we're gonna go ahead and beat this with an electric mixer peanut butter cookies are near and dear to my heart when i was little my grandmother who was not a baker this was the one recipe she knew not this specific variation but peanut butter cookies my grandmother came here from the dominican republic and all she knew was dominican food her assimilating to american style cuisine was definitely an adventure when i was younger i mean we had a whole host of new dominican inspired american dishes but the one goes here that she always made for peanut butter cookies in fact she lost her recipe years and years ago and i went on the hunt to find the recipe and replicate it just for her so she could give it to her great grandkids the funny thing is that this recipe is literally betty powder so now that we've incorporated our butter and sugar together we're gonna go ahead and add in the rest of our wet ingredients we'll be adding in our peanut butter our egg as well as our vanilla bean case let's add in our flour mixture [Music] so when i see that most if not all of my flour is incorporated into my batter i stop my electric mixer nobody wants a tough cookie and that's what you're going to get if you overbeat it we're going to finish incorporating the rest of our ingredients by hand so now that we've finished incorporating all of our chocolate and hockey bits we're going to actually let this hang out and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes you want to rest your dough and give it time so that way one your flour can properly hydrate and two so that way your butter can harden up enough that it's not going to fall apart and spread into a gooey mess when you're baking it so we're gonna grab some cling film wrap this guy up and pop her in the fridge for the next 30 minutes so our cookie dough has been resting for a half hour and now it is ready for us to go ahead and get baking i've already started preheating my oven to 350 degrees you should say get ready for this to happen it smells so good already in my kitchen it smells like a butter flavor all right let's get to scooping so be sure to use a rimmed baking sheet and either line it with parchment paper or silk hat i just have a little hat here so the dough is a little bit crumblier than your standard cookie dough i would just press it in a little bit into your scoop just so that way you have a nice a nice piece of bubble ones that comes out of your cookie scoop this recipe yields about 18 cookies depending on the size of scoop you're using and you'll only really want to do five to your cookie now before you get to baking we have a couple of more steps one of which is optional you're gonna go ahead and use the heel of your hand and you're just gonna press your cookie down into a bit of a disk so it's just a little bit flattened and even surface and then after you're done pressing you can either top your cookies with a little bit of flaky sea salt or fluorocell optional of course i just like that this extra bit of salt just brings out all of the sweet and savory flavors of your cookies now this is where you don't scrimp on the salt use a really good quality sea salt let's go ahead and make our cookies i just pop them in on the middle rack and i'm setting my timer for five minutes and you're gonna bake the cookies for about 10 to 12 minutes depending on how chewy you want your cookie now at about five minutes in you're gonna pull them from the oven and i'm gonna show you why our timer testing let's check our cookies the reason why we check our cookies five minutes in and pull them from the oven is because we're gonna bang them out we do this so that way we have a nice even spread and we have a wonderfully chewy texture on the inside and a nice firm texture on the outside the perfect chewy cookie in my opinion already our cookies are out of the oven and they smell phenomenal so what you're going to want to do is go ahead and transfer these bad boys to a cooling rack just so that way they can cool properly try not to tuck into them i mean nothing's better than a warm cookie but let them cool down so the molten chocolate sugar toffee situation doesn't burn the roof of your mouth let's give these cookies a try what i love about this is you can see all of the crackly bits which is fantastic and you have all of this extra yumminess from the toffee pieces i haven't even properly eaten a cookie yet and i'm already mmm me these are so good vaguely reminiscent of grandma pia's cookies but just updated and elevated if you like this video or want to see more

butter and butterscotch filling to start off this recipe we are going to combine one cup of butterscotch chips with a quarter cup of peanut butter and then we're going to microwave it for a minute and then just stir it together until it's really smooth you know you have the right consistency when the butterscotch and peanut butter mixture just kind of drips off your spoon and is super super smooth and creamy go ahead and refrigerate that for approximately 15 to 20 minutes until it hardens up then take about a tablespoon of the peanut butter butterscotch mixture roll it into a ball and then place it onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper now we're going to move on to the peanut butter cookie dough so in order to make this cookie dough we're going to combine butter peanut butter and brown sugar blend those ingredients together and so smooth and creamy then go ahead and add in one egg and some vanilla extract blend those ingredients together and then we're going to add in our dry ingredients and this includes our flour baking soda and salt you can stop mixing once the dough starts to come together and now we can scoop about two tablespoons of our peanut butter cookie dough flatten it out and then add in a butterscotch peanut butter filling that we made earlier and then just kind of wrap the peanut butter cookie dough around it and then flatten out the top of the cookie dough with the palm of your hand and then just go ahead and bake those cookies off and then you can enjoy them while they're still warm to get that kind of oozy filling or if you want to save it for later you can always microwave it for five to ten seconds before it money well that's it for this week's video I hope you guys enjoyed it and if you do make sure to give this video a big thumbs up", "9NSHdXhPWLQ": "hey guys it's andrew and this is why we're fat so it's sunday which means it's time to make some sweets for lunches this week um and today we're making my salted peanut butter cookies so the cookie recipe itself is pretty standard with a piece a couple things of dress up so we've got a cup of softened butter put it in there make as much choice as possible cup of packed brown sugar and a cup of white granulated sugar we're gonna turn this on first let it get started then we've got two cups of creamy peanut butter um i've been asked in the past if i can if you can substitute crunchy peanut butter i think you can but i don't like the way what it does to the texture for this particular cookie so i would just kind of caution you that the recipe is not written for crunchy um but you're welcome to give it a try and let me know how it turns out if you do here so we'll give it a mix make sure that it's all combined and before we start adding anything else we're going to scrape down the sides make sure that all that peanut butter is getting mixed into the butter and the sugar scrape the spatula super exciting right now one of the big additions and i use this in a few other recipes already is powdered peanut butter i use the pb2 brand because it's just what i like but there are other brands available now you're gonna put this in here let it incorporate and then i've got two large eggs that i've cracked into a bowl to make sure i don't get any shells in because i will admit that i am notorious for that sometimes with baking that can go in get those eggs fully incorporated again scrape down the sides the last thing is two teaspoons of vanilla um for my vanilla i have taken to using this vanilla bean paste that comes with seeds i really like it i like the fact that it has the seeds in it so when you're making things like white cakes and vanilla ice cream you can see this flecks of seeds and it's easier to obviously store than the vanilla pods themselves but you still get that kind of soup vanilla pod kind of fresh vanilla flavor with it so let this mix for a second in the bowl here i've got our flour baking soda baking powder um cornstarch which is an interesting addition to this one that i love that i think is necessary um as well as our kind of the first bit of salt that we're adding we'll be adding some more in a few minutes you'll see we're going to put the mixer on low though and we're going to scoop in one spoon of the flour mixture at a time let it mix start to get incorporated fun and exciting but all in all you can see with these cookies you can throw them together pretty quick um it probably took me an extra five or six minutes to get the ingredients ready for kind of to demo rest the flour in there make sure that it mix up nice and good you'll know it's ready when it starts to pull away from the sides and the bowl cleans itself up a little bit stop it just like we've been doing give the bottom one last scrape make sure you've got all that flour and sugar and butter and all that goodness mixed in it smells super good really peanut buttery um and then we're gonna make little balls and roll them in some sugar we've got some granulated sugar and we've got large flake salt so i use kind of a smaller cookie um so they pack easier for lunches but you can make these as big as you want um if the bigger you get make sure that you swish them down enough though so we're gonna take a ball of dough we're gonna roll it into a little ball we're gonna roll it in the sugar i've got a parchment lined cookie sheet here take a fork and you're going to press down and press down to make the traditional peanut butter hash marks and you're going to take a small pinch of flank salt and put it on top we're going to go through and make these cookies get them all trade up and bake they bake at 350 for about 11 ish minutes um you want the bottoms to just start turning golden brown um pull them out and then i let them cool completely on the hot cookie sheets um so baking them does take time if you only have a couple of cookie sheets i i fortunately have been collecting cookie sheets so i've got a lot um but cooling them on the cookie sheet i think is really important because it helps kind of set the cookie before you move it onto a cookie rack to kind of put away or put in your cookie jar or pepper but we'll come back in a little bit and we'll finish up the cookies we'll show you what they look like give them a taste and go from there remember like our videos um subscribe to our youtube channel follow us

welcome to bead batter bait with me a partner I'm sure all of us have dug into a jar of peanut butter and licked away but today we are going to put that same peanut butter into our cookies and enjoy with a cup of coffee so let's see how to make peanut butter cookie for this recipe you will need 80 grams of softened butter I am using salted butter here but if you are using unsalted butter then add 1/4 teaspoon of salt to it to this I am going to add 1/2 cup of 125 grams of peanut butter the peanut butter that I am using has sugar added to it but if you are using unsweetened peanut butter then you can increase the brown sugar content to 1/2 cup or 100 grams to this I am going to add 1/2 cup of 100 grams of caster sugar 75 grams a 1/3 cup of brown sugar if you don't have brown sugar then please feel free to use same amount of caster sugar we are going to beat all of this together [Music] don't forget to scrape the sides of the bowl [Music] once a mixture becomes slightly pale in color that means it's done now moving on to our dry ingredients here I have 165 grams a1 plus 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour or maida to that I am going to add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda mix this well now all we have to do is mix our dry ingredients into a butter and sugar mixture to this I am going to add 2 tablespoons of chocolate chips but this is completely optional the dough needs to be quite soft but if it is dry then you can add 2 tablespoons of milk to it once your dough is ready we have to chill it in the fridge for around 15 to 20 minutes once the cookie dough has chilled it's time to roll them I am using 1 tablespoon of cookie dough per cookie [Music] roll it between your palms and place them on a very lightly greased cookie sheet roll rest of the dough in the same way keep some distance between the two cookies because they will rise as they bake you will get two dozen cookies from this recipe but you can easily half or double this recipe as per your requirement I am going to make a design on these cookies with a fork press it down one way and then the other if your cookie cracks from the side just pinch it back together [Music] we have to bake these in a preheated oven at 180 degrees for around 14 to 15 minutes our cookies are out of the oven and they took 15 minutes to bake if you want slightly crisper cookie you can bake them for another two minutes let them cool on the cookie sheet itself for another five to seven minutes so these cookies are another yummy way to satisfy your peanut butter craving do try this recipe at home

chocolate so i know this is christina's vlog but i'm guest starring right now because she's having technical difficulties over there so she uh just cooked the other half of the sausage balls because uh it was gonna take two batches and they're a lot better or warm so we should cook them today don't you turn the frown upside down starting your vlog for you well thank you oh hey basil's doing better we cook these for three minutes less here they actually look better at 22 minutes and i'll tell you what really looks is because the cheese although it is that sort of like drip down and burnt cheese type of thing it's not as uh done so i think that maybe but who knows we'll find out look at this oh okay you see what i mean it's not like all the way burnt it's just like down there melted or whatever what they know about french french style service i could i could split a salad for two people with that wow fancy i love your technique you don't need tongs all you need is a couple of spoons

cheap ass chocolate they don't taste that good [Laughter] you saw the sausage balls yesterday um so no cooking today we're gonna do baking i decided to make some peanut butter cookies today i was looking for a recipe because i've made peanut butter cookies in the past and they've always been kind of like dry and maybe a little gritty even and then you know doing some more research it says instead of just using um white sugar use brown sugar and white sugar combined and it'll be more moist and also to melt the butter i've never i've always just um i've always just creamed the butter with the sugars and i guess i was incorporating air into the batter so that's why my cookies would always be like fluffy and cake like so i felt like i think uh peanut butter i want the texture to be the texture to be more chewy so i'm gonna try melted butter for the first time making cookies uh so i'm gonna melt the butter it says like don't boil it just melt it very slowly about 80 and the rest will just melt naturally with the residual heat i guess so i'm going to put this in the microwave melt that and it also the recipe also stated don't use a hand mixer so uh i love my hand mixer and i was like oh gosh but it's not gonna be that too bad um doing it with a whisk because the butter is gonna be melted i don't have to be creamy in the butter so yeah let's try a new recipe and see how these peanut butter cookies come out see how i didn't melt it all the way i just actually um since the butter was room temperature i put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and [Music] now the rest of it just kind of melts on its own it just said don't over heat it [Music] um [Music] christmas time [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] uh [Music] who said you can't have a nice relaxing work environment i should get like some christmas smelly ones maybe some pine or cinnamon scent or something i don't know okay i'm gonna get to work on these boxes [Music] okay as i started um packing up all these boxes i just got another order in thank you very much you guys are so sweet and so awesome thank you [Music] [Music] okay well i'm gonna get these in the oven and my taste tester should be home my taste tester should be home any minute [Music] [Music] so last night it got really late and i got tired so um it's the next morning i decided to wake up bake the cookies now uh this is only about 40 of the dough um the rest of the dough could stay in the frigerator for up to three days so i'm just gonna bake this batch now and bake the rest later [Music] i also decided to use raw sugar instead of white sugar because it's raw sugar it just has more of a like a molasses taste so i'm gonna that's my twist on these cookies [Music] this is [Music] ages [Music] ready cookie taster what why don't you say guinea pig tell the truth you know what though i don't mind being the guinea pig oh oh look at the bottom perfectly brown worried a little that you didn't cook them long enough you gave them an extra one minute oh very thought oh wow they're very soft they're supposed to be did you tell them that yeah i looked up a soft or i looked up soft and chewy recipe what do you think the true test will be when they cool do they have good peanut butter yeah and i also use natural peanut butter you know just pure peanuts that's it and a lot of people say that when you use that that they don't come out as moist as when you use like gif or skippy yeah because you have a bunch of extra hydrogenated trans fat the middle tastes almost like pure peanut butter there was another suggestion too to a small one to drizzle chocolate on them did you forget we have this chocolate sauce kind of that's for the what we use for the this is uh what's the name of this tarani or what yeah we were using it for coffees all right i'm gonna give you the real deal you ready oh gosh it's not my third cookie is it i think it's only your second it's my third does it taste good with chocolate yeah then maybe i should melt some uh use this seems weird putting syrup on the cookie it's not syrup it's sauce i'm glad you like them eat that one oh you want to try it with a here you gonna taste from behind the camera go ahead try that that straight cookie right there very peanut buttery i know i told you i like that raw sugar we shouldn't be eating cookies while we're hungry cookies for breakfast yeah cause i'm gonna eat seven of these i know and my coffee's cold now try this the whole bite one bite everybody knows the rules hmm maybe better you're yeah i know you're tr you're trying not to like it she's trying to not like it so she can be like but it tastes pretty amazing and what and what are we going to waste this stuff that's pretty good i told you i'm drizzling all of them here we go i recommend this peanut butter recipe see you next time bye everyone oh", "zSove8JBTc4": "[Music] okay people where are my peanut butter lovers i know you're out there and i can see you so today we're making something super special just for you hi i'm carolyn from all day i dream about food and today we're making easy keto peanut butter bars these bars are the perfect dessert for die hard peanut butter lovers they're super easy to make they don't require any baking and my kids swear they taste just like reese's peanut butter cups so the first thing we're gonna do is take our baking pan a square baking pan you can use nine by nine or eight by eight this one happens to be nine by nine and we're going to line that with either wax paper or parchment paper so our bars don't stick so here i have three quarters cup of butter and i'm going to add three quarters cup of peanut butter and this one is all natural no added sugars and i'm going to show you a little trick for measuring out peanut butter i have my three-quarter cup measure here and i'm going to spray it with a little avocado oil it doesn't really matter what you spray it with and just wipe that around a little and this way the peanut butter will come much more easily out of my measuring cup so i'm just going to scoop my peanut butter into my measuring cup and pack it down as much as i can so i get the full three-quarters cup now we need to melt these together i like to just do it in my microwave but if you don't have a microwave you can always just do it in a pan on the stovetop okay so now my peanut butter and butter are nicely melted together and i'm just going to whisk them up and then i'm going to add my sweetener because this is a no-bake recipe i recommend powdered sweetener and i have half a cup of powdered swerve here and we whisk that in until it's smooth and then we're going to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and because my peanut butter was unsalted i like to add just a little salt and now for the magic ingredients i am using peanut flour this one is from anthony's it's roasted and it's partially defatted so it's very powdery and fine a lot of people ask me if you can make this recipe with other flowers like almond flour and you can but almond flour has a lot more moisture in it and so you're going to end up adding a whole lot more than than the peanut flour which can raise the carb count but for today we're using the peanut flour and i have two cups of it here and i'm using a rubber spatula to stir it because you're going to find that it thickens a lot and you really need to work that peanut flour into the mixture so after you've worked in the peanut flour you're going to find that it kind of starts to come together and hold together and it's going to be like one big ball of dough if it doesn't do that you want to add a little more peanut flour at a time until it looks like this then we're going to take our baking pan that we lined with wax paper and we're just going to transfer this big ball of dough into that and we're going to use our hands at first to start pressing it out into the pan and once it's looking pretty even it's still going to have your finger imprints on it so if you really want to smooth it out you take another piece of wax paper or parchment paper put it on top and then take a flat bottomed glass or measuring cup and you can just use that to make it all nice and even and then once they're all smoothed out to your satisfaction you're going to stick them in the fridge to cool while you prepare the chocolate topping so i'm going to add first two tablespoons of butter and then i've got three ounces of lily's dark chocolate here you could use the chips if you prefer and i always just take the squares and break them up and then you just want to stir them until they're nice and melted and smooth and once your topping is nice and smooth and melted grab those bars out of the fridge and pour the chocolate over top and spread it to the edges i like this little offset spatula and make sure you're covering all of your yummy bars with some of the chocolate and i always like to take bars like this and kind of shake them after i've poured the chocolate on so that it evens out the topping now these need to go back in the fridge until the chocolate is completely set which takes about an hour and while you're waiting for those to cool you can always enjoy the chocolate that's left over on your spatula okay peanut butter lovers an hour is up and we are ready to cut into our bars the nice part about lining your pan with with wax paper is that you can just easily lift the whole thing out and it makes it much easier for cutting and i like to take my bench knife but you can use any sharp knife and cut in oh look at that nice and soft and perfect and there we go my friends easy keto no-bake peanut butter bars these are going to be a hit with your whole family for this easy keto recipe and so many more please check out [Music]

salt free peanut butter one teaspoon of vanilla and one tablespoon of cocoa powder now you want to mix this until it's smooth with no chunks that looks good enough now you want to put little blobs onto a baking tray that is lined with baking paper [Music] now you want to put this in the oven for about 15 to 12 minutes while your cookies are baking you want to make you nurture tella first you're going to add two cups of cashews to your blender two tablespoons of hazelnuts nine large medjool dates two teaspoons of vanilla four tablespoons of cocoa powder and about one cup of almond milk blend until smooth [Music] now that it's smooth we're going to put it into the bowl now that your cookies are done baking we let them cool for five to ten minutes and we're going to frost them I'm a this nutrit Ella recipe as an awesome like substitute for Nutella and everything because I just love and tell us so much and so this is really good and it satisfies any cravings [Music]", "Ahd_ZVEEOWM": "this is literally one of the easiest ways to make really filling delicious cookies and i call these my peanut butter cookies with chocolate but because peanuts are grain they're not paleo so we replace the peanut butter with almond butter and trust me after you've been doing it as long as i have you literally don't even think twice about the fact that it's almond butter and they taste just as good as peanut butter cookies and we're gonna melt delicious chocolate on them too all right so you see we're starting with an egg i always buy organic cage free eggs you can literally get this anywhere at any grocery store so that's the good news you don't have to go out of your way to get the eggs then we're gonna do the super fine almond flour i always do the bob's red mill because it's the closest you can get to organic without paying for the organic price and the almond flour you're doing that half a cup now here on the almond butter this is the 365 non-gmo again i do that because it's cheaper than the organic and that's a full cup of the almond butter next is the organic unrefined coconut sugar that is organic and it is unrefined and you're gonna do a half a cup of that and then lastly i melt paleo chocolate and pour it all over the piece i pour it all over the cookies because it's fun to pour chocolate all over cookies okay so all i did was mix up the ingredients now i'm going to spray the pan with organic olive oil i know it sounds stupid but you know if you use the other spray oils there's chemicals in them and if you're paleo you want to stick with the organic as much as you can so that's why you want to get the organic olive oil spray there's coconut sprays too so whatever you find that's organic in either olive oil or coconut you're good to go on that and while we're scooping out our cookies with our ice cream scooper i did want to thank you guys because the last video i was complaining that i was plateauing and i was trying to lose 10 pounds i plateaued for three months at 155 and multiple people told me to try fasting which i had done in the past and it worked but i hated it because i was struggling to get my calories in last time so this time around i was like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna get all my calories in and eat in an eight-hour window i'm gonna commit to it because if that's what it's gonna take for me to lose 10 more pounds and get to 145 then so be it so i've been doing it and i'm down two more pounds i lost two pounds in a week so now i'm down to 153 trying to get to 145 so i'm eight pounds shy of my goal right now so thank you thank you thank you guys if you have any more tips for losing the last eight pounds i would love to hear it because it's not going gonna be easy but you know if the fasting keeps working i will keep doing it i hate going to bed hungry but you gotta do what you gotta do to lose those last eight pounds right and i'll do whatever it takes if you tell me i have to drink five gallons of water i will drink five gallons of water okay after you put your cookies in the oven you do them 350 for 12 to 15 minutes depending on how soft you want them one pro tip use a fork to smoosh them down i forgot so i did it in the oven shoved my arm in the oven with the fork to do it because i forgot to do it before i put them in the oven so make sure you use your fork and flatten them down also another thing i want to mention if you want these super sweet i would swap out a half a cup of maple syrup for the coconut sugar because these are not super super sweet but because i'm drizzling the chocolate on top which also has the stevia in it i didn't feel like i needed to use maple syrup over the coconut sugar all right so this is the best part where you just see me drizzling that chocolate i go a little crazy here and i just covered them with chocolate i was like really really hungry when i made the video and again these are protein packed they have 15 grams of carbohydrates 10.5 grams of sugar 15 grams of fat 7 grams of protein and they're 206 calories each not counting the chocolate you're drizzling on top okay we're gonna take these melty gooey gooey organic paleo peanut butter in quotations because it's made with almond butter which is organic peanuts are not because peanuts are green i'm gonna get a big bite of this [Music] mm-hmm [Music] so um chocolaty peanut buttery sweet from the coconut sugar also if you want to make these low carb you can replace the organic unrefined coconut sugar with stevia and that's totally it's almost like completely carb free so good subscribe let's keep doing this baby", "qQ8jz_BRm64": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to my channel today I am making cookies that I think is the best recipe ever and they are the Reese's peanut butter

then after that it's mixed up really well [Music] and then after that's makes really good I'm gonna go ahead and add my flour with baking soda and my salt so next we're going to add in the M&Ms teresa's pieces and then Reese pops I got the miniature cups but I mean you can easily get the bigger ones if you want to they just said early good deal on them right now because it's Halloween so that's why I grabbed those and so the first thing you're going to do is you're gonna take all of your M&Ms and put those in here and I like to be the first because they're harder to punch up and the same thing so I'm at first and I just can eyeball it I'm gonna go nuts with this so no pun intended I do is I like to take like a rag or something and I like to put it underneath my bags respect my countertops and I just find something hard to start banging on the bags break everything [Music] once these look kind of broken up I will add my chocolate in [Music] now I'm just gonna pop these in the oven and they're gonna be in there for like 11 minutes or so you just watch them I'd like lines feeling a little like slightly golden [Music] so this is the bag that I decided to take with us tonight and I already have some of the cookies in here we've already made a few and then I also printed out the recipe in case they wanted to make them so I'm gonna put that in the bag as well with all the other cookies [Music] well that's it for today's video guys I hope that you enjoyed it I hope that you liked the threats of heat and if you try it let me know it's just an amazing recipe it's

the one that I'm using so it's a slightly slanted on one side I'm sorry I tried my best to fix it anyway today I'm going to try and make the recipes that are actually on the containers or packages of food because when I was younger I've always wondered if those recipes were actually good but you know my family information family did not actually have all those ingredients and for lack of monetary resources I didn't get a chance to make any of those but now that I have a young working adults I can finally get to those right here I have two things one is the classic the first one is this classic peanut butter from craft craft has always had this peanut butter cookie recipe at the back of their jars and I've always wondered how good it is so we're gonna make that today while those are baking in the oven I'm also going to try and making some smoothie at the back of this strawberry bag I found at Costco here it is called Sabrina's oriental induced smoothie and it just so happens I have most of the ingredients so I'm gonna make this one as well and those are the two things I'm gonna try out making today for this recipe I had a jar peanut butter some brown sugar and a here I'm just putting in some sugar in then I'm putting one hump of peanut butter actually make that two humps of peanut butter it was super sticky and then an egg and that's it only three ingredients some sugar it is one cup half a cup of sugar and one egg I don't understand right now I have a cup of strawberries but tablespoon of honey and I also have vanilla flavored Greek yogurt I'm only gonna use half of it because it requires half a cup I also have some chia seeds because the recipe does say that you can customize it with some chia seeds I know that I am taking out the basil leaves this is not an alternative I'm just adding it in for additional nutrients and texture I don't know texture is real thing but we'll put that there i brewed the green tea ahead of time and also it's been sitting in the fridge so it is now chilled and ready for the smoothie add a little bit of strawberries just to top it off I always get a little bit freaked out but blenders because I that experience is where they just blast off and start smoking so it is now done oh I'm gonna pour it out now and see how it tastes I finally finished the two dishes that I said it would make today which are the peanut butter cookies as recommended by Kraft Plus these strawberry smoothies recommended by the freezer bag that I got at Costco now I'm gonna see if the recommended recipes are actually as good as I hoped it would be I do in a caveat I did do some alterations especially with the peanut butter cookies because that recipe I tried to add a little bit more sure at the end and it still isn't thickened so I tried I don't really want to get diabetes now fearless so I put in some coconut flour just to thicken it up we have the peanut butter cookies here and strawberry smoothie let's try the peanut butter cookie first I know this one looks like someone took a bite out of it because it just broke in the of everyone else picking it up it's not bad I mean it's edible for sure it doesn't taste like peanut butter and it's not as sweet as I thought so very yeah I could finish this plate what I want to make more nuts I'm actually wash it down with a little bit of it's really now and actually not bad I would make it again mmm tentative would recommend there's something about the green tea that I put in here that really gives it a nice bitter contrast with the sweetness of the honey and the vanilla yogurt these strawberries that I have right now are not particularly sleeper we were part of anything so overall a well-balanced movie to accompany some decent peanut butter cookies anyway thanks so much for joining me on this episode of is this recipe worth it and hey I got some cookies got a smoothie I can't complain just to end off the week bye you", "X2cBA-dInK0": "today Kevin and I are and be trying some cookies from the Walmart bakery these don't say Walmart anywhere on them but they have like the little like they have like a Sun Shine symbol and that's kind of what that is on there so you know they're Walmart and we bought them in we know about these are the old fashioned peanut butter cookies and there were two dollars 87 cents had the paper no bad cookies and they were three dollars and 98 cents so for 287 you get 10 cookies and I'm gonna give you the calories right open it one cookie forty grams is a hundred and eighty calories my last one and there is sugar all the in sizes [Applause] let's say which one do I want I don't mind their packaging but I like the ones where you have to rip something off to seal them a little bit better do you yeah well these I mean think about anybody could walk up they could they could it's easier for me to take pictures with the container like this stuff because the stickers on the back when I have to take pictures of like the the Lofthouse cookie yeah I have to you can obtain use the girl I have to pry the cigarette I'm going to take pictures of the nutritional information and I'm about the kind of that have built that CoV poor thing all minute pop-up that's a good Kimber cookie actually it's gonna love those if you ever had that there when I read old fashioned peanut butter cookies my mind immediately went to school because at school they would always give you a peanut butter cookie for your dessert or a lot you know they would rotate but that's what those taste like they taste like school peanut butter cookies yeah their goodness all uh-uh and you could go back in line later if you had like a quarter or something out and get another cookie those are very good this they're soft to have a good peanut butter flavor that sugar on top of them oh yeah it's like yeah five out of five all day long but not because most the time when I have peanut butter foods I think yeah they don't taste like our cookies in fact yes this this is better so I'm glad you said that Kevin's right this is better than any of those those pillsbury ones you know that you buy in the refrigerated section and the rolls this is better than any of those we've had so many of those I think you're supposed to be able to to bake and they're supposed to taste like peanut butter begged out this actually tastes like peanut butter and you get the little pieces of a peanut just like you did in those from oh yeah yeah they taste just like I'm telling you they that's awesome these are the no bake cookies and they are 170 calories for one cookie 43 grams so no bake cookies if you don't know they use oatmeal for those so that that that bounds them together they're very ugly mm-hmm I love up nolo it depends on the kind of notes they use these taste okay they're not as high dollar hoaxes like Quaker Oats but you can tell oh I'm still very good do not speed up butter is not something they would be though those honestly Kevin those sisters like what my mom no magatama though they're good yeah the ones I make we're always more peanut butter but maybe they were know a long time yeah those those times like what my mom used to make and she would you know she would just get in the mood and they're easy to whip up oh yeah they really really are but this is nice because there re in a container for you and this work is already done and you don't have to clean help the pan I think the only bad part about making them at home is having to clean out the pan that you got the peanut butter in the right oh yeah it's it can be it can get like cement if you don't put water in Annamayya night um I think for no bake cookies I think those are delicious or do I do get the peanut butter and a little bit but it's mostly ice for what they are I would I would give those a 5 out of 5 - for what they are because I've had other no-bake peanut butters that did not have that peanuts for like it's really no yes so I like these better I like these than the name-brand that you can get in the bakery section group though number 7 Nomad choice would be this sorry girl you have you have to get these if you have a Walmart near you you need to be on the lookout for these these these are some of the best peanut butter cookies that I've had in a long long time brings back lots of memories so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "W5nb73eac1E": "OK GUYS, TODAY I'M GOING TO BE\nSHOWING YOU HOW TO MAKE ONE OF MY MOST POPULAR\nRECIPES OF ALL TIME ON AUDREYDUNHAM.COM FOUR INGREDIENT SOFT\nPEANUT BUTTER COOKIES. NOW IF YOU'RE\nANYTHING LIKE ME, PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES\nGO WAY BACK TO CHILDHOOD. THEY'RE SO GOOD,\nSO COMFORTING THERE'S JUST SOMETHING\nABOUT THAT FLAVOR THAT BRINGS YOU RIGHT BACK TO\nTHE GOOD OLD DAYS, RIGHT? BUT TODAY I'M GOING TO BE\nSHOWING YOU HOW TO MAKE A RECIPE\nTHAT'S SO SIMPLE, YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.\nHONESTLY, THERE'RE NO WET AND\nDRY INGREDIENTS SEPARATED, IT'S LITERALLY JUST FOUR\nINGREDIENTS INTO A BOWL. SO SIMPLE,\nSO EASY. OK, LET ME SHOW YOU. NOW, FIRST WE'RE GOING\nTO BE STARTING WITH OF COURSE,\nTHE STAR INGREDIENT, OUR PEANUT BUTTER. IF POSSIBLE, YOU WANT\nTO GET THE TYPE WHERE THE ONLY\nINGREDIENTS ARE PEANUTS AND MAYBE A LITTLE\nBIT OF SALT. SO WE'LL GET THAT\nINTO OUR BOWL AND YES, YOU CAN\nUSE OTHER NUT BUTTERS BESIDES PEANUT BUTTER\nIF YOU LIKE. I ACTUALLY LOVE THE\nTYPES OF NUT BUTTERS THAT BLEND A WHOLE BUNCH OF\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF NUTS AND SEEDS ALL TOGETHER, BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE GETTING\nA NICE VARIETY OF NUTRIENTS AND OMEGA-3s\nAND SIXES. TO SWEETEN, WE HAVE\nSOME MAPLE SYRUP AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,  ANY RECIPE THAT INVOLVES\nMAPLE SYRUP IS OFF TO A GREAT START. AND I SHOULD SAY, LOOK FOR THE\nPURE MAPLE SYRUP, NOT THE IMITATION\nPANCAKE SYRUP. FLIP THAT BOTTLE OVER. THE ONLY INGREDIENT SHOULD\nBE MAPLE SYRUP. IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE\nIN THE FLAVOR AND, OF COURSE,\nTHE QUALITY. NEXT WE HAVE\nGARBANZO BEAN FLOUR, AKA CHICKPEA FLOUR I LOVE THIS FLOUR! AND I'M USING IT MORE AND MORE\nAS TIME GOES ON. SUPER HIGH PROTEIN,\nSUPER HIGH FIBER FLOUR. IT'S REALLY, REALLY VERSATILE I USE IT IN A\nTON OF RECIPES NOW, I'M STARTING WITH JUST\nABOUT A HALF A CUP BUT WE MAY NEED MORE LATER. NEXT, WE NEED SOME SALT I WILL SAY, I START WITH JUST\nA QUARTER OF A TEASPOON BUT IF YOU KNOW FOR SURE THAT YOU PEANUT BUTTER\nDOESN'T HAVE ANY ADDED SALT OR IF IT'S VERY,\nVERY LOW IN SALT, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO\nWANT TO GO AHEAD AND ADD AN EXTRA\nQUARTER TEASPOON OK, THAT'S IT.\nSTART STIRRING. ALRIGHT, LET'S GET\nTHAT NICE STIR AND YOU WILL START TO SEE IT ALL COME TOGETHER\nREALLY NICELY. AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE IT PRETTY MUCH ALL\nMIXED TOGETHER, YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION. TAKE A LOOK AT THE\nCONSISTENCY OF YOUR DOUGH AND ASK YOURSELF COULD I MAKE DOUGH BALLS\nWITH THIS BATTER THE WAY IT IS? IF THE ANSWER IS NO, THEN YOU'RE GOING TO\nWANT TO ADD MORE GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR I ALMOST ALWAYS DO. SO WE START\nWITH A TABLESPOON AND STIR IT IN. OK, I THINK I COULD ACTUALLY\nUSE ANOTHER TABLESPOON. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW\nRUNNY YOUR NUT BUTTER IS. I ACTUALLY USED\nONE NUT BUTTER WHERE IT WAS A BLEND OF\nALL THOSE DIFFERENT NUTS AND SEEDS,.. AND IT REQUIRED AN EXTRA\nFOUR TABLESPOON OF GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR BUT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT\nONE AT A TIME TO SEE HOW MUCH YOU NEED. AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT  THAT EXTRA GARBANZO\nBEAN FLOUR DOESN'T AFFECT THE\nFLAVOR AT ALL STILL VERY DELICIOUS,\nSO SWEET.  PRETTY THICK... JUST LIKE THIS. ::LAUGHTER:: IF YOU HAVE THE TIME, YOU'RE WELCOME TO ALSO\nSTICK THIS IN THE FRIDGE FOR ABOUT FIVE\nTO TEN MINUTES TO MAKE IT EVEN EASIER\nTO ROLL INTO BALLS BUT, I'M GOING TO JUST GO\nFOR IT THE WAY IT IS. I LIKE TO LINE MY BAKING SHEETS\nWITH PARCHMENT PAPER JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES\nCLEANUP SUPER EASY AND IT ENSURES THAT THOSE\nCOOKES WILL NOT STICK. BUT, IF YOU HAVE A\nRELIABLE NON-STICK SHEET YOU'RE GOOD TO GO. START ROLLING THEM\nINTO LITTLE DOUGH BALLS. IT'LL STILL BE\nPRETTY SOFT. NOW, I WILL LET YOU IN ON\nA LITTLE SECRET. THESE COOKES ARE DELICIOUS\nENOUGH TO BE DESSERT, BUT THEY ARE HEALTHY ENOUGH\nTO BE BREAKFAST. NOW, THIS IS KEY KNOW\nFOR PARENTS OUT THERE WHO HAVE THREE YEAR OLDS\nWHO ARE VERY PICKY OR THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND\nABOUT WHAT THEY WANT FOR BREAKFAST EVERYDAY. I HAVE ONE OF THOSE KIDS.\n::LAUGHTER:: SO ON THE DAYS THAT MY\nLITTLE RED HEADED JACK IS FEELING VERY PICKY, I CAN ALWAYS BUST OUT ONE OF  THESE PEANUT BUTTER COOKES\nAND FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT HE'S EATING\nFOR BREAKFAST THAT DAY. POOR JEFF, I HAVE TO SAY... HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THE ONE\nTHAT GOT TO LICK THE BOWL AND THE SPOONS WHEN\nI'M DONE BAKING SOMETHING, BUT NOW, THERE ARE TWO KIDS THAT ARE ALMOST\nFOUR IN THE HOUSE THAT ARE VERY AWARE THAT\nTHESE THINGS EXIST NOW. AND HE'S GOT A\nLITTLE COMPETITION. SORRY JEFF. OK, SO NOW IT WOULD BE A TRADITIONAL PEANUT\nBUTTER COOKIE IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THOSE\nFAMOUS CRISS-CROSS MARKS WHICH I'M GOING TO MAKE NOW. JUST TAKE A FORK... AND GO TWO\nDIFFERENT DIRECTIONS STRAIGHT ACROSS THE TOP,\nJUST LIKE THIS. VOILA! WE HAVE PEANUT\nBUTTER COOKES. IT'S OFFICIAL! THEY JUST NEED TO GO INTO\nAN OVEN, 350 DEGREES, FOR ELEVEN TO TWELVE MINUTES. I'M SO HAPPY, I DON'T HAVE\nTO WAIT THOSE ELEVEN OR TWELVE MINUTES BECAUSE I MADE SOME\nEARLIER TODAY. HERE THEY ARE. LOOK AT THAT,\nSO PRETTY. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND\nEAT ONE NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND. MMM. THEY'RE SO SOFT. MMM. JUST DELICIOUS.

it's Father's Day this weekend and thought it'd be fun to show you how to make my husband's absolute favorite peanut butter cookie it is so easy and I got this recipe from not on other than my friend melody Fabulous Baker friend she got the recipe from oven Lee and the best thing about these cookies is that they are so easy they're also gluten free however when I bake I like to just go to town so there's a lot of sugar so simple whip together and Travis is obsessed because it's Father's Day I thought I would surprise in this weekend and make its favorite peanut butter cookies so are the ingredients I got 1 and 3/4 cup light brown sugar loosely packed at 1 and 3/4 cup creamy salted peanut butter 2 large eggs here at room temperature of 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla and coarse sea salt that we will top off the cookies before baking all you're gonna do is add the brown sugar to a medium bowl and then you're going to add your two eggs that are at room temperature into the brown sugar you're just gonna whisk it until smooth it's gonna add your half a teaspoon of vanilla with the vanilla in and then we're gonna add the peanut butter now that that's all done vanilla ice sugar done are going to add our creamy peanut butter so I've got this big bowl of yummy salted creamy peanut butter and we're just gonna pour that 1 and 3/4 cup peanut butter 2 1 and 3/4 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla and that's the only ingredients it is except for the sea salt that we will add to the top I'm just gonna stir this in until it's smooth now the key to kind of creating ridges in the top of the peanut butter cookies is you're gonna want to freeze the dough in a bowl for about 15 minutes the consistency of the peanut butter dough before I put it in the freezer and you can see it's just kind of thin and so I think your cookies would be really flat if you skip the freezer step in the freezer I ran out of parchment paper so I'm just gonna use this so Pat silicon mat instead and then here is my coarse sea salt to put on top of the cookies so the dough's been in the freezer for about I don't know eight minutes or so it says to give the dough a good stir halfway through just so the edges don't freeze and it just skips nice and hearts you can see it's kind of getting thicker so I'm gonna put it back in for about eight more minutes and then we'll do our scooping it was chilling the second time what do you guys getting your dad's for Father's Day like dads are like hardest people to shop for but he is so lucky because I'm taking the kids Monday for four days up it goes and he gets the week tune-up some time to just do whatever you want surf what he wants after work and overnight or whatever so here it is it's not really moving very fast I think it's perfect we're ready to scoop so I've got my education even a little scoop here it's gonna scoop it with the cookie scoop onto our parchment or your pack you can see after it's been frozen the cookie dough is like pretty set pretty nicely actually have to put it back in the freezer for another 15 minutes just to allow one more time to set if you don't really care about the shape of your cookies and kind of have then have like a nice kind of Ridge top and you can absolutely skip that step but I kind of like the look of them that way so I'm gonna follow the instructions in the description I'll put the recipe below course he saw a little bit of salt on top and I'm obviously obsessive cookies that have sea salt on top I'm gonna have to try really hard to stay away from these because they are so good and the best part is they're so easy so you guys will have to give em a try and let me know what you guys think all right back in the freezer 15 more minutes and then we're gonna be able to bake them here they are the freezer for the second time ready to go in the oven so the cookies are baking but I just wanted to hear from you guy and I try to do things each week that are something that I would

vodka you can check that button right there to figure out how to make peanut butter vodka one thing you want to do is scrape this know if scrape this to make sure that you have you know good mixture

Butter Cup and it's a triple peanut butter batter it has Reese's Pieces peanut butter chips peanut butter and the peanut butter cup it is so delicious let's get started to make the cookies we're going to be using 300 grams of peanut butter chips 230 grams of Reese's Pieces and we're going to be using between 15 to 20 Reese's peanut butter cups depends on how big you scoop out the batter now for the batter we're going to be using half a cup of chunky peanut butter you can use smooth if you want three-quarters of a cup of butter one cup of brown sugar half a cup of white sugar 2 cups of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract 1 teaspoon of baking soda one teaspoon of salt and 2 eggs so I have my butter in my mixer already and I'm going to cream it together with my peanut butter so just going to pop that in and then I'm going to put it on medium speed and I'm going to let it combine once the two butters are combined you can add in both of the sugars and then we're going to mix that up and add in the vanilla as its stirring next up we're going to put in our two eggs while the mixers on low once our ingredients are combined it is time now to put in our baking soda and our salt and our flour so I'm going to mix this all together until it combines completely to form a nice sticky dough and for the last stages of making the dough we're going to put in our Reese's Pieces into there and all of our peanut butter chips and I'm going to mix it on low until they're just combined you don't want to over mix this at this point because you don't want to break up the Reese's Pieces everything is all mixed in so now I'm taking a medium scoop up cookie scoop it's about a tablespoon to two tablespoons worth of cookie dough just going to scoop it in here and I'm going to make my little piles of cookie dough in on my baking tray with lined with parchment paper and then I'm going to pop them into the fridge for about half an hour that's just going to set the dough so it's not so sticky and we're going to next wrap up our Reese's peanut butter cups to make a little bit of a sandwich type cookie once the cookie dough is chilled you'll be able to handle it so what I'm going to do is just squish it down flat and then I'm going to put my Reese's Peanut Butter Cup right in the middle and then I'm going to push down my second batch flat and I'm going to squeeze it around and I'm going to pinch together the sides so that if there's so that there's no portion of the peanut butter cup sticking out so that's going to bake at 350 degrees for about 18 to 22 minutes when they're all finished I'll bring them out and I'm going to show you the finished cookies so there you go everybody how to make Reese's Peanut Butter Cup stuffed triple peanut butter

tiktok's viral\npeanut butter cookie recipe that's been going\nall over the internet. Today i'm coming at you with an improved version of this\nrecipe that's even more delicious and super easy to\nmake and only need six ingredients. If you're excited about\nthis video please give it a thumbs up, subscribe to the channel and hit the\nbell button to be notified every time i post a new video.\nThis recipe is so easy to make and you won't believe how fast it all comes\ntogether. Now the viral Tiktok recipe only calls for peanut butter\nbut i really wouldn't be myself if i didn't add chocolate to this,\nso i will make the cookies as is, just peanut butter, and\ndunk them in some melted chocolate once they're out of the oven,\nso you get the best of both worlds in one bite. let's get baking!\nSo to make this recipe all you're going to need is some peanut butter,\nsmooth peanut butter, some sugar and eggs, and also a splash of vanilla extract.\nThis is really really easy. I'm going to dunk everything together\nall at once. And as usual, all the measurements for\nthis recipe can be found on my website, which i will link down below.\nNow just give everything a good stir until it's a nice smooth dough. This is what it should look like once\nit's combined. It's really nice and smooth and also\nvery sticky. So now i'm just going to grab my baking\nsheets and we're going to dollop our cookie dough on the sheets.\nNow using my ice cream scoop, i'm going to scoop out about two tablespoons worth of dough, and\nsince this is very sticky dough, I recommend using\njust a small spoon to help you get it out of the ice cream scoop. Now i'm going to use just a regular fork\nand i'm going to press on my cookies in a vertical and\nhorizontal direction to create the classic crisscross pattern\nfor the cookies. These cookies will bake in a preheated\noven at 180 degrees for between 15 to 20 minutes. You want to\ncheck on them at the 15 minute mark and you're looking for the edges to start\nturning lightly golden brown. So my cookies were\nin the oven for exactly 17 minutes and I've let them cool down for about 20\nmore minutes. As you can see, they are really nice and\ngolden brown on the bottom, but they are still really soft from the\ntop and in the center. Now all i'm going to do is just dunk\nthem in my melted chocolate. All I've done to this chocolate is\ntaking some semi-sweet chocolate chips that i've\nmelted in the microwave in 15 second intervals,\nand once it was fully melted i added a little drop of\nvegetable oil to get it at a more liquid consistency. And now we're just going to dunk the\ncookies and let them set. Try to shake off the excess chocolate\nfrom them as much as you can, and voila! Keep repeating with the rest\nof your cookies. And that's it! How easy was that?\nDon't they just look gorgeous! Now these cookies will need to set\nfor one hour minimum at room temperature, or\n30 minutes in the fridge, just until the chocolate has hardened,\nand you can enjoy straight away! Just look at how amazing this looks!\nIt smells amazing and super soft texture. Absolutely delicious! So good i really hope you give this\nrecipe a try! The cookies are so soft and delicious\nand adding the melted chocolate just takes them to a whole new level.\nAnother idea or cookie variation that i literally just had right now,\nis to take two cookies and sandwich them with some jam in the middle.\nThat would be super amazing. Let me know in the comments below what is your\nfavorite flavor combination: peanut butter and\nchocolate or peanut butter and jam? Which team are you in? If you enjoyed\nthis video please give it a thumbs up, subscribe to the channel, I post a new\nvideo every single Thursday. You can also check the videos here for more tik tok\nrecipes and delicious cookie recipes until next week.\nBye", "Z1C7FFKwTRU": "well today Kevin and I are going to be comparing the another butter peanut butter cookies which I have here to the great values you know sandwich please I don't remember I can't find her I've done a video on these we've had the ones from great baby that are dipped in chocolate but I can't find a video on their just their peanut butter sandwich booties but just not too long ago we compared the letter butter cookies to the new Nutter Butter double nutty cookies so this is all the way that's the right these are the regular ones not the double money these are the regular ones and we have been eating on them actually I've been eating on the double nutty every night and Kevin's been eating on these okay one or two years you tried to save the double nutty and I'm the one eating the double so but I can tell you that this container of 16 ounces of the Nutter Butter was three dollars 56 cents this container is 15 point 2 ounces so a little bit smaller but it was only a dollar 68 for the great value brand now we were going to do a one a blonde taste test and I was gonna have Kevin put on the mask and everything but he said I'm gonna be able to tell the difference because the shape the shape of these is very very its distinct it's round but you need to pick one because go ahead but those are so much peanuts so you know No so these are two cookies or 130 calories yeah I should've looked at that on my father the calories for the Nutter Butter do you have no redundant [Applause] but so I think they're about the same and this packaging is definitely the same once you've opened it you have to put it in a ziploc bag you don't have a choice but these are around they have a picture a picture of a peanut almonds like a printed image so which one do you want to try okay definitely difference the footage horror mm-hmm nobody said it's hard it's dipped mm-hmm it's got solid brick the cookie yeah it facilitates horror tune yeah the cookie itself is a horror cookie but I want to really be able to taste up any better you know there's no difference I mean there's no comparison I don't think I don't need oh yeah they're nowhere near each other no I don't think they are either I do think the great value are good yep they're okay if you had about themselves and your disease no doubt about it yes if you bought these and you if you want to spend a dollar 68 and you don't want to bother the Nutter Butter you're not gonna have them side by side anyway you're not going to have a clue what you're missing you're not good enough then a little harder though it is a good peanut butter cookie it really is but if you want a good yeah it's sweeter it's sweeter sweeter has a touch of saltiness to it like a good peanut butter should has a really good deep peanut butter flavor or is that kind of taste like think it's crispy but it's not hard these are actually like what I would consider hard filling in here either not not that that's terrible but how much they know there's not much going great then these are the regular but I tell you what I said in the video I will for sure if I'm buying Nutter Butter which you know we don't buy a lot of cookies anyway because they're dangerous we have them here we will eat them but I do buy those double nutty and our Walmart today I look today they still do not have the double nutty at our location so we found the double nutty at a larger Walmart in a larger town the next town over I don't know why you would think the trucks that deliver them there would be the same truck that were here but they would make the warehouse to deliver the woman with Doris thank you yeah but they're not so these are good on the room not sitting next to something else their their past their fine yes they would be great if save some money and bomb for a kid's party or something like that we're eating with a glass of milk but it's for in a lot of things Walmart is just as good on you know Walmart they have those coconut Samoas cookies they're in minutes are good the the peanut butter or bitter chocolate cover they were very very good these there was a difference so for these I would rather spend a little bit more money and actually buy the Nutter Butter by the double nutty because they're even better if you're a peanut butter phonetic and I just think it it's just gonna be more pleasing to you these are definitely possible though so so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "y-q-f4TY-Qc": "[Music] hi guys I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode of Laura in the kitchen I'm going to show you how to make peanut butter cookies they're super super simple they just require a few ingredients but everyone's been asking for those so I figured you know what let me do it so let's go over the ingredients so we can get started you need some all-purpose flour some regular granulated sugar light brown sugar unsalted butter at room temperature smooth peanut butter 1 egg baking soda salt vanilla extract that's it super super simple but incredibly easy to do first thing you do is pre oven to 350 degrees and now we're gonna roll in with the dough making and this is very straightforward but you know the one thing I think is really crucial to this is to let the butter and the sugars beat for a long time by 3/4 minutes they get really nice and thick and pale and creamy makes a huge difference in your cookie I promise you so in my standing mixer I'm just going to put in one stick there's a half a cup of unsalted butter at room temperature granulated sugar and brown sugar half a cup of each I'm going to just turn this on and I'm going to let that go for literally like three four minutes I know I sound like this a long time so you really want that to be super thick and creamy makes a huge difference in the end so let's not go and then we'll add in our egg and vanilla extract my sugars and my butter I've been mixing for about 2-3 minutes as you can see it's really beautiful and creamy which I want so now to this with the motor running I'm going to add in my egg this one large egg and some vanilla extract just about a half a teaspoon you don't need a whole lot and I like this as well beat for about bitter choke I want it really nice and thick and pale almost like a slightly whipped cream it's consistency it's awesome it makes the cookies so fluffy and moist I guarantee it you don't know love when you do this chill just like let's go up a couple minutes that's perfect exactly what I want nice and thick and creamy now to this I'm going to add our peanut butter this is smooth peanut butter nap I am a lover of natural peanut butter the kind or the only ingredients in there is peanuts but for whenever you're baking that's not the peanut butter to use in fact I always keep up out container I like smooth peanut butter that you use for your kids you know PB and J's because when you bake with it if you wanted to use a natural kind it splits the oil from the peanuts split and then you have a really kind of awkward oily batter it doesn't work so use a natural peanut butter from your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but use that kind of stuff the creamy stuff for whenever you're baking so just mix this together till it's incorporated and the meantime I'm just gonna mix my making soda and salt into my flower that's a really strong peanut smell I love it now if you want you can add like chopped up pieces of peanuts but I'm not going to I really want to smooth texture of the cooking sometimes I'll even add this and now I'm gonna turn it down just a tad just like so and I'm gonna start adding in my flour I'm not gonna put it in all at once because I really want to smooth texture smooth consistency of the cooking so I'm just gonna do it little by little to make sure we avoid any lumps last bit of dry ingredients and mix until I see it's pretty much pulled together and then I finished mixing it with my spatula cuz I don't want I want to avoid overmixing suggest scrape it off the dough hook just using my spatula to mix everything from the bottom to make sure we didn't leave anything behind because sometimes it does that okay that's perfect I'm gonna take my baking sheet ungreased nonstick very important and this is my cookies cookie scooper it's a 1 tablespoon scoop measure so if you don't have one of these you can just use your 1 tablespoon on like measuring spoon and just use that as your guide because you want them to be about 1 tablespoon each and you have to play some a couple of inches apart because it will expand and they will stick together so you want to avoid that as much as possible it's on the end of the world but if you can avoid it do just gonna scoop them onto my cookie sheet and then we're going to proceed with the next step and last cookie now I'm not gonna make all of them I'm gonna take I'm gonna gonna make about half the batter and take the remaining half and put in the freezer because this batter freezes beautifully and okay so next step you want take your two fingers on the palm of your hand and you just want to flatten the cookie just slightly flatten the cookies just like so I'm so easy and get your kids to do it I mean it to me it's something that I like enjoy to do because it's you have to really think it's easy let go just press them down with your fingers like I said you could use the palm of your hand doesn't really matter as long as you're getting them flattened and then how long do it even leave that and then you take a fork you even make crisscross patterns like that and like that just like cell onto each cookie it wouldn't be a peanut butter cookie without the crisscross patterns I mean come on so just continue to do the rest of them and then we're gonna bake them last one and here we go now these are going to go into your preheated oven and bake for about 15 to 18 minutes and now if you possible you want to place your oven racks top and middle and void the bottom because sometimes it can scorch the bottom of the cookie before it's perfectly done so I'm just going to put these in and bake them for 15 to 18 minutes until lightly golden and I'm gonna let them cool for about five minutes on the baking sheets and then let them cool completely on a wire rack and my cookies bake for about 15 to 16 minutes and I don't them cool for about five minutes on the baking sheet and I move them to a wire rack to cook and Flemmi and now they are done and they smell divine I'm telling you it the smell if you love peanut butter you know love these cookies it sounds a quick bite oh good what I think one thing that can make this better in my opinion it's a sandwich down between like some really really good grape jelly come on one W awesome note to self dee-licious but I hope you guys saw how easy this was and I would be going a kitchen and make these and to get all the ingredients and get all the full recipe you can find on my website at www.att.com/biz you hi guys I have some great and exciting news to share with you I now have an app you can

your device and search for Lara Vitali or Laura in the kitchen now I have a lot of exciting updates coming for this app so stay tuned", "WHPOsr37lIQ": "today Kevin are going to be trying and the another butter double nutty cookies I am extremely excited about these because I love peanut butter anyway I love Nutter Butter cookies these were 356 at Walmart they weren't in the regular cookie aisle they were on a display yeah in the middle yeah it's a little long these are a family size so 356 for 15 point 27 ounces for 32 grams I don't think that's bad and this typical price for most cookies it says the peanut butter lovers cookie two times the smooth beanie teeny teeny peanut butter creams with more premium right made with real peanut butter yeah I love a good notable yeah I made a two cookies are 170 calories peanut butter sandwich cookies yeah and there's twelve servings in here we noticed before we started recording that they don't have a opening like yeah Oreo does turtle yeah I know really yeah nothing to do about it good [Applause] I don't know necessarily I guess it has more cream yeah that has more cream because another better freak then when you buy the regular Nutter Butter they don't have it sticking out through that it's not hanging out beside this peanut butter is hanging out the side that well that is a good-looking oh yeah hmm not so good to Beamer boobies yes those excellent must be in our fingers I don't like because they're not peanutty enough they don't have that really good peanut butter right these always have right and this is just more of mm mm good and typically peanut please especially the pound that you buy in the refrigerated section in the roll they can be boring believe it or not even though it's peanut better even with cold food grown bubble so what I usually put sugar I take a little Ellen up a saucer of sugar and I'll take my fork and dip it in there and then I'll make the the crosses on the top with this before that makes them better the best way to make those is with the Hershey's kiss didn't you get mortal right when they come out of the oven put your little Hershey's kiss on there they're delicious but anyway sorry these I think they're wonderful and I do think they have twice as much peanut butter and jelly mess for repeal employment and it it is soft peanut butter so like I'm not saying in the regular Nutter Butter it's hard but there's not enough there to really judge it it seems dry right the peanut butter itself that's a good word it does seem drier so this it just seems very very creamy well we've decided right we decided we were going to compare these so when you see the the title of the video comparison you're like hey I thought they were going to compare those to the regular ones when went back to the store because Kevin's like you know I really wish we had compare them and I said I do that just like we did an Oreo video before yeah that was a good idea so I wish we had thought to do it from the from the very beginning of the video but we didn't so that's okay we're gonna do it now these were the same price as those these were three dollars 56 cents and the this is a 16-ounce 453 brand pie two months 432 grams right with a whole pie right these are 130 calories for two cookies the doubles are 170 calories okay so anything else you want to know my house 24 15 16 times 2 so think about that they weigh almost the same thing how can you stay but this one has each month the doubles way what I think 18 18 ounces and the right ones like 14 it won't take the difference so so you can see the differences in the package of how many how many cookies you get so like I told Kevin earlier you know when these cookies they have peanut butter hanging out facade the regular you can see the peanut butter but it's not hanging out the side do you think that cookies a little thicker too or is it the same the cookies look a little just not touch it's hard to tell it's hard to tell it does kind of look like the cookies bigger but it can also be a cream playing with your that peanut butter cream playing with your on to me yeah I don't know no I think that cookies definitely bigger ma'am yeah so the cookies bigger and you get more cream so yeah we don't have dollar oh you can do whatever you want you can definitely taste it ever this is the devil yeah and you can definitely taste the difference it's still you know of course it tastes the same you just get more it's like fun a regular Reese's Cup versus the big cup you know mmm no man a regular Risa Scott versus a one of the thins caps this would be a thin cap and those would be the think I think the doubles are just a touch sweeter to it well thought they probably are though cream in them I still like them both I still think they're both delicious cookies but what would I buy all the time those double would definitely need my goat Jam now our local Walmart when we went to pick these up they did not have that we bought those at a larger Walmart in the next town over on and display our Walmart we did not see that display anywhere because we did the loop through you know you got to go through the whole back of the store because they might have hidden something back there that's what they usually do and we went down you know next to the meats and stuff and you know we we make the look around and our Walmart did not have them out so but in our a person that bought things like all the time I would completely drop them and how would go to the double honey yeah probably two because they're they're bigger they have a lot more people are in there also that cream is creamier I mean it could be just because there's more of it but it seems to be much prettier better oh yeah that would be my go-to from now on directly i it will shock me if these do not stay around I think they're gonna be around for a long long time thank you because anybody peanut butter lovers are the ones that buy these cookies anybody that loves peanut butter and you're only going to love having more peanut butter I don't know if those different thickness or not that's what I'm saying I really I can't tell if the cookie itself I think it's just more cream yeah they're good and stuff and that's what they were saying on the tags they're not it trust me if that cookie was bigger they wouldn't have told you it was a bigger better cookie they're turning this yeah this one they're just telling you it's two times more just and what they're cooking soup yes because y'all waiting on the table they call it the same thickness yeah so definitely you gotta try that double no they are absolutely delicious I'm really happy that Nabisco did this so I hope you enjoyed the video and thanks for watching [Music]", "DbPUE2qFy2Y": "excuse me sir can you get on my shot please this is Brad is one two tree all right I know you know you're in the shot [Music] I think I'm stealing a beginner sighs singing oh my god hi friends today we are making some cookies these cookies will have everyone's mouth draw okay I also done a video where I cooked of tea you guys we'd like that so if you haven't seen that you can check that in the cards on and I did a meal prep video and you can check that in the cards as well if you want but today I thought I'd show you some cookies I'm gonna make four he and his teammates because basically I think when it's someone's birthday you bring in like cupcakes or like something a treat for your birthday so he has to bring something in so he was like I should make my cookies and I was like I think that's a good idea because I miss making those cookies so I'm gonna make some cookies for him and his teammates and for tomorrow so yeah as long as we'll show you because I can do it anyway it sounds like maybe people interested in this I don't know but anyways I'm gonna show you guys how to make my amazing cookies a lot of people rave on about these everyone that's tried it and love loves it so I am very excited to show you guys so for today's ingredients you need some M&Ms you need some milk chocolate chips you need some peanut butter you need three large eggs vanilla extract baking soda light brown sugar white sugar boats and butter and yeah that's we need for today if I'm correct and just we get started at first we are going to get the peanut butter for the peanut butter I'm gonna need one cup and a quarter chunky peanut butter is really great for these cookies because it makes the texture really chewy and crunchy and I'm just gonna add it in here first make sure the measurements are correct which would be the sugar okay we're gonna have 1 cup of brown sugar like so and then we're gonna need 1 cup of white sugar so we're gonna add 8 tablespoons of softened butter so what you're gonna do is just gonna scoop in 8 scoops this recipe guys I swear to god this is the truth if you're allergic to peanuts I don't say sorry ok I'm very sorry I feel vegan I am also greatly so we have 8 than that now what we're gonna do is we're just gonna mix this up before we add the breast this makes it very easy to mix and make sure that everything blends in together so now we're gonna add the eggs make sure those shots get in there okay and then we're gonna add the vanilla which would be one tablespoon vanilla extract and then we're going to mix it up before we add the M&Ms because we don't want to blend up that M&Ms okay so that is all what blended up and now we're going to add four cups for boats if you feel like good cookies our school to where it's okay to add more usually adds a bit more maybe five sometimes six depending on yeah so once we add the oats we're just going to mix it up like slight see look I'm just gonna add a bit more underwear this wouldn't be very chewy okay okay so my other camera type I'm gonna try and show you guys so we have the next shot all that we have left it's been basically to add the chocolate chips I'm the M&Ms put it on the baking tray and then bake so I'm just gonna add chocolate chips and I'm all pack to the mixture and then we're going to mix it with a spatula so we've added the M&M I'm chocolate chips so I'm just going to carry on mixing it with the hands boom right slow and now it's time to get our bacon drink basically you're going to get in the mixture and we're going to put it in our hands like so and then we're going to make some cookies so I like to make the large cookies so I want to put it around here so it will expand so don't worry I'll put it around here you want to make sure it's not too big but not too small [Music] afterwards with the left over M&Ms we're going to add it on top so it just adds a little box if you know what I mean so just basically gonna put some on top sort of a nice and colorful you just add a little extra something something so now we're going to put it in the oven 475 degrees and yeah bake it for 12 minutes nuts it in there like that now we're just gonna leave it for 12 minutes it's gonna put time on so I do not forget minutes if you have more than one baking tray that would be great because you get more in and more out so yeah okay guys so that is it for the end of the video so this is how your cookie should end up looking after they first did and yeah they're good to go I hope t and his teammates like he's confused and it's Kiba I hope you guys try out this recipe and yeah it was so much fun to make and you guys I promise you these cookies are bomb diggity okay and yeah that's it I shall see you in my next video

mayonnaise how are you today oh that post makes my double chin disappear look so huh so today I have a new DIY for y'all I am making a giant Nutter Butter cookie in case if y'all don't know what a Nutter Butter is or if you never had a Nutter Butter another butter he's a cookie went poopy why you biting my tri paws my dog he's biting my tripod he loves to chew things anything there's a cookie that shaped like a peanut and I took a sandwich it has peanut butter in the middle and it's peanut butter cookies and it just tastes like an explosion of peanut butter in your mouth I haven't had them since I was a kid and I honestly really missed them so I thought you know I'm an adult now so I have to make in my size so why not make a giant Nutter Butter so that's what I'm gonna do today I'll make two giant cookie put them together make a big peanut butter cookie sandwich I'm so excited movie if he's biting my tripod he needs a bath imma give him one today he's looking kinda kind of dirty so yeah today I'm gonna make a Nutter Butter and I'm really excited about it so here's that subscribe button for more DIYs and other kind of videos that are coming up next week I'm really excited and also give this video a thumbs up for peanut butter because I'm kidding me that's it so here let's guitar let's make this Nutter Butter I'll see you guys when I taste it so the guest started to take a really pretty green Bowl it has to be green and um put in a half a stick of butter don't y'all hate when the butter won't come off of the wrapping and you don't want to touch it that happened to me right then I had to touch it a little bit so then I added some sugar and some brown sugar both of the sugars and I'll mix them together with this butter and the butter was supposed to be room temperature but guess what I didn't make a room temperature I know I'm crazy but I know that God still loves me even though I sinned so I mashed that together with my manly muscles and then I added in a chicken fetus and egg I mixed it together and it turn into this really gross looking mush but guess what everything is beautiful and it all turns beautiful in the end that's what happens with this so I just added peanut butter and that made it like prettier it made it look a little better so that I added the dry ingredients like flour and baking soda and song y'all I used to not understand why salt was added to sweet recipes but then I realized it enhances the sweetness oh my goodness can't believe I figured out the meaning of life so I smooshed that all together and it turned into a beautiful cookie dough and then I sprayed my pan not with Pam because I was out of hand I sprayed it with I can't believe it's not butter because it always surprises me so I messed up here I thought that if I put like the dough as two balls it would kind of like melt into a peanut shape but they didn't melt at all so when they were halfway cooked I had to smush them down and form them into a peanut shape but it all turned out beautifully and then I put it back in to the oven I almost dropped it there either and I've heard it back into the oven until they were cooked and then I just carved out a little more to make it look more like a peanut and then yeah there's my two cookies y'all feld aim for the center filling I'll put in tons of peanut butter and it was total Isha's look at that peanut butter it's so bootiful I sound like Miranda sing and then I put the other one on top of it and yeah that's the peanut duh Nutter Butter I mean sandwich cookie thing and it was oh my goodness

our peanut butter half a cup peanut butter is a little hard to measure out there's probably a better way to do this that Nana would know but this is just going to have to work for me and we're going to mix that together okay now we're going to beat our milk and egg together and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and we're simply just going to beat that together okay now we're going to add that into our mixture from the mixer on slowly and now we're slowly going to mix in our flour mixture slowly [Applause] and we're going to let that go for a minute now for this recipe you're going to need a mini muffin pan and then what you're going to do is you're going to take your mixture that you just made and you're going to roll it into a 1 inch ball and then you're going to place it in your muffin pan okay as you can see I put all the cookies into the muffin pan I've preheated the oven to 375 we're going to put these in for about 8 minutes and i will see you when they're done alright our cookies are out of the oven now the next part is very important that you do this quickly you're going to take your reeses cups and you're going to press down now the recipe didn't call for it but I actually am going to use milk chocolate reeses and I'm also going to use dark chocolate that's personal preference you can use one of the other doesn't really matter now that they're all pressed in there going to cool down and then I'll show you what it looks like when they're cool so our cookies have finally cooled off it took about three hours for them to cool I used a knife to pop them right out of a muffin pan no issues there if you liked watching this video please hit that big red subscribe button leave me a comment like the video and hopefully Nana will be back in the next week or so if you

and today we made no baked chocolate peanut butter cookies did you have no bakes as a kid I remember having those all the time growing up they're delicious what if you could make them and they were keto friendly not just full of oatmeal guess what that's what this recipe is they're delicious you're gonna love it check it out okay let's get started this is such a simple recipe I love it I've got my shredded coconut unsweetened I've got some swerve and cocoa powder I'm gonna mix these two together first just to get kind of the dry ingredients and I mix it together let me not use the peanut butter spatula yet I was gonna put them in here there we go okay now we're gonna dump in our almonds we've got these slivered almonds I'm gonna add in some liquid stevia probably one two [Music] and like three little squirts of it and let's throw in our vanilla I've got a teaspoon of vanilla here there we go and then of course the ingredient that makes it all work our peanut butter scrape our peanut butter in here yes I love using organic just basic peanut butter nuts and sea salt right now we're just gonna take this and mix it all together now the fun part we got to make it into little balls and look at this I mean they're bite-sized you can make them as big or little as you want I think some of those are a little bit bigger than I really want we're just putting them on some wax paper okay look at this I mean you could call them pretty if you think chocolate looking cookies are pretty I'm gonna kind of just roll this up a little bit so that I can easily carry it might be make more sense just get a tray hey you can put them on and stick in your freezer but our freezers jam-packed so we're gonna freeze them for like 30 minutes to our and then we are going to eat them so let's see if I can do this without making a mess okay I guess it's time to try him mm-hmm like seriously similar to my mom's chocolate no big cookies you can make them more similar just by reducing the peanutbutter increasing the chocolate but Wow I love it great combination of coconut the almonds in there you can add whatever nuts you want really I'm telling you you're gonna like this one I think your kids are gonna like it something is just keeping the freezer I'm not gonna lie though it's a little bit messy when you eat it so just be aware have a napkin but I'm telling you this was simple it's fun it's Quito it's cute dad approved so with that have an amazing day keep it simple keep it fun keep it Quito we'll talk to you soon", "fVzYs1X1EyY": "[Music] hi there it's lindsay here today we are making the most delicious chewy and crunchy peanut butter cookies they're super easy and fast so i'll just show you how i make them we're going to start out with half a cup of peanut butter and a stick of butter let's soften that butter up and put it in the mixer with the peanut butter and mix it around until it's very good and mixed up [Music] now for the second portion of this we're just going to use a cup of light brown sugar i mix my own and also adding in one egg and a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract the real stuff not the fake stuff it does make a difference [Music] we're just gonna mix this up until it is very light and fluffy so you can't over mix this so keep on mixing if you're worried about it but we're just gonna make this very light and fluffy until it changes color for the third portion of this i'm just going to mix up half a teaspoon of baking soda quarter teaspoon of salt and one and a quarter cup of all-purpose flour i'll mix that together and add it in about a scoop at a time until it's well incorporated and we don't want to over mix this part so mix it up until it's just incorporated and that's it for our batter i do prep my baking sheet with parchment paper i think that's the best way to make cookies but the first time i used a cookie scoop and they kind of had shaggy edges which is fine it's okay especially if you're just gonna eat them but i wanted these to be a little bit pretty because i was gifting them so the second batch i actually rolled them in my hands and made a perfect ball before i scored them with a fork i just make a cross hatch with a fork and if it starts to stick you can add a little butter or oil to your fork that way it doesn't stick and mess up your cookie design but these just go into a 375 degree oven for 10 minutes [Music] do [Music] i like to let mine cool on a wire rack while i make my next batch but you can definitely see the difference between batch one and i'll show you batch two in just a little bit it just had smoother edges and they looked a little bit nicer so if you have the time i'd suggest rolling them [Music] and there we have it super simple peanut butter cookies they are

she describes them as much more gooey and deliciously peanut buttery than most other peanut butter cookies and adds that even though they're gluten-free everyone ended up loving them we'll get started by preheating the oven to 350 degrees next grease two baking sheets or do what Allrecipes member joni advises and line your sheets with parchment paper or a non-stick baking net break four eggs into a large bowl and use a fork to beat them lightly measure 2 cups of smooth peanut butter into the bowl Lara points out that it's best to use natural peanut butter and sometimes people with gluten allergies can also have a sensitivity to preservatives found in some peanut butters add 2 cups of sugar if use a mixer or a wooden spoon to mix the dough until it's smooth if you like add two cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and one and a half cups of chopped pecans then stir the dough until the chips and nuts are mixed in well use a medium scoop to drop spoonfuls of the dough onto the baking sheet about two inches apart bake the cookies until they're lightly browned this will take about 10 to 12 minutes allow the cookies to cool for five to ten minutes and then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely many Allrecipes members note that these cookies are delicious on their own without the optional chocolate chips and the nuts either way have fun making these gluten-free peanut

Today on Simply Bakings, I will be sharing with you these delicious Keto-friendly Peanut Butter Chewy Cookies! They are so addicting it! You guys will love them! Let's begin! For this recipe, all you will need are four ingredients: Peanut butter, keto friendly sweetener, vanilla, extract, and 1 egg. Then grab a large bowl\nand to that bowl, you're going to add the peanut butter. It's best if you use natural peanut butter - it requires mixing so that's when you know it's natural. And if you don't want to use peanut butter, you can use other nut butters, you have\navailable. Next, we're going to add your keto friendly sweetener . I can't remember the name but it starts with E. I will let you know in the comments or in the recipe what kind of sugar I use. You can also use coconut sugar even though some people think it's not keto friendly. Anyway, you're gonna add one egg and one and a half teaspoons of vanilla. The vanilla extract is actually optional. You can actually make this down to three ingredients but I love the flavor of vanilla extract so I decided to use it. So you want to make sure everything or\nall the ingredients are incorporated very well. You don't want to taste just sugar in one part of the cookie and also if you notice that your cookie dough is a little bit on the dry side, that is because you probably didn't use a large egg. You used a medium size so if that happens, you could add up to a tablespoon\nof your choice of milk. I use almond milk because that happened to me but only add the one tablespoon of almond milk or your choice of milk if the cookie dough\nis really on the dry side. because the recipe is good as is as long as you use a large egg -  that's key -  a large egg. Anyway, now you're going to scoop the cookie dough onto the cookie sheet and then use your fork and make the famous\npeanut butter cookie sign. Super easy! Also, guys, to get this recipe head over\nto my blog Simply Bakings and it does help me if you head over there so please do and grab the recipe. So to bake the cookies, you're going to place it in a preheated oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and once it's done baking, you're gonna remove it and let the cookie sit on the cookie sheet for about\nthree or four minutes so leave it alone don't touch it because it will fall\napart. Once it's done or once four minutes have passed, transfer the cookies over to a cookie rack and let it cool completely which shouldn't take long. So once they've cooled, go ahead and take that bite and you will notice how sweet\nthe cookies are and how chewy they are So they're just classic peanut butter\ncookies but keto friendly for those of you who are on a keto diet. And you won't\nmiss out because these cookies are so delicious and addictive. So beware! Thank you guys so much for watching! I really appreciate you guys and I will see you next week! I promise I should have a video up already oh and I'm going to a\nconference, The Everything Food conference. If you guys are there, I would love to meet you! DM me or email me and let's hang out! Bye guys!", "YvL6cpHE9P4": "hi everyone i'm haley and today i'm going to be making the best peanut butter cookies you will ever eat they're really easy to make they have oh quite a few ingredients but they're going to be so much better than all the peanut butter cookies that are like it's only three ingredients the ingredient number does make a difference so get ready to have the most perfect peanut butter cookie ever let's get started the first thing we're going to do is mix together one egg with half a cup of salted butter i'm also gonna add one teaspoon of vanilla extract and i'm gonna mix all that together until it's nice and creamy so here it is it's like there's the butter and there's some liquid at the bottom but i'm going to just go ahead and add in the next ingredient and it's going to help bring it all together so next we're going to add in half a cup of creamy peanut butter and i'm using salted peanut butter but i think unsalted peanut butter would work fine if that's all you have i'm gonna beat the peanut butter in so as you can see all the problems that we had with the last mixture went away when we added the peanut butter it's nice and creamy now and don't forget to scrape down the bottom and the sides of your bowl to make sure it all gets well combined now in a separate bowl i'm going to combine all the dry ingredients so i have one and a half cups of all-purpose flour three quarters cup of packed light brown sugar i love how it falls in a block three quarters a cup of granulated sugar three quarters a cup of peanut butter chips three quarters of a cup of peanut uh chopped salted peanuts and one teaspoon of baking soda and now i'm just gonna combine this all the peanut butter cookie mix is all done so now i'm just going to add my peanut butter cookie mix to my mixer and blend it until it's well combined alright i'm done mixing all my ingredients together and now it's time to scoop these cookies up so we can get them in the oven okay so now to scoop out the cookies i'm using a tablespoon and normally i do use a cookie scoop but this tablespoon is the perfect size it makes them nice and round it just sets you up for success just place it on the cookie sheet and i'm just going to keep scooping out my cookies [Music] now that i'm done scooping on my cookies i'm going to bake these my oven is preheated to 350 degrees fahrenheit and i'm going to start at 10 minutes to bake these but you want to take them out as soon as they're getting a little bit crisp on the edges and voila fresh out of the oven i baked these for 10 minutes they are perfectly golden and here's a little something that i like to do it is not required but i like to just take a fork and do a little crisscross that way a little crisscross that way all right my cookies are slightly cold and now i'm ready to try one oh my gosh oh my gosh these cookies are so delicious and so flavorful definitely the perfect cookie for anybody who loves peanut butter even if you just think peanut butter is kind of meh it's still a nice cookie you know and also i was worried about these because my oven does some crazy things sometimes like it went up to 400 while they were baking so i had to cool it down a little but these have the perfect texture they're crispy on the bottom and on the edges but then they're so soft in the middle and chewy i'm serious if you're looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe to impress people this is the one or just for yourself you know you deserve a good cookie well thank you so much for baking with me today let me know in the comments

of my all-time favorites but we are going to be making these cookies with out cookie cutters and I think they are going to be really really cute and you can make them for Valentine's Day or any time that you need a heart cookies so I have everything behind me to mix our cookies together we can get started on mixing them shaping them baking them and then eating them of course so let's head back to the mixer and start mixing together our Kido okay so I already have my butter and peanut butter in the mixer you are going to need a half a cup of softened butter and a cup of peanut butter and then just mix it around just for a teeny tiny little bit and then you're going to add in 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar so I've already mixed together the two butters and now I'm going to just add in my two different sugars and then we will cream them together [Music] [Applause] alright once you have creamed together the butter and the sugar is you can scrape down the bowl and then add in one tablespoon of vanilla and one whole egg [Applause] as soon as your egg and vanilla are completely incorporated you're going to get your dry ingredients and whisk them together you're gonna have a half a teaspoon of salt one teaspoon of baking soda and one and a half cups of flour so just mix that together so it's all incorporated and then we're going to add this in gradually as the mixer is on low [Music] [Applause] [Music] as soon as your dough comes together make sure you stop mixing it because you don't want to over mix it I have a cookie sheet here lined with parchment paper you can't double your trays because this is such a light cookie it does get very very brown on the bottom but this tray does work good for me so they don't get too Brown so this is the one that I'm going to be using I'm going to scoop out all my cookies with my cookie scooper you can get this a Target Walmart wherever and it will be labeled cookie scooper so I'm going to line these up and then we will get to the step of making them into hearts once you have all of your cookies made you're going to take one flap it out and start to shape it into the shape of a heart it does not have to be perfect but you kind of just flatten it out and then pinch it at the ends to make a little triangle and then at the top you pinch it out and then Pat your finger in there to make like a little heart shape like so and then you are going to take a fork and just make some imprints on it just like you would a regular peanut butter cookie and then that makes a heart so you're gonna do this with the rest of them and then we are going to throw them into our preheated 350 oven for about eight to nine minutes and then we will be finished [Music] [Music] our peanut butter cookies are finally finished I cannot wait to dive in on these they are just really really really cute and I'm sure they're going to taste even better than they look which seems near impossible thank you guys so so much

holistic nutritionist and welcome to sweet and savory health it's been a while and I missed you guys I have a new recipe to share as you here it is so when I work with my clients lots of them often say that they have trouble cutting out some of their favourite baked treats from their diet but I often tell them not to completely cut out something from their diet just because it's the right thing to do for me everything is about having a balance when you have a healthier version of your favorite recipe and it contains all the nourishing ingredients I don't see a reason why you shouldn't have that if you know me from my blog and the store you know I had this week and I love good food and treats so I often find healthier ways to incorporate those strategically into my diet so I'm not feeling so guilty of having them on a regular basis so without further roughly kitchen are you ready this is going to be a very quick recipe so make sure to preheat the oven first before you gather your ingredients and here are the ingredients you need I'll also make sure to post the full recipe with step by step pictures on my blog make sure you check out the link in the description box below the easiest way to make the cookie batter is to first combine the dry ingredients give them a swirl and then combine your wet ingredients then you want to float the wet ingredients into the dry mixture and mix them really well you can create that signature crisscross peanut butter cookie pattern with the fork here we go ten minutes later you have your peanut butter cookies I hope you enjoy my new recipe and if you ever attempt to make them please hashtag me on instagram sweet and savory health I'd love to see your creations and Oh before you go please remember to give this video a thumbs up and I'll see you next time", "yCREoybXtrs": "yeah beautiful people and welcome back to the channel if you do hear I'm so so happy to meet you today I want to be showing you how I made is amazing brownie tart with peanut butter this is basically the same recipe I used to make the my brownie which I'll put the link in the corner there what I've done I have freezin half of that so when I found that video you will see I use half of the recipe to make the cocoa Shaarawy and then have the side half of that we'll keep it in the freezer for future users and today I have the really request from a husband to say it was some some cookies alright let's do something a bit different and so put some peanut butter and a little tart tatin so very very yummy right guys keep watching the tutorial super super simple and I will see you very soon okay guys so super super simple so in here I got my mix which has been in the freezer for a few weeks so what you do guys you get one of these little more primal in there and then you just simply press it down you just cover it I've been very very generous but once they cook all the butter will melt so you don't need to cover this you probably get four out of this yeah definitely so there you can use chocolate bread instead of peanut butter but for this recipe I really really wanted to use them in a box if I saw this on Pinterest I think it was a cafe in Chico or Chicago or so what in America they have they have a bakery and so this is a really nice blade to have it didn't have those shapes but I thought I have some tough some metal team tarvold so I thought I could do the same and I have some peanut butter not much left as you can see but what you do guys you get a spoonful teaspoonful I'm sure I can get for ya J absolutely love this recipe he loves cookies and last time guys have made them and I thought he said can answer modernize the world I actually pulled the rest of the recipe of the dough in the in the freezer well we can have another time you don't you know we don't have to have the morning once because it's only two of us so what you guys do with your finger you just spread it all around just like that okay you do the same with the other three so he has requested this today and I thought Jays at home all day now because he doesn't have to go to work it's been told to stay at home so I think he's a little treat for him bless him because he's working on his collection while he's at home but still he's a bit he's a bit boring to stay at home all day so I thought it's giving me some treat okay so now they're gonna go in the oven at 175 grab-grab Celsius for approximately 10 to 15 minutes you've was able to done because the butter will melt and don't overcook them because it's too need to be gooey in the middle okay we'll come back guys when they're all nice and gold I say guys to just come out the of it now I don't in fact this is still yeah it's still extremely hot but what I want to in fact and I mean just lift it and know it looks burnt but I can guarantee you is not guys because obvious brown sugar you will get this amazing gold and colonists of course mmm the peanut butter so they are extremely gooey in the middle of what I'm going to do in a minute once they are be cooled down I will remove the metal thing and I'm just gonna leave them to to cool down at room temperature form for an hour before we eat them there will be too hot to eat straight away okay that is it guys I hope you like the recipe if you did please please please give me a usual thumbs up because I was supportive

drizzle so today i am so excited about these double peanut butter cookies so here are the ingredients and let's get started first we're going to start off with 2 3 cups of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of baking soda and we're going to whisk those girls together so whisk it whisk it real good i'm so cheesy [Music] all right now starting off with our wet ingredients we're gonna need one stick of unsalted butter one heaping cup of creamy peanut butter and i use gif i love gif peanut butter one cup of light brown sugar and pack it that's why i was patting it down make sure it's good and packed and 1 3 cup of sugar and we want to cream this together normally when you cream your butter and your sugars together you want to make sure that they're incorporated one thousand percent so i'm going to take my time and really go through and cream all these ingredients together okay so we're gonna add one large egg [Music] and we're gonna add one teaspoon of my homemade vanilla which this video will be coming out soon and continue to blend [Music] so we are all finished with the wet ingredients let's go ahead and add in our dry ingredients [Music] here i just want to make sure that you guys know we're going to just incorporate these ingredients together we don't want to over mix this okay so i'm going to stop here and then grab my bag of reese's peanut butter chips and throw them in there that's about 1 to 1 3 cups of the peanut butter chips and i'm going to fold the chips together now you see how everything is pulled in the middle what i really want to do here is fold the chips so it's an even distribution so with every scoop that i have i have an ample amount of chips in every single scoop take your time [Music] now this batter is a little sticky so what we want to do put some saran wrap on top throw it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes [Music] alright so our batter has had time to sit and get our cookie scoop scoop them in put them on our baking sheet or a cookie sheet and i'm here to tell you this is the easiest batter to scoop and drop on the sheet so easy now you want to put these in the oven 375 for eight to nine minutes and they should look like this this is optional this is just me being extra i always push them down to push the air out of them you most certainly do not have to do that but that's just me i'm i'm an extra person so i'm looking at the cookies and i'm thinking to myself they they are not seeing what i'm seeing here so i really wanted to switch up the view here and give you guys a texture shot so you can see exactly what i'm looking at here the tops of these cookies they look slightly under baked which i understand concerns but trust me they are not undercooked look at that the tops will not be set [Music] so if you decide not to let them sit i just wanted to give you an example they're not firm enough they won't hold their shape they just look like gooey balls of peanut butter so just keep them on that hot tray for about 10 minutes and allow them to continue to cook so 10 minutes later i go back the tops are still shiny but when i get my spatula i'm able to pick them up because they're holding its shape and that's what we want so that is the time you want to transfer them to your cooling rack [Music] so mrs mcgreedy over here wanted to show you guys what it looks like to get a cookie before they're cooled completely you see that inside look they're not ready so just let them sit on that cooling rack five hours passed and i'm still mcgreedy because they smell delicious and i wanted a bite so i grabbed it and i broke it open just so you can see how well that they set up you see those peanut butter chips multiple peanut butter chips in that bite and also how you can pick them up throw them around they're plausible they're really good they're a melt in your mouth and i took it a step further because i'm extra and i grabbed a fork do you eat cookies with a fork no but this is the only way to really show you guys the texture and how they set up so nice well guys that is all for today i am so glad that you stopped by my channel please subscribe tell me what you think about the recipes i'll see you next around", "F7Nvd76Lres": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "38wYnB1ykbE": "hi I'm Sarah this recipe for peanut butter cookies is so easy you'll want to invite the kids to help and they make perfect lunchbox dessert I'm starting with about one and a half cups of crunchy peanut butter you could use smooth if you wanted to but this gives a really nice texture one cup of very tightly packed light brown sugar and I'm just going to mix this together in a bowl with a spoon if you have a handheld mixer or a standing mixer you could certainly use that one stick of unsalted room-temperature butter make sure that the butter is room temperature if you forget and you take it out a little bit too late you can put it in the microwave for a couple of seconds and that'll make it room temperature so this is going to be nice and creamy I'm just going to whisk together my dry ingredients it's a cup and a half of all-purpose flour one and a half cups and a teaspoon of baking powder a lot of baking recipes would add a little bit of salt to this mixture right now because I'm using peanut butter it has plenty of salts already in it you don't need any at all okay the last thing that's gonna go into this mixture is one egg just stir it right in until it's completely incorporated and then you're gonna slowly add these dry ingredients don't add them too fast because they might fly all over the place and just make a mess when I was in high school one of my favorite school lunches was Friday in fact it was the only day I bought lunch they used to have pizza and peanut butter cookies and I think I just got the I just bought the lunch just for the peanut butter cookies the last of the flour goes in gets a little bit hard to stir at this point so if you are doing with this with your kid they might need a little help right now I need a little help I'm going to make them pretty small about a tablespoon size we make lots of cookies here in the kitchen and one of our tricks is we roll them into balls place them on a baking sheet transfer them to the freezer when they're firm we store them in resealable bags and then we can have warm cookies whenever we want them just take a few out put them on baking sheet lined with parchment paper let them defrost a little bit for about 10 or 15 minutes and then bake them I'm making that telltale peanut butter cookie marking on the top using the tines of a fork I don't know why they always have that I guess maybe just to press them down because they don't really flatten so much when they're baking plus it just you know it looks nice if the tines of your fork start to stick a little bit just dip it in a little bit of flour the edges are gonna crack a little and that's okay too it sort of adds to the charm okay bake these until they're lightly golden brown and in a 350 degree oven that takes about 18 to 22 minutes depending these are perfectly golden brown just right around the edges and they'll firm up while they cool so don't worry if they're not completely firm at this point if you wanted to be really decadent you could drizzle them with a little bit of melted chocolate bittersweet or semi-sweet would be perfect and when they're completely cool store them in an airtight container for up to a week peanut butter cookies there's still one of my all-time favorites simple easy and delicious thanks for watching and we'll see you next time hi guys thanks for watching this video be sure to click here if you want to subscribe and click over here if you want to continue watching more great videos like this", "4itWJ6KkR48": "[Music] hey guys it's Michael from lean muddy lifestyle and today I've got a good recipe video for you guys I'm gonna show you how to make some low-carb peanut butter cookies now these are going to be really easy to make as you guys can see we don't have that many ingredients here so let's just go ahead and start and first off what we're gonna do is measure out one cup of natural peanut butter it just should be natural the only ingredients in natural peanut butter should just be peanuts and a little bit of salt but bottom line is you're just gonna measure out one cup of that alright so I've got the one cup measured out here and you'll notice with all-natural peanut butters that they're not as soft and it's easy to spread as the store-bought ones that are normally filled with chemicals and sugars and I could go on and on so I'm gonna soften this up in the microwave I'm going to stick it in there for 20 seconds just so it's a little easier to mix alright so now that this peanut butter is out of the microwave we're just going to go ahead and add that into our mixing bowl and then next up on our ingredient list will be two egg whites now you could use this shelled egg but I'm just gonna use some liquid egg whites today and the next up on our list of ingredients will be around three-quarters of a cup of stevia or Splenda or whatever you prefer now this step right here is completely optional I have a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder now if you wanted to use chocolate that's perfectly fine you could have a chocolate peanut butter combination but I'm gonna use vanilla today like I said this is optional but it will probably make it taste a little bit better and another optional ingredient that I'm gonna use today is one tablespoon of cinnamon so now that we have all of those ingredients in our bowl we're just gonna go ahead and stir it up alright as soon as you guys can see here I have everything mixed up in the bowl it smells really good but I really love the smell of peanut butter so what we're gonna do now is take a little bit of nonstick cooking spray go ahead and spray that on a cookie sheet and now what you're going to is just take a little bit of the dough and kind of form it into a cookie with your hands kind of like that and then you're just going to put it on the baking sheet alright so as you guys can see here I got around ten peanut butter cookies and now what I'm gonna do is put this in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit so these really don't take that long to cook so definitely keep an eye on it because you don't want them to burn and it's better to just take them out a little bit early then happen to be burnt but that's just me so I will see you guys in ten minutes when these are fully cooked alright so here we are I just took these out of the oven and as you guys can see they're completely done but I'm gonna put them on a plate to give you guys a better view and that right there is your final product we have some peanut butter cookies with a little bit of vanilla protein powder and cinnamon and some stevia and that's gonna taste really good so I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe if you did please like the video because it helps me out a lot and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it and also feel free to stop by my blog down below where you can find all my recipe videos organized in a list and I think a lot of you guys will enjoy that and I hope you enjoyed this recipe but I will talk to you guys next video bye [Music]", "sp-_3HDZay8": "chewy chunky crumbly chocolatey buttery coconutty a cookie is the perfect treat for any occasion and there are so many delicious recipes to choose from on today's show i'm going to teach you how to bake a few of my favorites these amazing breakfast cookies studded on top with dried banana full of goodness one should last you an entire day and coconut macaroons three different variations of delicious macaroons that are no longer just for passover and brown butter cookies these are utterly delicious rolled in glistening sandy sugar they're made out of browned butter and graham crackers have you ever made your own graham crackers well today i'm going to show you how stay tuned for today's martha bakes now how would you like to make a cookie that looks like this this giant cookie that is actually a healthy and delicious way to start your day this is called our breakfast cookie this recipe makes eight large cookies or 14 small and they have all kinds of delicious ingredients including dried mango papaya sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds raisins unsweetened coconut so start by creaming one pound of unsalted butter add three cups of dark brown sugar packed and a box of brown sugar has approximately three and a half cups of sugar so for this recipe i just take out a half a cup of sugar from the total amount now scrape down the bowl and then add four large eggs this starts off like pretty much any old cookie but then it gets more and more interesting let the egg get incorporated before you add the next egg and we have two cups of whole wheat flour i love storing my flour and my oats and my nuts in glass covered jars like this it's just a very handy way of easy storage easy access easy use two cups all-purpose flour and add a half a teaspoon of salt and one and a half teaspoons of baking soda and you can whisk these ingredients together so it's only four cups of flour but it makes so many giant cookies to your eggs and sugar and butter add one tablespoon plus one teaspoon of vanilla so i'll start spooning in the dry ingredients now you need a very strong mixer for this and this stand mixer is really really good for this kind of heavy duty cookie finish all the flour then add your oatmeal four cups of oats so speed it up you can take the bowl off and we will add all the dried fruits and nuts heavy rich very delicious this would be great for a bake sale okay so now we have to chop up the almonds finish chopping the papaya [Applause] thrown in with the rest of the papaya so all together oh approximately a quarter of a cup of papaya a half a cup of dried mango finely chopped half a cup of raisins half a cup of pumpkin seeds these are so great and a half a cup of sunflower seeds and a half a cup of unsweetened coconut and a cup of almonds just coarsely chopped make sure you get every almond chopped the whole almond would just be a little bit too large for this cookie there okay so this can go right into the bowl also and stir this up such fun now this is really too much for the machine to handle so i suggest doing just what i'm doing stirring everything in by hand but get way down to the bottom i see some coconut down there and then to form the cookies we'll clean up and get our pans out so i'm using this is a half cup measure this is a perfect measuring cup for the small version still makes a very sizable cookie and i think i can get maybe four on a tray notice i'm forming these on parchment and you could use a big ice cream scoop too if you so choose so these can be formed right on the parchment paper sort of like hamburger patties think of it that way you want them about the same thickness and about the same diameter and then stud the top with banana chips these are available also at the health food store wherever you bought your dried fruits looks good don't try to put more than three three really is plenty have your oven preheated at 350 degrees bake until golden and firm and that takes about 20 to 25 minutes so i still have a few more cookies to form i will do some large also and while i'm doing this you just take one of those cookies we already baked and taste it you'll love it don't tell anybody but this is a great breakfast a homemade cappuccino and a breakfast cookie like this really good now this is a cookie that i really love it's a traditional holiday treat macaroons you make them for passover they are gluten free they have a dense moist inside and they're crunchy on the outside and they are simply irresistible now i'm adding three and a half egg whites for two and a half cups of unsweetened coconut these are small eggs so i'm going to use a little tiny egg to just moisten the coconut you'll use anywhere from three to four eggs depending on the size and a pinch of salt so once the eggs are broken up add all the egg whites you don't want them too wet but you don't want them to dry one teaspoon of vanilla be prepared to use your hands be prepared to get your fingers full of macaroon have a bowl of water for your hands and you want to make these uniform size so i find the best way to do that with cookie dough is to use an ice cream scoop take your scoop this is a two tablespoon scoop and then just put it on the piece of parchment paper i think i will form these in my hands so you can make this dough yesterday it becomes a little bit more easy to use or you can just make them fresh like this and they're an unusual shape a little bit pyramidal and pinched but you don't want them too compressed because you want them to kind of melt in your mouth preheat your oven to 325 degrees and bake 16 to 17 minutes this will make anywhere from 9 to 12 macaroons now if you want to make kind of chocolaty ones you just add a half a cup of semi-sweet chocolate just stir it into the coconut that will make a mildly chocolate macaroon and then this one will be a very chocolatey macaroon four ounces of semi-sweet chocolate melted and oh cocoa powder a quarter of a cup of beautiful dark cocoa powder so this is the chocolate version you have to up the coconut to two and two-thirds cups of unsweetened coconut and use four large egg whites and that's a really rich macaroon so to show you what that looks like i'll show you i'll just make one of each better start with a light one it sticks together very nicely so that'll be a chocolate studded macaroon and this will be a chocolate macaroon now you can use sweetened coconut but if you're going to use the sweetened coconut then reduce the sugar from three quarters of a cup to one tablespoon i'll show you what they look like when they come out of the oven so this is what the macaroon looks like when it comes out of the oven this has cooled a bit but if you break into it you can see that it is moist and flaky and delicious and chewy it's what a coconut macaroon should be now i like to dip the point about halfway in melted semi-sweet chocolate and let that harden that is a wonderful dessert cookie now displayed on cake stands like this macaroons are fabulous look at the variety the chocolate chip the chocolate the plain and the chocolate dipped macaroons not just for passover anymore they're for every day just the name of the cookie brown butter cookies makes you want to make this cookie this kind of icebox cookie dates way back to the 1930s when electric refrigerators were gaining in popularity but what makes these cookies so special is the brown butter which gives them a subtle nutty flavor and i am making the brown butter right now it's 15 tablespoons of butter unsalted and you just cook it over a kind of a medium-low flame until the butter turns brown a bur noisette in french or hazelnut butter the brownness comes from the milk solids in the butter as it melts turning brown there is a fine line between brown and black burnt so be very very careful not to burn those little bits it takes oh maybe 10 or 12 minutes to do and we have one that's already brown and already cooled do you see the color it is perfect so now pour your butter into a large bowl and make sure you scrape out all of the brown bits this is the kind of butter that my mom would always put on top of her potato pierogies on top of her cauliflower steamed cauliflower it's just a delicious butter now in another bowl the dry ingredients a half a cup of granulated sugar and two cups of all-purpose flour it's nice to scrape the top like this just level it off so two cups and one teaspoon of fresh baking powder and a half a teaspoon of salt and just use your wire whisk to get this all mixed evenly now into the butter put two teaspoons of best vanilla extract and now you can just dump your flour right into the butter and stir it'll make a simple butter cookie now generally butter cookies are creamed butter and sugar and eggs and this has no eggs it really could be done all in one bowl too so this could be called the one bowl cookie it smells fantastic so this looks like a good consistency if you find that it is a little bit wet just add a touch more flour so here we have our beautiful moist dough and it has to be rolled into a cylinder that's 14 inches long and we've cut the parchment paper exactly 14 inches so you can make it a little bit flat to start and then we're going to roll it round we have a little trick we save all our paper towel cardboards and that will help keep this rigid and round while you're chilling it in the refrigerator and if you're proficient with one of these wonderful this is the bamboo that forms the sushi rolls this will help you really put a little bit of even pressure on your dough it works very nicely i watch all my favorite sushi chefs form their beautiful hand rolls and this really does work well oh it's perfect this way so now put this right inside your paper towel however if you have another piece of this bamboo you could wrap it in that and leave that in the refrigerator but you see this is just the right size and we can use a piece of tape to tape it and you won't have a cylinder of dough flopping around your refrigerator and this really has to chill for at least two hours and preferably longer until it gets nice and cold i like wrapping it in a piece of plastic wrap just so that the ends are covered and get that right into the fridge to chill so here's our chilled roll of cookie dough release this from the tube be very careful because it is dry and uh it can crack let's see how it looks oh it looks very good perfect so now with egg white just brush the whole surface make sure you cover the whole surface because you want the sanding sugar the sparkly sugar to stick to the outside of this roll and what i would do is just sprinkle the sugar right here on the same paper and roll the cylinder in this sparkly sugar you see how nicely it sticks so you'll have a nice sparkly edge to your cookies and then cut the cookies into a little less than a half inch i would say about 3 8 of an inch thick oh these are cutting perfectly if they're the right consistency they will cut just like this make sure your oven is preheated to 350 degrees and bake them until they are just slightly golden brown that's going to take anywhere from 15 to 17 minutes so this has to get right into the oven now you can roll the cylinder in colored sugar for holidays or finely chop nuts or even finely chopped dry candied fruit and the cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for at least three days but they're not going to last that long now these cookies will disappear immediately so you don't even have to think about how to pack them for storage they are really a beautiful delectable melt-in-your-mouth cookie and i just like to put them on a pedestal like this and see what happens they won't stay there very long i'm keeping a ready supply of this deeply nutty beautifully flavored dough on hand for instant sweet gratification keep a roll in your freezer take it out thaw it a little bit slice it bake it everybody will be happy [Music] enjoy now here's yet another fantastic cookie to make at home flat crisp and made with graham flour graham crackers can be used to make s'mores a crumb base for your favorite cream pie or they can be enjoyed simply on their own graham flower this is what it looks like it's kind of a grayish brownish color it's named after the american presbyterian minister reverend sylvester graham he was an early advocate for dietary reform and he had high hopes of diverting people away from the less healthy refined white flour so in honor of reverend graham we're going to show you how to make your own graham crackers and graham flour is whole wheat flour that is more coarsely ground so for the crackers themselves six tablespoons of unsalted butter a third of a cup of light brown sugar one tablespoon of best honey so good one egg cream that all together you can add a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and your dry ingredients three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour if you try to make these crackers out of all graham they would just be too strong tasting and pretty dry so that's three quarters of a cup of graham flour don't forget the baking powder a quarter of a teaspoon and a half a teaspoon of baking soda these work very well i make them every summer up in maine because i have an outdoor fire and we make s'mores and tell ghost stories and you need a half a teaspoon of cinnamon whisk that all together and add your dry ingredients this is a roll cookie you're going to roll the dough but we're going to do it between two pieces of parchment paper for very easy technique and now you can release the beater now i'll show you how to roll it out now have you ever wondered why graham crackers have holes in them well i have but it's really because when they're baking they need to release steam otherwise they would get bubbles in them and you want crackers to be nice and flat so here's the dough it's come together very nicely and we want to roll this out in a nice flat rectangle and rolling it out between these sheets of parchment really helps get it nice and flat and you're going to chill this until it's rigid and like pie dough you should really roll in one direction and then in another direction there that's nice put it on a cookie sheet you can put this right in the freezer and get it nice and rigid so now here is the stiff dough just peel away the top parchment and using a straight edge we are going to cut this into nice squares but dock it first this is a docking tool to make holes evenly spaced and this will keep the crackers nice and flat during baking and we're going to use for the edges this little pie cutter and pull away the little crumbs if you want to make some really pretty unusual desserts you can make star graham crackers you can do christmas trees for maine of course we're in the woods with spruce trees and here we have a nice cookie cutter but i am in the process here of making crackers and now we're ready to cut into squares so always start by dividing your dough in half and then in half again they are so beautiful and i think i can only get three out of it this way i will cut this into thirds that's pretty good so now get this right back into the freezer and get it rigid again and you're going to then bake them so here we have a batch that's very nicely chilled so what you want is just re-space these and get them right back on a cookie sheet and bake them on parchment in a preheated 350 degree oven for approximately 12 to 14 minutes and you can rotate the crackers halfway through the 12 minutes now if your cracker is sticking and these are sticking a little bit just take the offset spatula and run right under the cracker they come up nicely they release perfectly from the parchment and there just make sure you get these into the cookie sheet and into your preheated oven so here are the graham crackers and once you taste one of these crackers you'll never go back to the store-bought variety again and remember these are great for s'mores they're great for ice cream sandwiches they are great for dipping in milk and cut into animal shapes they would be the perfect animal crackers thanks so much for watching and i'll see you on the next episode of martha bakes set your timer [Music] looks really good tastes even better enjoy today's episode of martha bakes is all about bar cookies not only are these one pound wonders rich and delicious they're guaranteed to be best sellers at your big sale peanut butter and jelly bars a new take on an old favorite dark chocolate spilled brownies incorporating spelt flour and pecan bars these are my favorite pecan bars ever and dried fruit and nut health bars great for hiking all of this on today's martha bakes [Music] [Music] this recipe takes everyone's favorite childhood combination of peanut butter and jelly and transforms that combination into a sweet treat for all ages a peanut butter and jelly bar it's very easy to make we're using a 9 by 13 inch metal rectangular pan i'm buttering just the corners and a little bit of the bottom just so the parchment liner sticks and here's a way that we've always used parchment if you use two pieces of parchment cut it a little narrower than the length of the pan and put it like that let it hang over the sides and then this piece is a little narrower than the width of the pan whichever way you're looking at it and i've already buttered the corners so nothing's going to stick in the corners and just go to your desk and get a few binder clips to hold the parchment securely in place these work really really well so now you can butter the parchment with your soft butter and a brush it goes very quickly and the little pastry brush works very very well do the sides now we can start with the batter three cups of all-purpose unbleached flour and you can just put this flour right into a large mixing bowl and we'll sift it with your wire whisk i like sifting this way because it works very well one and a half teaspoons of salt this is a half teaspoon measure so i'll do it three times and one teaspoon of fresh baking powder mix these together and we're ready with the dry ingredients now the moist ingredients butter two sticks of butter one cup cream the butter and notice it's at room temperature so it creams quickly if you put ice cold sticks of butter in your machine it's going to take a long time to cream with the sugar one and a half cups of granulated sugar i'm adding it in half cup increments and add two large eggs now to this mixture add your two and a half cups of peanut butter and we are sliding the peanut butter into the bowl now the reason this is sliding out of the bowl is because i prepared the bowl a little bit with a little vegetable spray that helps these kinds of heavy mixtures like corn syrup molasses even peanut butter to slide out of the bowl and it's a good tip and now one teaspoon of good vanilla just add the dry ingredients on low it will all incorporate sprinkle a little bit of flour in the pan this will help the bar release make sure you coat the whole pan with the flour by doing this that works well two-thirds of this mixture goes right in the bottom and spread it out as best you can into a even layer so i like to use an offset spatula like this now getting it even makes a pretty bar so i advise you to do this carefully so see that's nice and flat now add one and a half cups of strawberry jam you could use strawberry you can use grape uh and you could use apricot those are my three favorites for this particular bar but i think strawberry is everybody's real favorite so get this atop the entire layer so now here i'm getting my hands dusted with flour because now i'm going to just drop pieces of the remaining batter all over the top and we're making our top layer which will be then sprinkled with chopped peanuts looks good don't you think so make sure your oven's preheated now at 350 degrees that's pretty much the layers and now the peanuts themselves sprinkled evenly all over the top try to cover up every little bit of jam there right into the 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes these have been well cooled remove the clips and see how nicely they come out of the pan this is such a good recipe and a good technique so utilize it when making something like this because otherwise this could be a sticky mess and how big would you like your square this is very very rich so i suggest uh small little rectangles so i always start in the middle serrated knife cuts beautifully and let's see i think i'll do this and third that'll give me six i better do this in fourths having a long serrated knife like this also helps a lot and there you have peanut butter and jelly delectable bars looks really good tastes even better enjoy now to chocolate the addition of spilt flour creates a real chocolatey depth of flavor in these crackly topped brownies made with bittersweet chocolate and we call them chocolate spelt brownies they're not only enticing but they are good for you as good as chocolate brownies can be so here's our chocolate six ounces of bittersweet chocolate when cut with a serrated knife it just breaks up into beautiful small pieces and these go right into a ban maria bowl over simmering water and with the chocolate add a half a cup one stick of unsalted butter keep this over kind of a low flame now add three quarters of a cup of light brown sugar packed and three quarters of a cup of white granulated sugar and a half a teaspoon of salt and stir this until it is nicely mixed okay so this comes off the heat and now we're going to add some cocoa and this is dutch processed cocoa and we need a quarter of a cup you want it rich and dark and preferably the dutch process where most of the butter fat is removed and now into this mixture we're going to stir three eggs three make sure that the eggs are completely incorporated and that there are no pieces of white or yolk visible it takes a little while for the eggs to become part of the mixture but they do doesn't that look rich and chocolatey now add your spelt flour spelt is a wheat flour you can buy spelt flour in fine to coarse grind and you can keep your spelt flour fresh by storing it in the freezer for up to six months it is a very very good substitute for all-purpose flour and it has a sweet and mild taste reminiscent to some people including me of toasted walnuts and it produces a very fine and delicate crumb in the cake we've added one quarter of a cup now we add another and all together three quarters of a cup of flour now a lot of people think that spelt flour is gluten free it is not gluten free but it is very low glycemic and that's a very different thing so there it is really beautiful batter so now fill your baking pan with mixture and this is the kind of brownie i prefer no nuts just brownie batter and it will get that nice shiny crust which is what i look for in a well-made brownie try to get it all in an even layer and put this right into a 350 degree oven when it's done about 35 minutes just check it with a cake tester and the tester will come out nice and moist with maybe a little tiny bit of a moist crumb on it set your timer so i'm just taking off the little clips and lifting out our gorgeous brownies now here's that crust i was talking about this is what you look for in a well-made brownie now how big would you like your square i keep asking that question i think maybe thirds so cut it in one direction oh boy these look so mouth-wateringly good now people are very fussy about which brownie they get that's mine right in the middle very important so good you see a very fine wet crumb dense that's a well-made brownie and you'll be very surprised as will your guests that this was made with spelt flour enjoy now my favorite of all bars pecan bars layers of texture to find these indulgent pecan bars with their crumbly brown sugar shortbread base and a chewy toffee like topping and of course beautiful fresh pecans prepare as i've shown you with the parchment paper and butter a nine by 13 inch rectangular baking pan now in a stand mixer cream two sticks of butter that's one cup of butter with three quarters of a cup [Music] of light brown sugar packed and a half a teaspoon of salt get that nice and creamy and add three cups of all-purpose unbleached flour this is going to be pressed into the baking pan it's basically a short bread and we're going to press this mixture into our baking pan good shortbread like this will look crumbly but be able to be compacted into an even layer okay so this is pretty even and now you can take a offset spatula like this and really press down now dock it docking is making little air holes in a surface just allow steam to escape there are such things as docking tools which you could also employ in this task but this works very well so now before you put this in the oven put this right into the freezer or the refrigerator and chill until it is firm so here's our beautiful crust it was baked in a 375 degree oven for about 20 to 22 minutes and it is a lovely dense beautiful base for our pecan bars and now i'm melting a half a cup one stick of unsalted butter with two tablespoons of granulated sugar a quarter of a cup plus two tablespoons of honey this goes right in there this is all the topping i'm sure many of you have made pecan bars in the past this just happens to be a really really good recipe which you will love and a half a cup of brown sugar i've been keeping it under wraps with a moist cloth so it doesn't get too hard a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and there is one more ingredient two tablespoons of heavy cream so get all these ingredients incorporated gets nice and smooth and caramelly and as soon as all of that is mixed together two cups of the best pecans that you can find fresh fresh fresh very important nuts get rancid really quickly and it is a shame to ruin a dessert salad anything with a rancid nut be very careful taste the nuts if you possibly can before you buy them and a half a teaspoon of vanilla and turn the heat off stir the nuts well to coat and this mixture goes right on top of your beautiful crust make sure you smooth this out so that the pecans are well distributed pecans if you don't know it are the edible fruit of a giant tree originating in the mississippi river valley in the united states and they are turned into pecan pie pecan tassies all kinds of candies garnishes for salads and most importantly right now for pecan bars when choosing pecans in their shell look for nuts that are really heavy for their size and make sure that the nuts do not rattle when you shake them they shouldn't have any holes or any cracks in them and if you're going to shell your own pecans look for a pecan cracker very different than the walnut cracker that you use in your hands or the lobster cracker this is a cracker that puts pressure on both ends of the pecan splitting the shell so that you get the perfect whole halves now get this into your 325 degree oven and bake until the filling is bubbling that takes only 15 to 20 minutes set your timer so i'm just loosening with a knife underneath so i know it comes apart from the parchment cut this into the bar size that you like this is again a rich rich bar i'm using a serrated knife so that it neatly goes through the pecans and you don't have to cut it all you can cut half and save half for tomorrow now that is a really pretty bar and arrange it on a serving napkin a serving platter buttery caramelly crunchy it's actually really pretty so they're beautifully arranged ready to serve these bars can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week i don't think they're gonna last that long they're sure to become your new favorite pecan bar enjoy i'm chopping one last ingredient of many for what we call the dried fruit and nut health bars these are delicious and i love going hiking and in maine i hike a lot with friends and i always like to bring along a healthy snack and these homemade energy bars are a better alternative to many of the packaged ones that you can find in the stores they're filled with nuts and dried fruits but the best part there's no added sugar it all comes from the natural dried fruits that are uh incorporated into the recipe now we have dates and we need one cup of dates pits have been removed very easy to remove a pit just spread the date in half and take out the pit we want to soften these and puree them so just cover with water and bring to a simmer the date is a fruit of a palm tree phoenix dakdelifera i love dates so much we have dried cherries a third of a cup of dried cherries these are dark black cherries and they are so delicious when they're dried like this we have blueberries papaya macadamia nuts pecans and all kinds of grains in this bowl one and a half cups of dried oats this is just regular oatmeal ground very fine in the food processor to that we add three tablespoons of ground flax seed everything in here is very very healthy found in the health food stores two tablespoons of oat bran in addition to the oatmeal two tablespoons of wheat germ i love wheat germ reminds me of my father every single morning he had a half a cup of wheat germ with non-fat milk cinnamon a half a teaspoon goes right in a half a teaspoon of salt the black cherries a half a cup of chopped toasted pecans a half a cup of ground toasted pecans just grind these in the food processor a quarter cup of finely ground macadamia nuts which are also lightly toasted and a quarter of a cup of just coarsely chopped macadamia nuts so you're getting macadamia nuts pecans and you have different textures coarse and fine third of a cup of papaya coarsely chopped a third of a cup of dried blueberries these are the little main blueberries so you don't have to chop those so this is basically it it's a very simple mixture of a lot of things so you have to do a lot of shopping but if you have it make sure you keep your oat bran and your flax seed in tight container tightly covered containers in the freezer to keep them absolutely fresh so now let's say the dates are plumped up you can drain them remember no sugars in these bars just the natural sugars from all these delicious sweet fruits so you can put this right into the food processor with the honey and you might have to use a little bit of that liquid and add a quarter of a cup of liquid from the dates that should be enough yes so what you're really doing is breaking up the fiber of the dates and making it into a nice paste if you looked hard enough you probably could find date paste but so easy to make your own there so so this is actually pretty dry i'm going to add a little bit more of the date liquid just to make this moist enough so that i can press it into a prepared baking pan press this nicely into your parchment lined baking pan looks so good and this will bake in a preheated 350 degree oven until the center is firm and the edges are golden about 20 to 25 minutes press firmly and get it right into the oven set your timer so who knew that something this healthy could taste so good i hope you've enjoyed today's show and don't forget to tune into the next episode of martha bakes bake these for your next hike i think it's my favorite cookie of the moment absolutely superb [Music] it's just the perfect cookie [Music] today on martha bakes i have four great cookie recipes for your cookie repertoire alexis's famous brown sugar chocolate chips really big really thin and really crispy and lots of chocolate chips and these are sadly cookies made out of potsoblay they are crispy and delicate and perfect for tea time and these big cookies well these are called old-fashioned sugar cookies very easy to make and these have a flavoring of lemon juice and lemon zest and in our cookie jar these are chewy chocolate ginger molasses cookies i think it's my favorite cookie of the moment absolutely superb these four recipes are my gift to you from martha bakes [Music] and now i'm going to make my favorite chocolate chip cookie it's alexis's brown sugar chocolate chips crispy and large and full of chocolate chips typical cookie ingredients sugar butter four sticks of butter one pound room temperature is good because then it really cuts down on the mixing time we're going to have put in one cup of granulated sugar and three cups of packed light brown sugar here we have our brown sugar make sure that the brown sugar is soft malleable so that can really be packed in and every now and then scrape down your bowl we're using that new blade that has the rubber edge which is very good for cookie batters and two teaspoons of vanilla best vanilla and that's nicely creamed we're going to add four eggs make sure you don't get any eggshells into your cookies very nice and creamy a little bit crunchy and now sift the dry ingredients we're going to do one and a half teaspoons of salt and the baking soda two teaspoons and we need three and a half cups of all-purpose flour one two three and i really like these cookies because they don't seem like they have a lot of flour in them they're very very thin mix this all up and two cups of best chocolate chips and we're using calibo which is made in belgium so add your flour on low speed now this dough once it's made goes into the refrigerator to chill and then it's easily scooped out with an ice cream scoop onto the baking sheet and if you're really organized you could actually make a lot of this batter ahead of time and keep it in packages in the freezer and two cups of chocolate chips this is 56 dark chocolate i like the dark chocolate in these this is a nice semi-sweet chocolate chip you could use milk chocolate if you like you could use even chunkier pieces are chocolate bits but for the true look of this particular cookie i think that this works very well we're going to put this entire mixture right into the refrigerator and chill oh for at least an hour i just wanted to show you chilled unchilled it really does darken that brown sugar starts to bleed into the rest of the ingredients so that goes right into the refrigerator and if you have a bowl of chilled dough i have found over the years that these black iron cookie sheets are really good i use them for puff pastry as well as for certain cookies i like what happens if you see the finished cookie here it has these concentric rings around they only seem to happen like that on a black iron tray like this i don't use parchment i don't use silpats i just do it on the black iron and these are available at really fine baking stores i have this size sort of half sheets and i have full sheets too and i'm using a three-quarter ounce ice cream scoop and just three cookies per tray you don't want these to run into one another you want beautiful round cookies one tray and make sure your oven is preheated to 375 degrees now there's no need to flatten these out they have so much sugar and so much butter that they flatten themselves out when baking there into the oven 10 to 12 minutes in the middle of your oven set your timer 10 minutes to check uh yes they look perfect there they are let them stay on the cookie sheet just a minute or two loosen them with a big spatula and cool the cookies thoroughly on cookie racks like this see how nicely they come up see how they've spread out thinly put on your next batch and get them into the oven so now i'm going to make an old-fashioned sugar cookie that's infused with lemon zest and lemon juice and it is really good three cups of all-purpose flour and it's a drop cookie so it's real easy to make dry ingredients all together in a bowl and we have one teaspoon of baking soda quarter of a teaspoon of salt whisk this together the whisking does lighten the flour and does eliminate any lumps if there happen to be any and in the bowl of a mixer you can soften two sticks of butter and cream the sugar in the butter one and three quarters cup of granulated sugar and a quarter of a cup of packed light brown sugar gives a nice color to the dough and an additional flavor as soon as the butter and sugar is creamy and it is you can add two whole eggs large eggs if you will and i've already zested the skin of a bright lemon we need one tablespoon of zest and we want one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice which will be approximately the juice of half of this lemon these are so great these lemon presses oh i just love them [Applause] now add your flour now the beautiful thing about this dough is that once made ready to bake so have your cookie sheets ready with parchment liners and that's the dough okay so now a flat scoop three per shee because they do spread and now you can just flatten that a little bit with the palm of your hand and sprinkle the tops with sanding sugar and then a little bit of water this helps the sugar adhere to the top of the cookie and then add a little bit more sugar and get this right into a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes set your timer well i think the cookies are done yes they are you can tell just by looking at them but a beautiful golden color so you can loosen them from the parchment put them on racks to cool they store very well they're delicious the next day and the next day and the next day they are an excellent cookie to add to your repertoire and now i'm going to show you how to make my favorite cookie of the moment it is the chewy chocolate ginger molasses cookie you need good chocolate i'm using a valrona bar we need seven ounces cut into chunks the best way to cut up chocolate is with a serrated knife i have found it really works extremely well and i'm weighing this chocolate that's going to be seven ounces that looks perfect and one tablespoon of freshly grated ginger very essential to the flavor of these cookies and into one and a half teaspoons of boiling water one teaspoon of baking soda that's all softened up and some freshly grated nutmeg just about a quarter of a teaspoon there are lots of aromatics in this cookie dough get these all ready now cream the butter one stick of butter half a cup of butter and you want a half a cup of dark brown sugar added to your butter and a quarter of a cup of white sugar get those ingredients nicely nicely mixed up and uh and now just kind of sift your dry ingredients one and a half cups of all-purpose flour plus one tablespoon of flour kind of essential and to those dry ingredients add your ground ginger one and a quarter teaspoons and a quarter of a teaspoon of cloves and the cinnamon one teaspoon and your grated nutmeg about a quarter of a teaspoon of nutmeg and one tablespoon of cocoa powder whisk this all together and into the sugar and butter you can add your freshly grated ginger and we need a half a cup of molasses now there's a little secret for getting molasses out of cut measures you can just spray with a little bit of vegetable spray and measure your molasses half a cup it should slide right out of the cup and i think we're ready to add the dry ingredients [Applause] [Music] with your water with the baking soda you can slide your molasses in slides out nicely that vegetable spray really does a good job scrape down the bowl and then stir in the chocolate and that's basically it now this dough has to chill before you form the cookies because it is very very moist but when you make it you'll see why i love it so much the smell the aroma the scent of all those spices and the fresh ginger and the cocoa and the molasses really really good and it's even better when it's baked into cookies so scrape it down this can be left in the refrigerator overnight and baked the next day you can scoop out the cookies onto cookie sheets and chill those too if you like but it is very easy and we have some cookie dough in the refrigerator i'll go get it and show you how to make the cookies using a one ounce ice cream scoop form these into rounds that makes 24 cookies so you're gonna need four cookie sheets if you're gonna do them all at once and these get put into the refrigerator and chilled until they're hard we have some chilled ones right here the oven by the way is preheated to 325 degrees for these cookies and we have some granulated sugar just roll the cookies in the sugar and put them right back on the parchment parchment is great if you haven't used parchment before it's a very nice addition to your kitchen these cookies would make kind of a mess on a cookie sheet this way this very little cleanup and get those right into the oven 325 degrees and they will flatten out i promise and here are the cookies you can see the chocolate's melted all around and they're all a uniform size which is really nice when you're trying to pack them up for gifts or store them it's nice to have that uniformity let these cool on the cookie sheets and then loosen them and put them on a rack and these chewy chocolate ginger molasses cookies are sure to become a family favorite try them i first published this recipe for sabzi cookies in 1982 in my entertaining book and i've been making them ever since and so have many many other people this is a french cookie made out of pat sable which is a sugary eggy dough that's used for tarts generally but it also makes really good small fluted cookies and the dough is made in the food processor you start with sugar two-thirds of a cup and just put that right into the food processor and one and a half sticks of butter pretty much room temperature but not real real soft and you can process this add two egg yolks to the mixture saving your egg white i always say save it for a meringue or a angel food cake these eggs are extraordinary and they will make very very yellow sably cookies now add a pinch of salt one teaspoon of vanilla and we're going to now also add some flour the missing ingredient [Applause] first one cup then another and it's all-purpose flour and now you can wrap the dough in a piece of plastic wrap and a nice rectangle this dough has to be chilled before you roll it out so here we have our dough just gather up the edges and flatten as you would pastry dough this will all come together nicely after it is chilled and here we have a square that's ready to roll out and we want to work with a third of the dough at a time so cover this with plastic wrap and roll very gently until it's about an eighth of an inch thick you can see how nicely it rolls now you can roll this out anywhere from a quarter of an inch thick down to about an eighth of an inch thick now this must chill so we're going to put this into the refrigerator and i have another piece that's already rolled out and chilled so that i can cut it with our cookie cutter space them apart the dough can be rolled again it's not as pretty or pristine as the first rolling but it works there once cut put them back in the refrigerator just so they're well chilled again oh even a half an hour is perfect and when you take them out brush the tops carefully with a little bit of egg yolk mixed with some water this egg yolk gives additional flavor to the cookie and helps the sanding sugar adhere to the surface you can bake these with or without additional sugar on top i just like how they look with the crunchy sugar love these cookies and this is a fine sanding sugar just lightly lightly sprinkle the tops and these go right into a 325 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes and this is what the sabla looks like when it comes out of the oven it's glistening it's tender it's just the perfect cookie and i'm just finishing stacking the four cookies that we have just showed you how to make different sizes different flavors served at a party you're gonna be a hero and i am going to cover it with my 19th century dome and keep them fresh until the guests arrive now that a pile of cookies enjoy for martha bakes", "pMOTxOugu7w": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back so today I'm going to be making my

for this week i did have three cake orders due today um they were picked up and gone i can insert a picture here of one of the cakes i did and then i did an order of cupcakes and another very simple cake so i'm just going to vlog what i do today and bake some cookies later on and i'm going to film that for you if you watch last week's video i'll link that above i talked about organizing and stuff i spent a lot of money at canadian tire on containers but i think i'm just going to go back to the dollar store and see what they have and see if i can come up with something to organize under my kitchen sink it's a bit of a mess so i am going to try and fix that and i really want to get into more organizing projects so i'm going to try and tackle my basement at some point because it honestly looks like a bomb went off i'm going to show you under the sink all right so under my sink is a mess as you can see i've tried to organize things in these two little bins i have the green bin under here some grocery bags back there and then a drying mat for dishes back here so i need to fix this situation and these bags so i'm going to run to the dollar store and see what i can get to fix this i also have the drawers over here in my baking side of the kitchen and this drawer is my spatulas and stuff and it is kind of organized but i need drawer liners i have some in here now but they're all scrunched up so i either need to get better grip drawer liners or get like a sticky tack or something to tack them down in the side so i'm going to try and fix this up because it's giving me a little bit of [Music] anxiety [Music] change of plans got back from the dollar store now i'm gonna go take chip for a walk so i don't have to do it in the dark later and my friend jen and i are gonna run to the mall and go for supper i'm back from sydney we went to the mall got a few things and we went to eat i got some stuff at winners and then this is from the dollarama from earlier so i will show you what i got when i went to the dollar store earlier i got um drawer liner it's just like the grippy stuff i also got this tape stuff it's called mounting tape i'm going to use it for something under the kitchen sink i got these containers i'm going to put this on the inside of the door under the kitchen sink i just don't know if it's going to bug me that this is going to hang out the edge it's all about the dollar store and then when i went to winners with jenna i found these little organizers and i got this spice rack thing i want to use in one of my cake cupboards here i'll probably show you what i do with that and then i got this from winners it's 12.99 and it's like two pieces i don't know if they're attached and they slide i think they're just two separate pieces anyways i'm gonna put this under the kitchen sink all right so i'm gonna take the packaging off of everything and then get to organizing some stuff it is currently 10 to 9 so i don't think i'm going to um bake anything tonight i might make some cookies in the morning and include that footage in as well but i don't really feel like turning the oven on right now so if you want to watch me bake some cookies later keep watching so i showed you under the sink earlier but i think what i'm gonna do is take everything out clean everything and then try to figure out what it's gonna look like after [Music] [Music] this is the after i put this on the door and it doesn't stick out too much it's nice to just have the things i use the most right there so it looks much nicer now and now i'm gonna move on to my spatula drawer so i'm gonna move on to this drawer i'm gonna start by taking everything out figuring out the drawer lining and then getting everything back in [Music] [Applause] [Music] i think this is much more organized than it was i added in this container and these two containers and swapped them out and i kept these regular ones because my little spatulas fit perfectly in there so i think this turned out pretty good now i'm gonna move to this cupboard i'm gonna try to do something different with the sprinkles and stuff so it's easier to [Music] access i changed this cover quite a bit i used to have um these this is two separate things for my piping chips i had one up here and one here but i ended up just putting them side by side i thought this would be in the way but i never actually take these out i usually just tip the drawer and get it in and i can get in all of these with my hand so and then i put some sprinkles that are in containers on a little spice rack i put colored sprinkles in here and then other special sprinkles like gold ones and stuff in this basket and i just think it looks a little bit nicer now i think i'm finished with the cupboards for tonight i might do a little more organizing tomorrow i have a lot of containers left and tomorrow i'm going to bake two different kinds of cookies so stay tuned for that before i go to bed i want to shout out my nephew nathan if you go check out his youtube channel nathan prendergast he makes gaming videos and other videos for kids so if you have kids or you want to see those videos go on over and check him out i told him i would do a shout out i always forget so go subscribe to nathan the link will be down below [Applause] [Music] all right it is sunday normally right now i'd be posting my youtube video but i procrastinated and i didn't make the cookies yet so we're gonna make the cookies but first i have to do the laundry [Music] [Music] i'm making peanut butter cookies i found this recipe on pinterest um i will link it down below for you the recipe says that it makes two dozen cookies um i doubled it because i want a bit more you can see all the ingredients back here i'm going to walk you through what everything is keep in mind that i doubled everything this is two and a half cups of flour a teaspoon of baking powder and two teaspoons of baking soda then one cup of packed brown sugar we have one cup of white sugar this is a cup of unsalted butter that i'm gonna soften in the microwave four eggs two teaspoons of vanilla the recipe calls for half to three quarters of a cup of chunky peanut butter so i did a heaping cup full two cups of oats some chopped peanuts i didn't measure these but it's probably about three quarters of a cup all right so it says in a small bowl whisk together the flour baking powder and baking soda so i'm going to cream together the butter brown sugar and white sugar until smooth next we're going to add the eggs vanilla and the peanut butter the recipe does call for chunky peanut butter i don't have chunky peanut butter so that's why i'm adding peanut pieces [Music] now we're going to add the flour a little bit at a time until incorporated [Music] [Applause] i added in the oats i mixed them in a little bit and now i'm going to mix the rest by hand so i don't over mix them okay so i have a dozen rolled out here on the tray um i still have a lot of batter left but i'm gonna pop these in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes like it says in the recipe just as like a test batch so i can change anything if i have to [Music] i just ate half of one of these peanut butter cookies and they're really good they're soft you see yum [Music] all right all the cookies are out of the oven and i'm actually going to melt some chocolate in this bowl i'm just going to heat it up in the microwave really quick and drizzle it over the tops of all the cookies [Music] [Applause] that wraps up this week's video if you enjoyed the organizing parts that i put in and the baking as well at the end please give it a thumbs up scroll down hit that subscribe button so you don't miss any new videos from me and i will see you next sunday you", "jdG_wqWDyp8": "today Kevin and I are to try some new Blue Bell ice cream it was 689 at Meijer it's half a gallon it's two ports it is the chocolate peanut butter cookie dough ice cream we have not had Bluebell in how many years please - Oh at least - at least when they had the big issues the issues yeah if you look up though Tammy dam Bluebell we've done all kinds of videos on Blue Bell ice cream is always one of our favorite Oscars yeah so I'm so happy to have it back in the area this one is smooth milk chocolate ice cream combined with tasty peanut butter cookie dough pieces and milk chocolate chunks sounds amazing half a pepper 82 grams it's only 200 I'm sorry 16 I don't think that's bad so I see peanut butter I've seen chocolate you see a little peanut butter peso you see a chocolate things you wanna do a really good you make less than that's not it okay I can feel the resistance I know you're getting stuff the whole way yeah so I'm gonna just we have had this sitting out for about 15 minutes not like that a mess it looks like you know I'm hitting hunks and like every scoop I'm hitting X which is good it looks like Wendy's frosting the chocolate look okay you can get that piece of the top there's so much chocolate it's hard to see it's hard to see the what's in it because there's so much chocolate big huh no cookie dough mm-hmm it had them in everyone that's what I got um I didn't get any chocolate not have a 100 chocolate and the paper now Riley was right next door that could be gone I like it if you like peanut butter cookie down you probably like this I've never considered a peanut butter cookie dough or P of our cookies in general that's sweet yeah they're not sweet cookie dough so I've never I'm just never really like wow could you know competing America Kida because you know you have to put sugar on them and so that just never was sweet so this is not another sweet arch burn and it's in my least favorite ice breath which is chocolate so this one's just okay for me if you love chocolate I think it's all agree with who Kevin said about peanut butter cookie dough fun I'll hover with it laughs it's just not sweet however you're putting it in incredibly sweet chocolate ice cream that chocolate ice cream is sweet since we just just for me it's just nothing I think it's delicious I think if you like cooking your peanut butter you're gonna like it if you like cookie dough you're gonna like it if you like chocolate chocolate chunks it's a good thing though that you don't like it so it's not a temptation thanks ray I mean I'm not saying it's it's bad my choice it's good ice cream Bluebell makes other ice creams that he would not be able to resist free sample the banana pudding but after exhausting the banana split is awesome I mean any of those kind it's just chocolate ice cream again my favorite peanut butter cookie dough not necessary my bad right a mint chocolate chip cookie dough my been a little mo been different you know but for me it's just not true choice I would go to but it is still good hmm I'm very very very good I like it I think you should try it I think you're getting a bargain 689 for half a gallon of oh boy within each packed full of stuff I mean I didn't have to like dig way down underneath till I started hitting stuff I started hitting stuff at the very very beginning so and this is all this is the same quality as like a Ben and Jerry's in the Ben & Jerry's is five four or five dollars for just alright yeah so you're getting a much better bargain if you buy the Bluebell so I'm gonna have a picture free event I know that I don't think you're gonna be able to see a lot just because the chocolate like I've said it's so dark and then the cookie dough this peanut butter so it's mix it in

to this so let's go with the nutrition label each one scoop contains four grams of fat six grams of carbs and 25 grams of protein and it also contains 5.3 grams of BCAAs now this protein is known to be um pretty it's fast digesting so it's mixed with concentrate weight and also weight isolated now um as you guys know marked lobe liner is infamous for his protein sludge so in my other videos I've made protein slowly with this protein and it's been amazing so I'm also a huge fan of peanut butter so let's see what this is gonna taste like alright it's going with the smell first smells more or less like chocolate cookies and cream I asked my any peanut butter flavor I also see cookie bits in there so that's from the cookies and cream so it's very similar to the cookies and creams so again today I'm gonna review with eight ounces of water and I went with eight ounces of almond milk so I'm gonna put one scoop of each so let's go all right so not one scoop of weight in with the water and one scoop of weight with almond let's shake it up with the water first nice new shakes again they should be a little bit more thinner than then the pea science because this is not casein so it's shifting thinner as you can see already there there eat cookie bits on the bottom so cookies and cream using legit cookies alright no clunks just some you tell it's really thin see I'm moving let's try it out Wow this is rich um it is super it is very tasty it is very rich um you can taste the chocolate and the cookie bits in there you can definitely taste the cookies and cream aftertaste but the peanut butter taste is very very light I wouldn't say it's very strong it's not overwhelming i'm--you're to me at least I have to really try to look for it I'm forgetting that this is peanut butter cookies and cream I'm just thinking this is regular cookies and cream alright let's give it a shake with the almond milk now now let's try this out now alright doesn't look thick 19 thin I'm expecting this tastes a little bit better because I'm usually mts weight goes better with milk but let's give this a try no clones on the top no clumps on the bottom just a little cookie bits mmm it definitely tastes creamier and also um smoother if it makes sense so you could you could taste more of the peanut butter with the almond milk it's sweeter compared to the water I mean it's tasty with the water but you really don't taste the peanut butter flavor it's just most of the cookies and cream but with the almond milk you got you taste um the extra sweetness from the peanut butter god I love the cookies and bits all right so my verdict would I recommend this to be honest um I probably wouldn't get this flavor again because not because it's not tasty it's very tasty but I'm aiming for more of the chocolate peanut butter cookies and cream flavor and this tastes very similar to the regular cookies and cream I mean the taste of peanut butter is like very hint so um if you're if you want to go over to peanut butter flavor I would kind of recommend something else um either go with the PD science or also go with legion peanut butter um this just don't really taste much like the peanut butter flavor you only taste more of the cookies on the cookie the cookie bits from the cookies and cream so I would get this you want to try it out but if you really want something with a very very strong peanut butter flavor um this is not the one to go with but it still very tasty I mean it's good with water and it's good with the milk um it's today nowadays it's very rare to find protein

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "u9jrh4Xe1SI": "[Music] hi everybody thanks a lot for dropping by are you without flour well and do you want to bake cookies well I think this is maybe one of the most perfect recipes for you this is peanut butter cookies it's got four ingredients and one of them is not flour so I'm gonna bring you down I'm gonna show you what's in it and we're going to get started okay I have here some peanut butter now I use natural you know without the all those a different you know additives you're welcome to use like a jiffy or a Skippy or whatever it is you use but this is a this I'm using a smooth you could use chunky if you like so we're starting off with some of that and of course I will give you the ingredients measurements and the you know the instructions down in that box down below that says show more so in here is going to go some granulated sugar and some brown sugar break that up a little bit in there and I have some baking soda just a little bit of that and I also have this was unsalted peanut butter and I'm just going to add just a really a pinch just to give it a little bit of saltiness because this recipe you know I think really caters to peanut butter that's got some salt in it anyway I'm just gonna get what I want to do here is just kind of mash up that brown sugar a little bit okay now comes a beaten egg if you'll remember and I will put a link up above I froze eggs and this is one of my frozen eggs so in goes that what'd I tell you about this recipe is this crazy or what and a little bit of vanilla extract and now I am going to mix it all up and we have cookie dough and once I have this thoroughly mixed I will bring you back and here we are it took me I don't even know why I turned the camera off it took so little time now this is all mixed in as you can see it's really a thick paste I wouldn't call it a dull I'd call it a paste and it's going to absorb some of that sugar that's in there so it'll dry out just a little bit but this is it this is all we need to do next comes the cookie sheet all right now I have my oven set at 350 degrees and these are gonna cook for about 10 minutes so as most peanut butter cookies go you see if I can made me move that out a little bit so you have a little bit of you that's going in we don't win we want it there we go that's much better for you okay so it you know what like most cookies you know you're just going to take a scoop of it you can do it in a bowl I mean a spoon or like I use you know an ice cream little ice cream scoop and you're going to just roll the cookie like you normally do with peanut butter cookies to put it in a little white sugar there put this here so you can see it well a little bit of granulated sugar and I'll show you these too and then I'll fill up the fill up the tray here so you know you just take a fork this is very traditional look of a peanut butter cookie right and those are going to go in the oven and I'm going to fill up the cookie sheet and we'll be back and here we are this is a dozen cookies on this sheet one thing I wanted to tell you a little tip I do is I roll them all and dip them in the sugar and then just lay the balls all on here and then press them all at the same time it you know it it makes it a little more streamline alright I'm going to put these cookies into the oven as I said 350 degrees on that metal rack and they should cook 8 to 10 minutes you know you don't want to overcook them you want a nice and chewy so they may not look as well they look golden brown don't let him get too Brown I'll show you what they look like when they're done and we're then I will let them cool on the cookie sheet for about five minutes and then move them on to a cooling rack that five minutes on the cookie sheet really helps you know set them if you were to try and take them off you know right after they come out of the oven you'll probably have some problems you know they'll break apart anyway we'll be back when these are done and I'll show you what they look like and then we're going to taste [Music] what a surprise there's food and the director ah I can always count on you yes these I can't wait living Italy be holding that pic I know I should sit there who is that just beautiful it doesn't smell so nice there is schooi most like a chocolate or peanut butter cookie there's no flour in there you're kidding hmm Wow seriously delicious and I'm an expert on peanut butter cookies hmm I love the texture I do too there's a texture there's a little crispness and yet it's soft and chewy and that peanut butter just goes towel isn't it mm-hmm excellent cookie it made this by the way this recipe made actually exactly two dozen cookies I know I mean I still have 22 cookies to eat and I would say this is a two and a half inch cookie diameter when you say children yeah knows how she's crowding me all the picture did I really oh I'm sorry so anyway this is a great recipe I have done one similar to this and I actually think it had three ingredients I can't recall this one of the better peanut butter cookies joven there's a real creaminess thing happening wasn't sure yeah I hadn't tried this one I had tried another one that was similar to it and and look how easy it is there's no flour okay so it's gluten-free you don't have to have worry about not having flour and you're covered like a lot of us are doing and peanut butter most people have now in their shelves because you know peanut butter is a good thing to have these are better than Nutter Butter oh yeah yeah all right well listen this is a go-to thumbs up and I will again put the recipe and the description down below on how you make it now there's a little box down this show me you click on that and it'll drop down on a box and you see the recipe there and I'm gonna try and counter out of another cookie will to that can I say alright everybody thanks a lot for watching let me tell your friends oh thank

hip-hop group tag team to help you plan dessert [Music] switch today and see all the ways you could save", "LMj97nATpK8": "hi guys welcome back to my channel today i'll be showing you how to make three ingredient peanut butter cookies it's a super fun and easy recipe plus they're delicious first preheat your oven to 350 degrees which is 175 degrees celsius next line two cookie sheets with parchment paper okay so tools you will need is a one cup measurement a cookie dough scoop spatula to scrape the bowl a stand mixer um if you don't have a stand mixer you can just paddle it by hand but i wanted to use the stand mixer just for fun so i'm gonna use the stand mixer and for the attachment i'm going to be using this i think it's called a paddle but i'm not sure but it's this thingy looks kind of like a wonky pretzel and here are the ingredients you will need um i'm going to be doubling the recipe so i'm gonna have peanut butter this one's halfway gone so i thought i might as well get two out because i'm not sure um sugar and eggs so let's get cooking so it's time to combine our ingredients first i'm going to add in two cups of sugar white sugar so here's where that spatula comes in hand and you can scoop the peanut butter out of the container and just kind of flop it into the cup okay the harder part is scraping all the peanut butter into the bowl ah the camera's slipping there we go [Music] so now we add in two eggs and again i'm doubling the recipe so i'm adding two of everything like two cups and two eggs obviously and now i'm gonna put this in the mixer all right so we're gonna put this oh it's right put the attachment on or should i do that after i'll do it after so yeah you put the ball in and place it and then attach the attachment now put it on stir and i'll show you a view of how it looks in there so as you can see it's coming together okay so that's honestly i'm just going to use the same spatula that has peanut butter on it because it all goes in the same i'm going to scrape off this attachment because it's covered in the dough and take that out for just a moment and scrape down the edges so that all the stuff can still get incorporated because you want any raw eggs or sugar or peanut butter on the sides that are not mixed in so now i'm just going to put it back on the same stir [Music] until it looks kind of like this and it's all incorporated so i'm gonna stop stirring it and take it out and start putting it on the cookie cheeks all right so we're gonna pour some sugar in a small bowl i don't know how much i get exactly just like fill it up that much i'd say so you can we're just gonna roll the cookies in this and yeah all right so take a scoop of cookie dough or yeah and then put it into the sugar just roll it around and stick it on there now you don't want to touch this too much because it'll melt down and make it kind of hard to work with and then honestly i'm just going to put it in the sugar bowl that'll be easier [Music] right now these look done but they're not quite done so you take a fork and squish down slightly and make a crisscross design i'll give you an overview of that so you can have a better view okay so you're just gonna make a crisscross design with the fork by smashing down one end not too hard and then doing it again kind of like a tic-tac-toe board um i don't know really why you do this i think it's to help it cook evenly but honestly i'm not sure i'd have to look it up it is now time to put the cookies in the oven so we're gonna bake these for six to eight minutes when it says like six to eight or something to something like 11 to 12 or something 11 to 13. i usually do the number in the middle so i'm going to do seven minutes and yeah all right so now that our cookies are out of the oven i'm gonna start taking them off and putting them on a cookie sheet but you should let them set for a few minutes if you just got them out of the oven because they should you should be able to hold them like this and they won't fall but if they're like floppy then it's not because it could be because you undercooked them but um it could also be because they haven't sat long enough because these are the kind of cookies that you just sit for a minute after they get out of the oven to firm up i don't know why but it's just the kind of cookie it is so with cookies there's not really much to plate in fact you don't even need a plate so i'm just going to grab one and do the taste test so yeah all right moment of truth so one two three delicious [Music] do [Music] bye guys thank you so much for watching this video i hope you subscribe to my channel and like this video i'll see you next time bye so i know that lots of the world says don't eat raw cookie dough but it's good you saw nothing one two three delicious one two three delicious", "gAKlFD7L2js": "hello and welcome to my kitchen for today i'm going to be baking peanut butter cookies did you know that pampered cookies have been around for about 100 years the recipe was generated in the 1910s became popular in the 1920s however it wasn't until the 1930s when the fork was used for that signature grid pattern that we know on peanut butter cookies today however i like to cheat a little bit and i use a potato masher still gives the same grid pattern but it's a lot easier to stamp a cookie than having to go through and making sure you've got all of your tongs just right and here are the ingredients that we will be using for today's recipe we will need salt peanut butter unsalted butter flour an egg brown sugar white sugar vanilla baking powder and baking soda as always before baking or cooking i like to pull back my hair and wash my hands first you will need half a cup of butter softened if yours is like mine and just came out of the fridge you can also melt it next you need half a cup of brown sugar and make sure to pack the sugar down now the butter is melted as a side note if you would prefer to use margarine instead of butter you can do that next you will want to add half a cup of white sugar so the sugar should be half a cup of brown and then half a cup of white now add in your sugar and stir next you'll want to add in one egg next add in one teaspoon of vanilla next add in 3 4 a tablespoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of baking powder now if you're like my husband and you like your salt here is where you can add in 1 4 teaspoon of salt but that's optional and now stir [Music] and now time to measure out one cup of peanut butter okay now add in your peanut butter now time to stir in the peanut butter last but not least is measuring out one and a half cups of flour and i like to use a knife to remove the excess flour and i'm using a flat edge of the knife okay put in your one cup of flour and go ahead and stir that you'll find this will become very thick so it's easier to split up when you put in the one cup and then put in a half a cup of flour later now for the half a cup of flour once you have all of the flour mixed into the batter then you'll want to chill the mixture for at least 30 minutes so while we wait did you hear the joke about the peanut butter well i'm not going to tell you you might spread it for your cookie sheet you can either line it with parchment paper or if not that then spray it with nonstick cooking spray so i'm just taking a regular small teaspoon here and what you're going to do is you want to make about one inch balls so i've got in my hand here and i'm just going to roll it the dough around in my hand like that and after you've rolled out your cookie go ahead and lay it down on the sheet and if you're if you think your cookie is a little too thick you can go ahead and pick off a bit and then go back to rolling it once you have your cookies rolled out next you want to press them first i'll show you with the fork so you'll press down one way and then you'll want to slide your fork off and then press down the other way and then slide your fork off so again press slide your fork and then press slide your fork if you prefer to use the potato masher all you do is press and press bake your cookies for about 10 minutes once the cookies come out of the oven i have laid down foil with the shiny side down and i've got my spatula ready before you move the cookies onto the foil you will want to let them cool on the cookie sheet first you want to make sure the bottoms of the cookies have a nice golden brown to them once the cookies have cooled on the cookie sheet then go ahead and transfer them to the foil and then you can load a cookie sheet with the next set of cookies to be baked in the oven so here's the cookie with the fork tongs and here's a cookie with the potato masher these cookies smell and taste delicious thank you for watching if you have any questions please feel free to ask and [Music] subscribe", "4UIhOEQDnfw": "sometimes for whatever reason you just aren't feeling it and uh the solution can be as simple as a batch of cookies today we're gonna make some cookies that are going to bring a smile to everybody's face stick around for this special swirl cookie you're not going to want to miss peanut butter and chocolate yum stick around bags the oxygen is really what deteriorates medicine so you so uh you think we got enough flour for that i don't know it might be a little short for this recipe that needs two and a quarter cups yeah maybe you've got it there so for this recipe you're gonna make a dual dough you're gonna make a peanut butter cookie dough and you're gonna make a chocolate cookie dough and then it's gonna have chocolate chips in it okay and so the two and a half cups of flour is that just for one of the doughs or is that for both those both one of them has one cup of flour the other has one and a quarter cup of flour oh okay how many cookies is this supposed to make it says 24. 24 cookies so what's up it's a small batch only 2 only two dozen cookies he'll eat those in one setting looks like you cream the butter and sugars together um first yeah we've got one stick of butter and we're gonna do a half cup of white sugar and a half cup of packed brown sugar you ever thought about why you have to pack brown sugar why does it have to be packed because most of the recipes you do say to pack brown sugar i would just wonder why i don't know just always been a thing maybe somebody can tell us any of you know if you know why you have to pack brown sugar please tell us in the comments i'd love to know there we go okay then we're supposed to cream this until light and fluffy oh well i love this mixer how long have you had that mixer oh probably 18 years yeah we've been married 23. can i buy for you for anniversary you bought it for christmas or birthday or something i'm not sure which but it was not she hated it she was so disappointed when i got it she was like i don't want appliances for my gifts oh i don't know now you love it don't you i love it yeah it's great it's worn out though this piece it won't even it won't even lock any more stroke okay so we started the other dough and now we're starting the second dough oh still the first dough oh this is so we're starting with the chocolate though it's got to cool doesn't it it's got to be refrigerated for um two to three hours it's six o'clock in the evening we're not gonna be eating cookies until late well you're the one that came home and said hey let's make cookies they sounded good didn't they the picture looks really good half cup and two tablespoons and then the baking soda and salt one teaspoon of baking soda half a teaspoon of salt break down the size and then add an egg yes scrape down the sides so you get all that goodness in there and then add an egg and vanilla i believe how much vanilla chicken see on there i think it might be one teaspoon that's why i printed the recipe i don't feel like doing this so i scrape down the uh edges of the bowl one egg and then one teaspoon of vanilla and then you blend that well huh mix that mix and then go back over here to the dry ingredients and you're gonna do one teaspoon of baking soda in that flour and cocoa one teaspoon yes this says you can use it are they both in here yeah i don't know why they're shaped differently but they are all right one teaspoon and then something else salt i think look on there i think it said a half a teaspoon of salt okay okay i think that looks about right it's real soft [Music] all right so what we're doing now mixing this uh dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix it it says it will be really thick okay and then so i panicked a little bit and i didn't think that this was going to come together and it is coming together and it is the instructions say it's gonna be really thick and it is a really thick batter i didn't think there was enough moisture in it but it's it's doing all right so after we get our thick batter which is very very thick almost like a brownie batter and we're going to add two tablespoons of milk and the chocolate chips so and hand mix that and this floppy spatula off while you do that i'm going to do this tastes like fudge brownie yeah okay so now we're gonna hand mix this how many chips one cup all right we're getting that one cup of chocolate chips in there some chocolate in my life why are you videoing me these are these are these are these are these are to be so rich my goodness yeah that looks like it'd be good by itself yeah i wonder if us using natural peanut butter is going to make a difference in this recipe well i thought that too it's a little um the natural peanut butter is looser like you know kind of more liquidy yeah i don't know so i transferred this chocolate cookie dough into a glass ball and mark said it needs to go in a plastic bowl what do y'all think i thought glass would be easier for the dough to slide out of okay now we're ready to make the peanut butter cookie dough and we're gonna do the half cup of butter half cup of brown sugar and a fourth cup of white sugar so here goes the half cup of brown sugar and we have a fourth cup of white sugar turn the mixture on and beat this until it's like fluffy all right the peanut butter that we have is a natural peanut butter so i'm not sure if that'll alter what happens in the recipe or not but we'll see we're going to do 3 4 cup of peanut butter 1 egg and a teaspoon of vanilla alrighty here goes this uh peanut butter put it in the natural peanut butter is got more oil in it it seems like and maybe less sugar so i'm not sure if that'll be good or bad for this actual cookie recipe we'll see i'm gonna have to scrape that out all right so we got the peanut butter down in there turn it on it says mix uh these next three items one at a time into the sugar and butter so we'll do peanut butter first next we'll do an egg [Music] here goes the egg let that one get mixed in good [Music] in goes the vanilla that's one teaspoon we'll mix that up after this we add some baking soda and flour now it says we're gonna do one and a quarter cups of flour i'm using a quarter cup measuring cup so i'm just gonna do five of these okay mix that up it says do not over mix at this step so we're gonna mix that flour until it's all incorporated and go ahead and add the baking soda so we've got a we have not over mixed it hopefully um it is very thick oh so now i'm going to add the chip chocolate chips and stir it in we also use a cup of chocolate chips and this recipe this uh peanut butter cookie recipe so i'm going to try to get this started even though it's really really thick but it says it'll be thick so i guess that'll be okay all right so i'm gonna cover this with plastic wrap and um let it all chill for a little while all right so now we wait for the dough to chill in the fridge it says two to three hours three is preferred i don't know how long we'll make it it's about six oh it's seven so uh it does say you could chill overnight so we may just um end up uh making these tomorrow we'll see cookie dough is chilling and we're gonna start the timer for two to three hours stay tuned all right it's been a couple hours so we're gonna pull this out of the fridge and make some cookies here's our peanut butter and it looks good i bet it's going to taste good we're going to make some a ball of each and smoosh it together to make one big cookie so i'm going to make all the balls of chocolate and then all the balls of peanut butter separately and then put them together okay we've got a plate of peanut butter cookie and a plate of chocolate cookie balls and so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take one of each and it says to roll it into a ball together and the peanut butter cookie is kind of dry falling apart so i don't know how that's gonna turn out and they're really huge i said two tablespoons per ball but i really did less than that like a little bit less because and i it said 24 cookies on the recipe and i ended up with 21 of each fall so we'll see okay since these are so big i only put six on a pan and it says to bake for 11 to 15 minutes at 375 so we're gonna put those in the oven and they're in the oven so we're gonna set the timer for 11 minutes see how they turn out all right we're going to pull these babies out and leave them on the pan for a little while to cool that's what it says to do these are soft baked cookies so they're supposed to be a little bit undone on you know when you pull them out is what it said hey hey well how is it really good let's see oh yeah yeah yeah these are good it's done even though it looks undone oh good um because the chocolate melted in there there's chocolate everywhere oh yeah i gotta have some milk so what jessica's been telling me is that the chocolate is really sticky and the peanut butter is kind of crumbly and she didn't think that it was gonna work when she started putting these cookies together but these cookies are absolutely amazing they're fantastic don't get discouraged if your peanut butter dough is just a little bit crumbly and your chocolate seems a little bit sticky that's normal and these cookies turned out terrific", "Rj22GOgZ67M": "okay all of these did you see that today we are making peanut butter cookies they are extremely peanut buttery very fudgy and soft and comforting and we're doing it in as few ingredients as possible we only need three things we don't need any flour we also don't eat any measuring cups or spoons so what you need to get started is one jar of peanut butter one jar of jam and two eggs so i'm using a creamy peanut butter here if you want some chunky bits use a chunky peanut butter that'll work great too all right this is the hardest part of the recipe getting every last bit okay so we don't even have to wash our peanut butter spoon because all of the jam is going in i'm using apricot jam you could also use peach jam i bet fig would be really good what i aim for here is something like orangy as a bonus because it's the same color as the peanut butter but you want something that is like pretty mild in flavor this way the jam is just serving as a source of sweetness for the cookie it's not so much that you're getting that overt fruity flavor so in this case the whole jar of jam is taking the role that granulated sugar or brown sugar would normally play in a three ingredient peanut butter cookie or really any peanut butter cookie obviously there's sugar in the jam when it's made but it's mostly fruit so you get this jammy kind of fudgy gooey texture to the cookie that you wouldn't have gotten quite in that way otherwise and you also get all those bonus flavors from the fruit this is good it looks wrong but it's right this cookie dough kind of looks more like a batter like a muffin batter or cake batter the reason for this is because we are ending up with a soft pillowy tender cookie uh not something that's like crispy crunchy so now i'm gonna scoop it i have a like a tablespoon size scoop but if you don't have one just use two spoons it totally doesn't matter i'm just going for heaping tablespoons so it's kind of overflowing from the cup then i'm going to scoop it down onto a silicone mat something just to prevent it from sticking to our pan these don't spread too much so maybe space them like inch and a half apart i'm just adding a a flaky salt on top of each cookie if you don't want the extra salt don't use it we didn't put any salt in the batter because the peanut butter is salted so that was like doing double duty its own way i can't get enough so i'm just gonna add a tiny bit more it's nice it's a little bit texture kind of looks like sprinkles honestly i bet if you added some pepper on top that would be really good too but that's for you to tell me but i better be really good should we have a cookie hmm which is a good batch it has a very fudgy very jammy very gooey belly with a kind of cakey exterior but overall it's just really soft and pillowy and tender kind of like a hug in a cookie subscribe to our youtube channel so we can cook together again next week we have another three ingredient recipe coming up but very different very savory very good so i'll see you then [Music] you", "aOemXjNW6oY": "how to make peanut butter cookies without sugar almost everyone is a sucker for

flatten them and use a fork to make the signature cross hair pattern on each of the cookies make sure to space the cookies 2 inches apart so they do not stick to one another once they expand 8 bake for 10 to 12 minutes 9 take the cookies out of the oven and let them rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely now that you've learned how to make peanut butter cookies without sugar you can start looking at other cookie recipes and try to eking them by substituting sugar with honey or other sugar substitutes for healthier cookies", "plN9qsKnTYA": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back to my channel peanut butter cookies let's bake some in my goal I have 1/2 of a cup of salted butter and 1 cup of unsweetened peanut butter of course you can use unsalted butter if you like and you can use any brand of unsweetened peanut butter that you choose let's cream together our fats the facts of the creamed together I have 1/2 of a cup of packed brown sugar and in this little milk here I have 1/2 of a cup of granulated sugar kind of looks like a blob of poop covered in snow dumped in the sugars and mix it up here I have 1 large egg that I've whisked up dump it in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract mix it all up now it's time to add in our dry ingredients I like to put them all through a sifter here I have one and a half cups of all-purpose flour here I have a half a teaspoon of salt a half of a teaspoon of baking soda and a half of a teaspoon of baking powder [Music] simply that clumps mix it up I don't know about you but my peanut butter cookies I like to divide the dough in half keep half of it for plain peanut butter cookies and then add chocolate chips to the other half of the dough here I have a quantity of chocolate chips I don't believe in measuring chocolate chips so add whatever amount you like cover and chill for at least one hour the reason why I like to chill the dough for at least one hour is because these cookies have a very high fat content and if you bake them right away what will happen is that they will spread way too much and be too thin and that's not what I want so you can chill the dough if you like or you can make them right away that they won't turn out the same I can't tell you what to do the bill has Scheldt for one hour and I could turn my oven on to 350 degrees and it has preheated ready to bake [Music] form the dough to relatively small balls one inch in size lightly flatten not too much though and place on your prepared pans I had Wi-Fi pan with parchment paper using a fork I like the crisscross the tops press in one direction lock in the cookie just a little and then going in the opposite direction only clip eight per pen as these cookies will still spread I like to give them the additional room these cookies will bake between 10 and 12 minutes I find that mine bake for 10 minutes exactly I placed the oven rack right in the middle it's been 10 minutes they have a beautiful golden-brown edge on them so I know that the bottoms are the same color I'm gonna let these cookies sit on the pan for a couple minutes and let them cool a little bit before I turn them over to the counter because they can be a little bit delicate once they're first out of the oven so I highly recommend just letting them sit on the pan for a couple minutes to stabilize [Music] Oh peanut butter and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies hope you enjoy this recipe don't forget to Like share and subscribe to my channel do you prefer plain peanut butter or peanut butter chocolate chip let me know in the comments section enjoy see you next time [Music]", "L3P5jyQFprU": "let's make some ooey gooey choco peanut butter cookies take some powdered peanut butter some cocoa powder some salt

oh feel free to spice this recipe up with some chocolate chips yup another one peace", "egwSVNvYF-Q": "[Music] hi guys it's mano and welcome to a new video today we're going to be making three ingredient peanut butter keynote cookies peanut butter can be a little controversial on the keto diet and that's okay if you wait till the end of the video I'll explain everything there is to know about peanut butter and keto and low-carb lifestyles are you ready these are the ingredients 1/2 a cup of natural peanut butter it's very important when you're buying peanut butter for the only ingredient in the label to be peanuts this has no sugar at it and it's creamy normally I wouldn't mind if it was a little chunky but for this recipe I really recommend creamy peanut butter 1 egg yolk 1/4 cup of erythritol or any other powder or granular sugar replacement in a lot of recipes it's okay if you use liquid stevia or another kind of sweetener but in this recipe says since it's only 3 ingredients it's really important for it to be granular or powdered here I'm using erythritol but actually my favorite sweetener is monkford so here we have the creamy peanut butter I measured it out in the bowl I was going to use so I wouldn't dirty up too now I'm just getting the egg yolk what I usually do is use the egg shell to split it up and then I just can use the egg whites for any other peace now I'm gonna put the egg yolk here mix it well add the quarter cup of erythritol and mix it we're gonna find um that the mixture is gonna get dry or drier really quick and that's the texture we want for for our cookies [Music] so after a couple of seconds it already looks like cookie dough we're going to mix it well and this is going to yield six cookies if you like smaller portions you could also apportion area it out to eight or ten cookies for calorie control right now we have the oven preheating at 350 Fahrenheit [Music] so what I usually do to split up the dough is in the bowl with my spatula I just visually divided into however many pieces I want so this is six pieces and if I have to correct the portion of the cookies that's fine I can do it as you can see the cookie dough it's really easy to handle it's gonna stick a little to your fingers but nothing major [Music] at least so now we are simply doing the classical peanut butter cookie look with a fork I just crisscross them and they're gonna go in the oven for about 12 minutes and they'll be ready [Music] so it's it guys super quick and easy amazing keto peanut butter cookies less than 15 minutes to make from start to finish and three ingredients we have peanut butter we have the egg yolk and we have some kind of powder or granular sweetener and this time this time I use erythritol I have to be honest my favorite sweetener is mantra but ever since this pandemic and Kovach thing I haven't been able to get some from Mexico which is where usually my wife brings it from so if you do have the choice my favorite is one fruit but any any sweetener works just fine so these were in the oven for 12 minutes and when when those 12 minutes go by you're gonna see them on they're gonna look super soft and raw and you're gonna be like man wait ah this is not cooked I have to leave them in for longer trust me just take them out of the oven they're gonna look super soft but after 10 minutes they're gonna crisp up and have really really good consistency which is this what they look like right now I already tried one and let me tell you they are amazing we made six cookies and these are gonna be the macros for the cookies can you do this recipe with some other nut butter sure just make sure it's natural it doesn't have any added sugar good thing with some other nut butters such as almond butter it can be more liquid so they might turn out a little different but they are gonna work so this is the consistency of the baked cookie so a little crispy now does it feel chewy at all but I already know that they're great so let's give it a taste test oh my life imagine daddy daddy it's amazing that that this doesn't have any kind of almond flour or coconut flour the texture is amazing peanut butter can be a little controversial and keto diet why because technically it's a legume and it is a little more inflammatory than other nuts however macro wise macros wise it does have very friendly keto friendly macros very similar to most nuts though they're good for this lifestyle and especially here in Colombia and Latin America and general peanuts are a lot more affordable than like walnuts pecans almonds those can be crazy expensive here so it's a good alternative however I wouldn't eat peanut butter on a daily basis just because it is a little inflammatory and I don't know about you but I love peanut butter it's addicting to me so I try not to use it that often because once I take I don't know how to spoon a spoonful of peanut butter that will be the end of me if that does happen to you just make sure you buy it in like pouches or if it is for a recipe I don't use whatever you need and then hide it because I know that having a jar of opened peanut butter around the house can be very dangerous for a lot of us if it's your first time watching my channel welcome this is this is a child for you I do have my main youtube channel is in Spanish and this is a brand new channel I

"hey guys it's Tenley and it's time for some sweet bakery gluten free baking today I'm making the easiest peanut butter cookies you've ever made and only a few ingredients so this is so so easy all we're gonna do is start putting our ingredients in the mixing bowl and I have my nice big mixer here so one egg is the first movie we can use 3/4 cup of short sugar just regular sugar then you're gonna put in 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon baking soda and then 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla now when you're doing Lewton free baking and you actually need to be very careful with your vanilla vanilla can have other kinds of ingredients in it that contains gluten and you wouldn't know it so if some of the things to look for is just the least ingredients on the van up it says vanilla extract from the vanilla bean or make sure you don't buy one with caramel color I like to stay away from that because it can be dangerous all right so we're gonna lock this up and I'm just gonna start the table he was good at mixed in there now we're gonna go ahead and add in our peanut butter mix now we're just using 1 cup creamy peanut butter and the best way to buy a peanut butter is with the least ingredients as well so whatever one says just peanuts or peanut consult that's probably the best one to get alright so you get that our peanut butter in there and then we're gonna mix it all together this is beautiful tweaks such a great little mix here I can't believe it was just those ingredients look at that alright so now that we've got our peanut butter mix we can make these buddies into cookies good so you just want a melon baller a cookie scoop to get nice round cookie dough rounds and we can also just use a big spoon get a spoonful on there start to scoop and put it on your okay so now I've scooped all of my cookie dough rounds onto my cookie sheet I'm going to just press it lightly with the back of a fork I have that nice you know stripes mix of peanut butter cookie peanut butter cookie and put these in the oven now so I'm putting the cookies in the oven for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees I'm probably gonna check them around seven minutes just to make sure that they're not browning too fast because I just want to pull an imperfect and slightly soft and chewy our easy gluten free peanut butter cookie recipe worked out just great I take them out of the oven around eight minutes they look like they work just perfectly done and let them cool for a while and now I have them on a plate to share it's gonna be perfect for my friends that are coming from out of town

can make a living and i'd love for you guys to help support and grow this channel let's get stuck into these delicious cookies today on this grand line i'm going to show you guys how to make these chocolate peanut butter levine cookies i hope i'm saying that right these are inspired by the famous new york bakery which make these really chunky big cookies they're really fudgy and melt in your mouth in the center these things are so ridiculously easy to make it's a one ball method recipe and i'm gonna show you just how to make them right now what i really love about these cookies is like they're like a hefty cookie but they're not too heavy like they're not gonna make you feel gross when you eat them they're really light and that's because of a couple of the ingredients that we're going to be using so let's begin with the dry ingredients we're going to be adding some cocoa powder into a mixing bowl now over here i have some cake flour and the cake flake is one of the ingredients that's going to make these a much lighter cookie and not necessarily chewy so we're going to pop that in there let's just tip these ingredients together next we're going to add some all-purpose flour some cornstarch again this is going to result in a much lighter cookie because of the cornstarch some baking soda to help these cookies rise and a little bit of salt just for some flavor we're going to sift these ingredients in here if you have any lumps you can just squash them through give these a gentle mix with a whisk we're going to set this aside and move on to the wet ingredients so into a large mixing bowl i'm going to be adding my butter and some sugar now i'm just going to use my hand mixer to mix these ingredients for about three or four minutes until it's nice and light fluffy and pale this is gonna aerate our mixture a little bit it's gonna help these cookies be nice and light so you definitely don't want to skip this step that's looking nice and fluffy now so we're gonna scrape down the bowl and add our egg so one egg and we're gonna mix that until it's really well combined then we're gonna scrape down again and add the second egg and repeat that you want to dump half of your dry ingredients into your mixing bowl and mix that using a spatula i find that doing it this way rather than adding all the dry ingredients at once is much much easier so once that's looking nice and smooth we want to add the rest of the dry ingredients once that has formed a dough we're gonna dump in three cups of peanut butter choc chips now these peanut butter choc chips are going to add flavor but they're also going to make the center of this cookie really gooey and delicious so once you've mixed all of that in we're ready to scoop now to scoop these cookies i'm going to be using a large ice cream scoop now this holds three tablespoons of mixture in it but to make each cookie we're going to need two scoops so six tablespoons of mixture so you want to scoop your mixture out so one scoop and two scoops and that is going to form our cookies now you don't want to roll these into a perfect ball you don't need to worry about that but what you do want to do is gently pat down or squash down your cookies these are going to go in the oven for seven minutes they're going to be really soft and gooey as soon as they come out so you don't want to try eating them or moving them you'll burn yourself and they'll fall to pieces you want to let them cool down for about 10 or 15 minutes before you eat them you can serve them warm or at room temperature these cookies have finished baking and my house smells so chocolatey right now it's so good so while i'm trying these could you guys please hit the like button because it helps this channel grow so hit the

recipes from me i'll see you all on the next episode of described mine bye", "91jqiYvYB50": "so today we're going to be making peanut butter no bake cookies you're gonna need a stick of butter 2 cups of sugar 1/2 a cup of milk 3/4 cup of peanut butter 3 cups of oatmeal wax paper a big spoon a pan and 1/4 cups and a half cup instead of using a 1/2 cup you could use a 1 cup but I find that it's easier to just dip the 1/2 cup and try to shove the 1 cup in there or to pour the oats into the 1 cup so the first thing we're going to do is we're gonna take our stick of butter and just put it in the pain the next thing we're gonna do is pour 1/2 cup of milk Hopkins milk and pour it directly into the pan with the butter then we're going to take our two cups of sugar and you're also going to not we're gonna go ahead and combine the other half of the recipe into this bowl that way after this is finished boiling for a minute and a half we can get just dump this straight in there so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna get three cups of oatmeal and this doesn't really have to be too exact then three camps and then you need three force' cups of peanut butter and try to kind of squish it down in there it's make sure that you don't have any air pockets so there's 1/4 and when you take it out try to dump it in the middle that way it doesn't stick to the sides and you don't have to fight with it when you're just trying to get it quickly into the pan okay so the thing about this is is that once they're finished it hardens super quickly so I'm going to go ahead and take out wax paper we're also going to go ahead and set up our timer which actually does not have seconds so we're gonna do a stopwatch and we're just gonna have to watch for when it hits a minute so we're gonna place the pan on the burner and turn on high and just stir it and you can kind of break up your butter if you want and this is actually real Land O'Lakes butter so it's really really really hard margarine melts more easily and you just have to stir it continuously because it will burn and stick to the sides so here it's almost melted they're just little clumps of butter left I'm sure that I'll be gone in a few seconds and just a side note after you spoon these out you will immediately want to put water and a little bit of dish soap in it or else it will stick to the pan and it will be a monster to clean all right so the butter is melted and that's what it looks like all right so it's boiling so I'm gonna start my timer and stir you will not want to keep it on high this whole time because if it felt boils over and hits your skin it will stick and burn and it will hurt like right now it's popping on my hand and it hurt so I'm trying to keep it out so I turn mine from high to about eight spin a minute in ten seconds and it looks pretty much the same all right so it's in a minute thirty seconds the heat and I'm gonna add this I'm worried that it's not gonna be big enough that's hot just stir it in carefully I probably should have gotten a bigger pan okay so you can see that it's really thick and once it gets to this consistency you want to immediately start dropping it on the wax paper they will spread out a little bit me give me a baby spoon I think there's going to sink make some small ones make some big ones just do it quickly okay now as I said earlier scrape it off scrape it all off and then immediately run Oh and the pan so the recipe made about 24 cookies and they've been sitting for about 10 minutes they're still a little warm and they're cool enough to eat toxic chocolate lime juice but these are really good next time to make chocolate", "2K7SCDpDd0o": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to my channel legaro mix so today we will prepare peanut butter

i've already unboxed everything i match pick up from the company so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna sample all of it and i'm gonna give you guys my personal opinion on it and if it's worth investing your money in okay guys so it's sample time but before i do that let me show you guys the different flavors i got peanut butter cookie flavor this one sounds pretty damn good i'm not gonna lie sneaker doodle i'm not that big big of a fan of sneakers i don't know if i like that one i chose to actually buy was the cake pop flavor so i'm going to quickly do i'm going to line them up on the table then i'm going to sample them one by one before we dive straight in and sample the protein powder let me give you guys some more information about it so this protein powder has got a combination of whey protein and it's got casein inside of it as well so the difference between whey and casein essentially the digestion of these protein powders the whey is quite fast absorbing and fast digesting and casein is a little bit slow digesting which is good for keeping you full really so that's pretty awesome this has got a combination of both inside of it and of course it's got bcaas in it so per servings about five grams of bcaas and a little bit of a macro breakdown for you guys so it's got 27 servings overall inside the whole tub 24 grams of protein and one gram of fat time for the taste test so i'm going to start off with the sneaker dual one first then i'm gonna go on to the peanut butter cookie then we're going to finish off with the cake pop one i'm going to give them a rating out of 10 10 being the best tasting one being the worst tasting okay we're going to go for the sneaky dude first like i said let's give a bit of a smell see what it smells like hmm good this one smells actually surprisingly nice i didn't expect it to smell like this okay let's taste it see what it tastes like okay this is actually pretty damn good i expect it to be this good but it's very good let's give this one a rating so this one is it's pretty damn good guys i'm not gonna lie it's not too sweet but it's sweet enough and the texture of it's quite it's quite creamy to be fair and it smells pretty damn good it's not the best protein i ever tasted so gonna have to give it a 8.5 because it's still pretty damn good next up we got a peanut butter cookie one so same again let's do a bit of a smell see what smells like hmm so this one you can really smell the peanut butter so it's quite overpowering so there's many many cookie in this i can't smell no cookie okay let's taste it and see what it tastes like i can't smell a lot of peanut butter so i'm expecting the taste majority of peanut butter than any sort of cookie see do you know what i was kind of waiting for more from to when i had it but it's not really that it's kind of like it's lacking it's like i don't know it's lacking something there definitely isn't much cookie disguise at all let me cook in it i can't taste any cookie if you're gonna get this expect nothing but peanut butter a six out of ten because there's nothing really special about this one next up we got the cake pop this is the one i actually bought so fingers crossed is actually pretty damn good let's go let's give it a smell first okay so i can't taste a little bit of cake in it so hmm you know i'm sweet guys i'm not gonna lie and by far it's probably the best one of all of them it is pretty sweet so i can only imagine if i actually use milk to mix it with can i get water in here it would taste even sweeter to be fair but in terms of the taste probably is by far the best one i'd easily give this one a nine a nine out of ten especially if you go like a sweet tooth like myself this is pretty damn good as a taste test over let's give them a ranking from one two and three number one has to be the cake pop one of course because that's the best one number two we got a sneaker doodle then the worst that all of them is gonna have to be the peanut butter cookie one because it's just overpowering peanut butter there's nothing else perfect peanut butter you can just taste and that is all for today guys hope you enjoyed the video make sure you smash that thumbs up button and subscribe for more if you haven't already i'll catch you guys very soon", "dCn0c6fsAKQ": "horns up and welcome to a brand new episode of head bangers kitchen today's recipe has been a long time coming what are we making we're gonna be making some delicious keto peanut butter cookies whoo yeah now you guys have been asking me for a keto cookie recipe for a long time and I thought to myself you know what let's make some peanut butter cookies and I gotta be honest guys pretty much every single keto youtuber has a peanut butter cookie recipe as does every other youtube baker this cookie is so popular and so easy to make and I thought this is the best place to start from but we're going to give this recipe the headbangers kitchen twist anyway enough jibber-jabber let's get cooking so the first thing we're going to do is preheat our oven to about 170 degrees Celsius the next thing we're going to do is make the batter for the cookies and I'm gonna start with about 250 grams of all-natural peanut butter the good stuff made with just peanuts and nothing else into that goes about 70 grams of Sukhram gold which I have powdered in my food processor next up half a teaspoon of cinnamon powder 1 tablespoon of psyllium husk a splash of vanilla extract a pinch of salt and I'm also going to grate in some fresh ginger but if you don't have fresh ginger you can also use ginger powder and finally I'm going to crack in one whole egg and then I'm going to mix everything well with my spatula and you're basically making a cookie dough now the psyllium husk the ginger and the cinnamon is all optional but that is to make these cookies even more flavorful than the regular ones anyway mix it all well and you need to use a little bit of elbow grease because you want everything to be well incorporated and you should end up with a nice thick cookie dough I would also recommend tasting the cookie dough to know whether it has enough sweetness because some people like their cookies to be extremely sweet and some not so much anyway once the batter has all come together you're pretty much ready to go now people always ask me about serving sizes and how do I measure things out and I like to use a kitchen scale so I'm going to weigh out the cookie batter which is about 390 grams and since I want to make eight cookies that's roughly 48 grams per cookie so I'm going to portion out the cookie dough into eight balls and just take it with your hands and then roll it round and round and your cookie dough balls are ready now it's time to bake these so make sure that your baking tray is lined with some parchment paper or a Silpat or some kind of silicone mat and then place your cookie dough balls onto that now make sure there is enough space between each of them because these are going to spread and once you're done placing them on the baking tray it's time for the final touches what we're going to do is we're going to take a fork and we're going to press down on the cookie batter to give it that well what they call the traditional peanut butter cookie look so a crisscross pattern on each cookie press the fork down one way then cross it and press it down the other way pretty simple do that to all your cookies and then these go into our preheated oven for about 12 to 15 minutes and you want to cook them till the edges start to brown after about 15 minutes cookies are ready and I am just going to leave them now and let them cool completely don't touch them till they are completely cool anyway after about 15 minutes the cookies are cool and they are pretty much ready oh yeah look at that anyway those are your peanut butter cookies I mean your keto peanut butter cookies and it's time to taste them alright folks so it's time to taste our peanut butter cookie and I gotta be honest it's more of soft cookie than a crispy cookie so if you were looking for something crispy like a biscuit this is probably not the recipe for you they smell pretty good and I will be honest I'm not the biggest fan in general of cookies and biscuits but I'm going to give this a try any which way anyway let's taste okay it's chewy it's definitely got a peanut flavor you get that hint of cinnamon and ginger the sweetness is to my liking but you know what it's a cookie like I've never excited about cookies so for me I mean is this something I'm going to be making all the time probably not but hey if you love cookies this is good to make a batch off and keep in your house and you can munch on them whenever you feel like so do make these let me know how they turned out let me know what your thoughts are on these cookies anyway I will see you on the next episode of headbangers kitchen Cheers and keep keto no way keep cooking Key towing is for the other series anyway later hey guys I would also recommend that you make your cookies smaller I actually made mine quite large in size so I would definitely recommend making smaller cookies and more cookies anyway if you like the recipe give the video the thumbs up subscribe to headbangers kitchen and watch another video Cheers", "tFGG5451zWM": "hi guys i am viva in today's video i'm going to show you the recipe for the old-fashioned american classic peanut butter cookies they're loved from many of us all we need is some butter of course peanut butter 1 egg white and brown sugar and here I have my dry ingredients flour with little baking powder and baking soda so let's start and let's have some fun in a mixing bowl add the butter unsalted butter white sugar brown sugar of course the peanut butter and 1 egg and now we get our hand mixer and mix that very well I'm switching to my spatula these are my dry ingredients the flour with some baking soda and baking powder powder and I'm gonna give them a good mix before I add them I gave it a quick mix and just to clarify why I switched to my spatula when I added all the dry ingredients if I go straight with the mixer the flour will fly all over the place so I just mix them real fast with my spatula and now I'll go to continue with my hand mixer until the mix is ready if you use the hand mixer from time to time clean the beaters scrape the walls everything well and beat and till you get everything very well in copper incorporated if you use standing mixer do the same we're almost done one last mix [Applause] the cookie dough is ready now I'm gonna place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes and I'll be right back as soon as it's ready I took it out of the refrigerator I left it for about 45 minutes I believe that's enough and now we have to start placing them on the parchment paper I just turned my oven to 375 degrees and it's preheating in the moment so let's start and I'm using my smaller ice cream scoop just to form them and make it easy to be the same size there is this like that [Music] and we have to space them apart because when they bake they will increase their size [Music] and let me show you what I do now I'm gonna grab it roll it and roll in some sugar there it is and again roll then roll in the sugar and this is how we go after I roll the dough in balls and I roll them in sugar because that gives them extra delicious flavor and the next is to make the signature stamp for the peanut butter cookie use your largest fork you have I have made myself this from skewers I hope that's the right word skewers I cut four of them about this size place on a duct tape and flip the duct tape and this is what I have so I'm going to show you with both how it works I like this better so let's do it with the fork I'm gonna take them in the oven and bake them for about 10 minutes everyone's oven is different so just watch them about 10 11 minutes should be enough look at this the smell is insane these are the best peanut butter cookies out there if you love peanut butter if you're not allergic to it make this try them at home you're gonna love them let me show you oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh that's so good thanks for watching I'll see you next time and bye you", "za3yWNv1XPs": "- Hey guys, today I'm\ngonna share with you my recipe for a classic peanut butter cookie. It's one of those cookies that you need to have in the repertoire. They're easy to put together and so simple because they don't require a\nton of different ingredients. In fact, I bet you have\nmost of these things already on hand. Let me show you how to put together a super simple peanut butter cookie. So you're first gonna begin by adding three quarters cup of butter\ninto an electric mixer. To that you're gonna add one\ncup of light brown sugar. And one quarter cup of\nregular white sugar. Now I've done a lot of\ntesting with this recipe and this to me is the perfect ratio. Because you want the brown sugar because that has molasses in it and it's gonna give the cookie a really nice depth of\nflavor and chewiness. But you do need a quarter\ncup of the white sugar, which is going to give it it's crispness. So you're just gonna beat that up until all the sugar and\nthe butter is combined. Scrape down the bowl as needed. (lighthearted, low music) And then you're gonna\nadd the peanut butter. And when it comes to peanut butter, I can not stress enough, you really wanna make sure\nyou check the ingredient list. You would be surprised what they put in peanut butter these days. And the only thing it\nshould say is peanuts. So you wanna make sure\nthere's no added salt, no added sugar or no added things you don't know how to pronounce. Especially when you're baking you really want a pure product so, classic peanut\nbutter is the way to go. Then you're gonna add\ntwo eggs, one at a time. Beating in between each addition and scraping down the bowl. And two teaspoons of vanilla extract. Go ahead and give that a beat until everything is nice and combined. And then in a separate bowl we're gonna add our dry ingredients. We're gonna add one and a half\ncups of all purpose flour. One teaspoon of baking soda. And one teaspoon of salt. Just whisk that up until\neverything's combined. Then you're gonna add your dry ingredients to your wet ingredients, just in thirds. Beating up until everything\nis nice and incorporated. Now at this stage you have two ways to go, you can either bake right away or I like to take the dough\nand pop it in the freezer for just about 10 to 15 minutes. Just to harden up a bit, it'll make it easier to\ncreate the cross hatch pattern that is so traditional for\na peanut butter cookie. Otherwise the dough has\na tendency to kinda stick and you have to use a lot of flour. So, it's up to you. Then to bake we're gonna\nline a cookie sheet with some parchment paper and we're gonna scoop\nout about six dough balls onto this cookie sheet. I'm using a two inch scoop because these do spread out a little bit, so I find that those are usually\nthe better scoops to use. Then you're gonna take some flour and just spread it on your cutting board, make a little mound and then taking a fork you're gonna dip the fork in the flour and then you're gonna\nmake a cross hatch pattern on each dough ball. So you just press the fork in one way and then turn the fork\naround and go the other way. You don't wanna press\nthe fork too deeply down otherwise it will lose\nthat patter as it bakes. So just be gentle. You just need to really do\na very subtle impression. Then you're gonna place\nin a 350 degree oven for just about 13 minutes. You wanna make sure that those\ncookies are golden, brown and that they're nice and set. And then let your cookies cool from anywhere to two to three minutes. And then you can pile\nthem high in a platter and let everybody dig\nin and be so impressed that you made homemade\npeanut butter cookies. They're really delicious. They are the perfect combination of chewiness and crispness, mixed with that peanut butter flavor. And there is nothing more comforting than a homemade peanut butter cookie that's still warm from the oven. (gentle laugh) I hope you guys give this one a try and let me know what you think. And I will see you back here next week for another easy and delicious recipe. Until then, bye.

meet you at the mixer put together this fantastic butter cookie truly think you're going to enjoy it and I know that this is gonna go into your repertoire and you'll be making it again and again be right back okay now we're at the mixer and we're getting ready to start to prepare the butter cookies this is real simple like I told you first she's going to put in the two sticks of softened butter once she gets that in then she's going to go ahead and start the mixer [Music] now these are [Music] and you should be able to make this you wanna meet your coven [Music] you cook this cookie for about [Music] a very light brown color what you have understand and your plate and 2/3 cup it's a blink meal now yes Linda the end you're going to and your next ingredient to want to be two teaspoons of vanilla extract and that and allow us to win and game you're going to start to add slowly add your flower I mean we're going to add it just a little bit more than intention at the time but you can do it any way you want to miss don't dump it all in in one time we'll add a sort and mix mix well now this is 2 cups of flour + 2 tbsp so you're gonna have to clubs and you're gonna add two more tablespoons well this is all-purpose flour once it forms a ball that's about it you're going to take it out ball guard make a little ball which will show you how to do that and then we're going to flatten them out using three fingers and we'll show this how to do that we're going to put it on an ungreased baking sheet and again you've got to bake it in the oven 350 degrees for 12 to 14 minutes this is the very simple cookie but it's a very good cook so we're going to continue to add the flour until that just balls up take some up about five minutes to mix our new ingredients together stuff it's not a long process at all now as you can see is what is bowling club we have this cookie all the time you disturb these cookies and ice creams and leaning back but easily you know think that if we try it you are truly going to enjoy it and I think that you'll make it time and time again because it's an easy and quick dessert and really if you look at it it's kind of cool now that we have it's completed so we're gonna meet you at the stove where we'll show you how to bottle it together and then we'll show you how to press it down put it in the oven and bag right back at the stove just moved right over and now she's gonna show you how to ball it together and as you can see it was a big lump of dough so you ball it together and then you take your three fingers and you press it down now you can make these cookies as big or as small as you want to you can make some big and you can make some small it doesn't matter but you want to ball it just roll it around in your hand and fall it and then you want to press it down with your three fingers just to make like a wave in the cookie now when you bake these cooking's off it won't be much darker than that when it comes out of the oven you don't want to bake them until they are truly dark because that's considered burnt now your bottom will be a little bit darker but that's all the dark that you need just the slightly bit darker than what you see on the pan is all you need for the cookie to be done now we're going to bake off all of these cookies and you see how to do it we have another pan that we want to use so we'll move that one over and then we'll go in for the second paint now we'll continue and then once we get them all done we'll put them in the oven bake them off for 12 to 14 minutes and then we'll bring you back okay I'll get both of these pans the cookie sheets we got them ready with cookies on it now just want to show you we did some bigger and some smaller and you're not gonna get a lot of spread out of the cookies so that can they can be that close together you're just gonna a little spread so you don't have to worry about that so we're gonna go ahead and put it in the oven and when they bake us off bring you right back Oh cookies see they're not much darker than the than the original ones world okay I mean that not much darker than they were when we first made them okay so you're going to allow the cookies to cool sitting on the baking sheet for about seven to eight minutes so once they're cooled then we'll bring it back and we'll show you exactly what they look like but look right around the edges if you look around the edges of the cookie so you can see it's a little bit darker the bottom is going to be darker okay but these will be like they should be once they cool so we'll bring you back and say look at how they came out they came out really really good and see they're not much darker than they were at the time that you put them in and that's something that you need to be aware of because then I don't want you to judge when you would take them out by how dark they are you judge it according to either twelve or fourteen minutes but one of the good signs is see the bottom the bottom is the color that it should be see the bottom are the color you know the color that it would normally be with a regular cookie but this is the way that you really want to eat it because this is the best way it's really delicious when they come out like this and they're not too dark just want to show you a different way to do things and that's the butter cookie and I think that that's gonna be the best cookie that you're ever going to eat as always thank you for watching Chris cook for you too bye [Music]", "BRtEGqzHCoc": "hi everyone today I'm going to show you how to make Reese's Pieces cookies in my stand mixer I have two sticks of butter that's one cup of butter you could use a half a cup of butter and a half a cup of shortening if you would like to but I just like using butter because it makes them taste really good and I'm going to just cream the butter really quick now to the butter I'm going to add one cup of packed brown sugar you can add light or dark it doesn't matter a half a cup of granulated sugar half a teaspoon of baking soda and I'm also going to add in just a little bit of salt and I'm gonna beat this together until it's light and fluffy after your butter and sugars have creamed together you're going to add two eggs and it's about a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract you can eyeball it and I'm going to beat that until the eggs are mixed in really well now I'm going to beat in two and a half cups of all-purpose flour and I'm going to do just a little at a time like maybe about a half a cup at a time after you have your flour beat in you're going to add a cup of Reese's Pieces and I'm gonna add in about a half a cup of white chocolate chips you could use chocolate chips if you want or you can just add some more Reese's Pieces to that and now I'm going to just beat these in on it like a low speed and after you have those beat in your cookie dough is done I'm going to scoop these out onto a parchment lined baking sheet you can scoop them as big or as small as you want and I'm gonna bake them at 350 degrees for anywhere between eight to ten minutes it just depends on how you like your cookies if you like them crispy obviously you want to bake them a little bit longer and if you like them chewy and like soft and kind of doughy then you'll bake them for less I hope that you guys enjoyed this video if you did

new items from quest we have I have a quest protein bar this is the chocolate hazelnut and has a quest cookie it is the peanut butter chocolate chip so the quest chocolate hazelnut bar is a hundred and ninety calories and I'm gonna go ahead and open this and like Kevin get it going we don't eat the cookie up to Jersey I don't think we heat the choking I don't know or do you want to eat the cookie let's take the cookie element I don't remember he needs the cookie for good we usually the quest bars we we eat half and try he didn't any did you see which one we like it best the cookie gosh it's not like you know better I don't remember whether when we try to cook you whether we heated it or not so we're just which can do it nice thing okay so Kevin's gonna eat those and you keep on okay I want to thank Valerie because the Valerie contacted me on through Facebook I have a Tammy done YouTube that's what you search for on Facebook Tammy done YouTube and you will find my map you to pay I mean my facebook page and so she contacted me on my Facebook page Valerie did and she said would you go to the Vitamin Shoppe and get this she said I think they're only sold at the Vitamin Shoppe right now so we took the track to the Vitamin Shoppe because it's like 45 minutes away from where we live and it's the most inconvenient convoluted place to get in and out of but anyway they were 259 inch to Vitamin Shoppe so the chocolate hazelnut has 20 grams of protein four grams of carbs one grandma sugar 14 grams of fiber so we will try it heated and he didn't yell let's do the bar first are you kind of stuck it makes it chewy ger it has pieces of height actual pieces of hazelnut that that's the decent string so I like it like that it's very good stuff I really like I like the texture of it when you put it in the microwave because it does make it soft oh yeah we found like chocolate hazelnut I like the flavor of the chocolate it's it's sweet very sweet that is a hazelnut you're getting humped of hazelnut I really like that protein while it's good mm-hmm I don't really care for the chocolate I've already done it's not my favorite I like the one serve but the fruitier ones the sweeter ones well I bet I think it's plenty sweeten it for me this is a chocolate flavor today I love America let's try the cookie I would get that one Valerie I know she was wondering about it I would get that one again and again this is the blue one this is the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie and it is 220 calories for one cooking Huber's I do not like that about we need try it on you ah pick a service but I don't think I've ever had any peanut butter ones there but they've had that real life I feel like when I'm eating that peanut butter woman there I'm chewing up on an old sock no nice talk that's been on somebody's foot and it has their funk act you know what's bad - I don't like it they call cookies thick on reason boy cookie there is nothing could you like it that the textures wrong well it is project nobody grams of protein 5 grams of net carbs 1 gram of sugar and 11 grams of fine but I mean a cookie is flowery and buttery and sweet these are not cookies these are just different with shaking like E and the con granny yeah I didn't enjoy bonding uh yeah that's not good it's the in it's the peanut butter the peanut room it has a funkiness to it and I eat all eyes power peanut butter right powdered peanut butter almost every single day of my life and I like paddle peanut butter if you get the right brand you will like it - I do not like that if I had to choose I'd pick the chocolate hazelnut all what I don't care for it I like some of the other class for us better but but did you did you like it heated or any events I like both of them heated better if I were to choose either one of those I would pick them he I would heat him up for I want to heat him up for ten seconds mm-hmm well I truly like the hazelnut chocolate I like it both ways he did animated he did it it's only the bad the only bad thing about heating is you eat it so quickly you do so it's best if you want the meal to last then I would not heat it up because I like to unheated - I would not heat it and then it's gonna take you longer to chew it because it's denser and if the flavor didn't really change ya know the flavor didn't change at all it's it's all a matter of how quickly you want to eat it because it is going to take your order I would never get that cook again I do not like that flavor at all I'm sure this we've got this model boy yeah just not me so but now but for me that the bars a success I know you didn't care for but for me it's a success I like that a lot so thank you Valerie for letting us know about these I'll have a picture for you at the end

these biscuits and then I recommend you try them so thanks for watching", "fge4wrtJbJ4": "(upbeat music) - Hey Munchies! Welcome if you're new. I'm Alyssia and I am so\nhappy to have you here. A few months ago, I did a\nlow-carb desserts episode and you guys wanted more so now I have cookies. - (groans) Oh these cookies! - Put that cookie down! Now! - I have six cookie recipes\nthat are low in carbs and low in sugar and if you\nstick around til the end I'm gonna show you how\nyou can get a free PDF with all the recipes. First up is a classic,\nrevised chocolate chip. I combine almond flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in one bowl. In another, I whisk\ntogether melted butter, now I chose grass-fed butter today because that's what a\nclassic cookie calls for, but if you aren't a fan,\ncoconut oil is fine. Eggs, Erythritol, or a\nlow-carb granulated sweetener of your choice, and vanilla extract. I stir the dry into the wet and then I can mix in\nsugar-free chocolate chips, or you could use cacao nibs if you really wanted\nto boost the nutrition. Transfer scoops of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment. Slightly flatten with your hand and bake until the edges begin to brown and allow to cool before enjoying. Holy moly! Buttery, soft, and a\ntad cakey in the middle with a crisp edge and a nice\nbalance of salty and sweet. That almond flour provides a\nnice nutty taste that I love and I think you will too. (suspenseful music) How about another classic? Peanut butter. This one is so easy because\nit has just a few ingredients and some of you may have\nseen recipes like this before but what you may not have realized is it's actually so easy\nto make it low-carb. Combine peanut butter,\na low-carb sweetener, and I recommend using a powdered sweeter, if you don't have one,\nyou can just blend up regular granulated sweetener in a blender. Along with an egg and salt if your peanut butter isn't salted. Mix it up. I prefer my hand mixer for this dough. And then scoop out the dough and transfer to your baking sheet. For the classic look, I use a fork to create the crisscross pattern and press those babies down. Bake them up but don't\nlet them brown too much. They will burn quickly. Then you can transfer to\nyour baking rack and cool. If you are a peanut butter cookie fan, these will not disappoint. They've got a crisp\nedge and a softer middle with a very potent peanut butter flavor since there's not much else\nto them ingredients wise. If you are noticing that these\ncookies seem higher in fat, you are correct! That is because typically\ntake one macronutrient out, like carbs, you gotta add\nanother back in, like fat. And that's the way the cookie crumbles. If you wanna learn more\nabout a low-carb lifestyle, check out my Keto 101 video. We're taking that recipe to the next level and making a low-carb double\nchocolate chunk cookie. I combine almond or any\nnut butter you prefer, two eggs, cocoa powder,\npowdered sweetener, baking powder and salt if\nneeded with a hand mixer. Stir in some dark chocolate chunks, sugar-free if preferred. Dollop that dough. Press down a bit and bake in the oven. Again, cool on a baking\nrack before enjoying.

I repeat, you will not be notified (static) - [Alyssia] Almond is a milder nut butter, so it pairs well with the\ncocoa without overpowering it. This is definitely a\ndouble chocolate cookie, Dense and fudge-y. Were going to the opposite side of the chocolate spectrum this time with one of my personal favorite classics: a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. What is your favorite cookie? Let me know in the comments below. First, I've gotta make\nmy white chocolate chips. This is a tough one for low carb because there aren't really\nany white chocolate chips that are sugar free or low carb on the market that I know about. If you do know about them, let me know. Either way, I'm showing you\nhow to make your own now. Melt down cacao butter and coconut oil, add that to a blender with\ndry whole milk powder, powdered sweetener and a pinch of salt. Use a baster or syringe to transfer to your chocolate chip\nmolds or a bar mold is fine. And then refrigerate until hardened. Pop those babies out and\nthen store in the freezer until you're ready to use. For the cookie, I combine almond flour, baking soda, baking powder\nand salt in one bowl. And butter, eggs, sweetener,\nand vanilla in another. I add the dry to the wet. And then can stir in my\nchopped macadamia nuts. Once I have the dough, I\ndollop on to the baking sheet. And press. But wait, what about the white chocolate? Because these melt quickly, you'll want to add them\nto your cookies frozen. I just throw them on top last minute before they go in the oven. Bake those babies up and\nobserve and acknowledge how great you are for making\nsuch a delicious cookie. (whooshing) Macadamia and white chocolate\nmeans salty and sweet together, a perfect cookie\npairing in my opinion. Soft in the middle, a crispy edge, and the almond flour makes it extra nutty. We've done a lot of cooking so far. What about a no bake cookie? Do you want a no bake cookie recipe? If you do, thumbs up. Okay, so you know I'm\ngonna give it to ya anyway, but the least you can do is\ngive me a dang thumbs up. (static) I add unsweetened coconut\nshreds, coconut oil, liquid sweetener of choice,\nI'm using a liquid fiber syrup that I will link in the description, but you can use any liquid sweetener, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix it super well. And then use damp hands to\nform into your cookie shapes. Let those babies firm up in the fridge. Say what? These are a bit addicting,\nso it may be best to keep them frozen and thaw\nout when you're ready to eat. Okay, I've got one more today. Last but not least: shortbread\ncookies low carb edition. These are so easy. Combine butter and\nsweetener with a hand mixer. Add in vanilla and salt,\nthen you can beat in your almond flour,\nabout a third at a time. If the dough ends up too crumbly or dry, consider adding one more\ntable spoon of melted butter. Scoop out compressed spoonfuls of dough, form them into your cookie\nshape, and add to a cookie sheet. Flatten slightly on top. These won't spread much, so\nflatten them before they go in. Bake in the oven until the\nedges are golden brown. Cool completely on the\ntray before serving. Holy Toledo! These actually taste just\nlike a shortbread cookie. Not too dry or dense, buttery, not a biscuit, but truly a cookie. I hope you enjoyed these.

(beep) - [Alyssia] Oh, oh hi.", "Bzp1-9LcR98": "hi I'm Cheryl and from cherry Lyons cupcakes and today I'm going to show you how to make these peanut butter and Nutella stuffed choc chip cookies if you haven't watched my previous video on how you prepared the dough for these cookies please click the link on the top right hand corner and come back to you when you're done so now that your dough is slightly softened you're able to pull apart handfuls of dough quite easily so just squish them up into balls make sure they are really compact and roll them smoothly each cookie ball should be around the size of a golf ball and once you're done with all of that just wrap it back up in your plastic wrap and stick it back in the fridge for it to firm up once again next you'll need to prepare some mini cupcake papers for you to drop in gobs of Nutella and peanut butter in them in separate papers of course so as you can see here and Nutella has kind of a really thick consistency so you don't really have to worry much about it being messy and dripping all over the place just grab a generous amount and drop it right into your paper and just a random question I was talking to my sister the other day and discussing whether we've grown up saying Nutella wrongly because I've heard some people call it Nutella but I've always called it Nutella so we've a comment below to let me know if I've been saying it wrong all my life but either way it doesn't really matter tastes delicious just eat it and depending on how many peanut butter and Nutella stuffed choc chip cookies you plan on making if you follow the original recipe for the dough I would recommend making around 20 to 25 Nutella cups and 2025 peanutbutter cups and here I'm just showing you how I put my peanut butter into these little cupcake liners as you can see peanut butter it's much thicker and consistency and that's not really drip into the cups so you will need to use two teaspoons to make these and here I'm just using smooth peanut butter but you can use crunchy if that's what you prefer so now once you're done with all of that you just wrap it up again with plastic wrap and stick it in the fridge for around half an hour next on a buttered or greased shellow cupcake tray take one ball of your cookie dough and squish it down to try to make a nice flat circle as you can see here my cookie dough is kind of hard cuz it was fresh out of the fridge but slowly you will realize that it gets easier to work with so once you get it to a nice flat circle that's around the size of your pan holes you just stick it in and use your fingers to gently press it down towards the sides and all the way up until the corners be patient with this step and it will be so much easier for you to do this if you have short nails because that way your nails wouldn't stab and pierce into the cookie dough you want to make sure that there are no cracks in the base or on the sides at all when you're doing this step because you don't want the Nutella and a peanut butter to lose out prematurely when you don't want it to now if your peanut butter and Nutella cups haven't shown completely just cover this up in some plastic wrap and stick it in the fridge while that shows you will know when the Nutella is chilled for long enough when you're able to remove the cupcake paper and a Nutella still holds its shape now only move on to the next step after your dough lined cupcake pans have been sitting on your counter for a little while for it to softened you'll understand why I say this is important later on so once that's done put in your chilled peanut butter and your chilled Mattel on top of that press it down and then grab a ball of the cookie dough that you've already separated out split it into half roll it into a ball again flatten it out and put it on top pressing it firmly onto the sides of your dough that's already in the pan now once that's done you take a chopstick with a rounded tip and just gently press it down to make lines around the sides this will help the corners of your dough to stick together to create the casing for your Nutella and peanut butter cups and once you're done with that just gently use your fingers to press down the sides to make it smooth and rid of those lines that your chopstick has made this will further help to combine the dough to top layer of the dough to the ones at the bottom so that when you remove your stuffed cookie later on it wouldn't just split and separate so once you done doing that for all of your cookies just cover it with plastic wrap and stick into the fridge for another 20 minutes you want to make sure that your dough is completely firmed and chilled before you stick it into the oven here you can see that while the dough are soft I wasn't able to merely get the size to be smooth because it can be quite hard to work with when it's still soft so after you remove it from the fridge again just press it firmly to get rid of all those lines and soon as you're happy with it just make sure your dough is still firm which it should because this wouldn't take too long just stick it into your oven that has been preheated at 175 degrees Celsius bring that down to 160 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes and then move it back up to 175 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes once you are done with that remove it and let it cool completely before taking your stuffed cookies out of the pan when removing it just try to gently twist your cookies around to make sure that it isn't stuck to your pan at all that's why greasing it up really well is very important so once you do that you can remove it rather easily and then you just place it on a flat pan and then bake it for another 2 minutes at 175 degrees Celsius leave this final step to when you're just about to serve them because these taste amazing warm the Nutella and peanut butter inside just oozes out this warm crusted slightly chewy cookie and oh my god seriously guys just try it and let me know how it goes for you well until next time I am Cheryl and from cherry Leeds cupcakes [Music] now here's a little tip if you accidentally removed your cookies a bit prematurely before they are fully cooled chances are they're going to fall apart and look like a big hot mess like this not to worry we will not waste your efforts because here now you can make these delicious peanut butter and Nutella cookie bars okay so just chop it all up and mix it well until it comes into this fine crummy texture you", "ejFqxK9r2-o": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make homemade peanut butter cups in miniature and this is what they look like now I've made them in with the paper candy cups so when you peel back the paper you get a really nice fluted edge and inside lots of dark chocolate surrounding a creamy smooth peanut butter filling so good now while they may look difficult they really are quite simple to make now for this recipe we're going to make 36 miniature peanut butter cups so line your your muffin pan with these little paper liners they're they're called paper candy cups you can get them in all different colors I'm just using the dark brown and you can buy these in like cake decorating stores party stores cookware stores or you know even online so the first thing we're going to do is our peanut butter filling which we're going to make in the microwave so it's really simple Yule so use a microwavable Bowl and so you need 1/2 a cup which is about 125 grams of smooth I like use a creamy smooth peanut butter and I like to use a peanut butter with a stabilizer in it which most commercial brands have and then to that I'm going to add two tablespoons 28 grams of butter you can use either salted or unsalted and have it at room temperature because then it go a little faster in the microwave and along with that I'm going to add just a pinch of salt if you don't want to you can leave it out but just a pinch like an eighth of a teaspoon so now what I'm going to do is put this in the microwave for about maybe a minute but you just want to melt it like get it's well not melted sorry you want to just get it kind of smooth not completely melt it where it's really liquid so what I do is every 20 seconds take it out give it a stir because you don't want it to melt all the way okay so our peanut butter is nice and smooth this is what you're looking for like I said watch it carefully because depending on your microwave and the peanut butter may take less may take more so then now what I'm going to do is stir in 1/2 a cup 55 grams of confectioner sugar you may know that is powdered or ice and sugar and I did sift it because powdered sugar tends to have lumps and just add that stir it in and essentially that's our peanut butter filling nice and smooth now if you found it it was a little too thick you could just pop it back in your microwave get a little softer but that looks good oh I can really smell right these are just so good ok so that's that's essentially our filling so I'm just going to put that aside because we're done and next are we're going to melt our chocolate so get a saucepan of water and bring that up to a simmer and then of course you need a heatproof bowl and our chocolate now you can use I'm using actually a combination of dark chocolate and milk chocolate because I find all milk chocolates just a little too sweet for me so I kind of find that 5050 is is about right and so but you can vary that those proportions to whatever you want really so I'm using 9 ounces which is 260 grams of dark chocolate which is either again depending on on how sweet you want them to be you can use the semi-sweet or a bittersweet chocolate if you go by percentage I'm using I think it's about a 61% which is kind of on that not quite a bittersweet but it's a little high on the semi-sweet and then to that I'm adding another nine ounces 260 grams of milk chocolate now I have the these little round disks but I bought the milk chocolate and bar form so I did finely chop that now you want to use this is you know a lot of times you give these as gifts so try to use a really nice tasting chocolate you know in bar form or you can buy in bulk but one that you just really enjoy just eating on its own and then to that just to kind of make turn that down a bit just to make your chocolate more like liquid smooth I'm going to add just 1 tablespoon of like a vegetable shortening or you could even Adam Laura it just kind of makes your choc a little more fluid and that's it for what we do for the chocolate part so I'm just going to put this over simmering water and melt it until it's nice and smooth okay as you can see our chocolate now I'll melt it so I'll just take it off the heat give it a good stir now this is this is just a little warm so what I'm going to do is just let this cool down just for a few minutes and when we come back we will make our peanut butter cups so now we're ready to make our peanut butter cups so what I've done is taken the my melted chocolate and put in a bowl just make a little easier and for the filling now you don't have to do this but I just put it in a piping bag because if you're really good at eyeballing you could just pipe all your peanutbutter filling but I'll show you that so first thing we need to do is take your and we're going to put 1 teaspoon so I'm actually using the teaspoon of the melted chocolate into the bottom of every one of the paper cups mmm-hmm almost there put this pin I'll just do this one pan show you how to okay so that's our first layer of chocolate so what I do is just take your pan a little bang gently on the camera so you can settle all that chocolate out and make a nice thin layer as you can see okay so that's our peanut butter or sorry our chocolate so now we need our peanut butter Center so again I have my tea spoon now if you were really good you could eyeball a teaspoon and pipe it but I'm not that good at that so what I do is just want to put a teaspoon and then I just use a little spoon this is kind of a little tedious part and you just kind of put it right in the center like so I see that and again just do that for everyone try to get it into the center if you can now if you have any really high peaks of the peanut butter just kind of take your finger or back of the spoon and just kind of press it down a little so that's our peanut butter filling so now we got to go back to our chocolate melted chocolate so again or in do is just take and pour a teaspoon over the top of each one okay so are almost done so what I like to do at this point because it looks like we may have to add a little more chocolate is just give our pan a good tap now you can see some have really settled out while some of the others I'm going to add a little more chocolate so just add a little more chocolate again tap your pan because because you don't want to see the little hump of the peanut butter okay I'm going to try again we'll see that's enough see a couple this is a these are easy as you can see with a little tedious but the rewards are great so I think it's worth it so that I'm pretty happy with that almost all kind of look around and see if the nice smooth tops so okay I think we're good so now you want to chill them probably your ball maybe 20 minutes just till they're nice and firm and then we come back we will try one okay so now our peanut butter cups have now chilled so I'm just going to take one out and we'll give it a try so you can just peel back and see very nice ridged edges and then I'll just cut one so you can see the inside so there we have it see the chocolate and then the peanut butter Center so good no people will not believe that you made these yourself they are just so good that chocolate and the peanut bar perfect combination so one quick note when you're making your peanut butter cups if you find that the your melted chocolate gets a little thick when you're trying to scoop it in you know either just microwave for just a few seconds or put it on over a saucepan of simmering water just to kind of thin it out because you're making a lot so the chocolate can thicken on you so okay these need to be stored in a covered container in the refrigerator and the reason for that is we did not temper the chocolate so if you let them at room temperature after a few days what you will find is on the chocolate it will get a little a dull and then you actually will get like a white bloom kind of a film on it and that's because we didn't temper the chocolate because that takes makes it kind of more difficult so we didn't do that and really I prefer them cold anyways or but you could you know store them in the refrigerator and then bring them to room temperature when you're about to serve them if you prefer it that way now these make fantastic gifts people just love them so what you can do is just go to your party store cake decorating store online or I mean and just buy a nice pretty colored box and just put them in and then maybe get some pretty ribbon and you have a great gift so enjoy and until next time I'm Stephanie drawers give joy baking calm [Music]"}
