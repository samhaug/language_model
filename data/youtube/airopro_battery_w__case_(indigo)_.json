{"xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "HxaXzw59RyY": "you're hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real matty

real Manny smokes alright guys you I'll see you on the next video peace", "VSyat0Zod40": "[Music] simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another bait cartridge for piyah Terry battery I would say I don't know if this is a 5-10 threading battery but it definitely looks different than your you know your typical 510 batteries usually they're like a pencil like cut the [ __ ] I mean they don't usually look like this but I mean similar and uh it's a cartridge as well and you can see I got the flavours sweater this is one of the sweaters they actually gave me it's probably like the only sweater a cat that gave the rest away but yeah I like to I like this color I got some water stains oh yeah this says AeroPro advanced vapor system premium carrying case not included but this box includes a vaporizer micro USB charger u.s. user guide and aluminum alloy body with the 320 milliamp per hour battery running it 8.5 power or 8.5 wattage power output so arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technology specifically designed for pure oils delivers superior performance and taste also has a one-year warranty as well to speak but it does say distillate so you know as far as just let's go they usually taste the same in terms of what terpenes they use when it whether it be fruity or whatever but this one apparently is Northern Lights two indica so let's just open some of these up so for uh what I mean by proprietary battery is batteries that you the cartridges only work for that specific battery I'm not saying like this is a proprietary battery or whatever like a rock garden car tree earth semi GE luck he likes to say proprietary battery a lot but proprietary battery only means when the powder you express it just like a plug-and-play like the only thing that's gonna work with the plug-and-play battery is a plug-and-play cart the raw garden carts you can use with any 510 threading cartridge the voltage might not be running as good for that specific cartridge because the raw garden cartridge is gonna run good for its own cartridges but you could still use it and that's that's what proprietary means it's it that only works for that you know 5-10 threading batteries raw iron batteries for all 510 threading so like this just make that clear you know just like he means well but that's what it means yeah and a lot of people don't really like proprietary batteries because it's like well I got to get this battery or this [ __ ] cartridge when you know 510 threading cartridges are Universal on most batteries so I do feel it but this one it kind of does look like this so it is a five strand by ten threading I believe [Music] in queen I also got my cousin on my bed back so we're gonna open this right off the bat when I took it out it smells really it smells like that the distillate like fire oh jeez from plug play like that very earth the tiny taste so I'm guessing this is just the then you take out okay hey so you charge on the bottom as well microUSB and like I said it's a 320 milliamp per hour battery so it's fairly alright I believe this one's like 400 so probably can get a decent amount of use before you have to charge it so so there is no button you just hit it and then those are light right here so we're just gonna hit it okay so you guys didn't see that because obviously you have to have like crazy-ass heists to see that but this actually vibrated while I was hitting it so you don't actually need to look at the light to see if you're actually getting anything because with this list sometimes you don't even know you're hitting it because it's a it's a very thin oil or I don't know what it's not really thin but yeah it's just sometimes when you're inhaling this lis it's sometimes you don't get the sensation that it's actually going into your lungs so the vibration is actually a good touch and I've actually seen this from Desmet before they had a few prototypes they let me try but they kind of look like this but they vibrated as well but this is the first American company I seen that implemented it so pretty good as far as the taste goes it kind of tastes like [ __ ] licorice I don't really like licorice okay you smell this real quick it's mostly it's not sweet has like a weird aftertaste I'm not really a fan of it but I will be smoking on it because until pretty I don't know I'm not a fan of licorice taste but you know like sweets I do and you like candy and [ __ ] yeah but not like one like sweet meat [ __ ] but overall I'm probably gonna try another one of these actually this is a proprietary battery I believe because this cartridge has the metal magnetic attachment stuck on it so you would have to have this cartridge to work with this battery so it is a proprietary battery in itself but overall it's a pretty pretty nice looking product not gonna lie it is running at 80% THC so it's definitely in the mid-range when it comes to cartridges and yeah I'm probably to take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it this is 0.5 as well and as far as pricing goes you're gonna probably put it in the post edit process because I don't know and there is good vapor production I'm not gonna lie that you pretty much saw all that cloud that came out other than that I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "VPqYXdOYa-I": "something that might help actually is taking a paper clip and just kind of getting that hole started a little bit see there that way it nice and easy and now I kind of got that area opened up a little bit because I mean the syringe diameter is a lot bigger than the paperclip diameter whoever's still kind of over the tip of the syringe there if I can get up a face see I just need to get that rubber to come off the tip of the syringe and then we can start deploying the oil I think actually I might have done it with the paperclip and that might have helped get the rubber kind of all the way out of the way and get broke off a piece of rubber oops okay well now it's in there I actually shoved it in there with the paperclip in there and then pulled the paper cut out so now the syringe is all the way into the cartridge and well now we want to give it slow twists and slowly let the oil come out of the syringe and we don't want to let the syringe come out of the cartridge while the pressure is being applied to the oil we're gonna pull the syringe on the cartridge we need to let the pressure stop being applied all right it's just uh can I buy everything give it a few twists oh I was going the wrong way the air comes and this part can be a little tedious but less is more with these twists because one little twist is gonna give you a good amount of oil that's not even like a quarter turn turning it like it was a clock like one hour if it was the hour hand it's pretty cool lives for sure [Music] so I hear on that side I probably like one more twist and then I'll have to let the air like move all the way to the top and the bottom by hitting it a couple times can just do that for you I definitely say the hardest part is getting that syringe into the rubber part but you know doing it a few times you'll get the hang of it and it'll become easier so now that I'm done and I want to pull the syringe out I'm going to twist it so that the the plunger moves back away so I know the oil isn't pressed up I like all the way against the top here and then let it kind of hang out for a second so that you know that you've sucked most of the oil I kind of out of that syringe I mean a little bit of oil might pop out with it something else that happened to me last time is this metal piece actually came off of the plastic for the tip of the syringe that metal piece there and this little piece there so I'd watch out for that but I was able to like push it back in what happened I mean definitely macgyvering this here but you know saving some money and it's gonna leave a little indent there you know looks like the oil might you know ease its way back out but the rubber roll will hold it it won't push past that rubber there what looks like just at the five minute mark there in the video so that's actually not bad I mean about five minutes to fill up the cartridge there and the paper clip technique I think definitely helped get the syringe into the cartridge there and I still have about half down of oil left in this guy here so I can fill up a whole nother cartridge I really hope this helps out Sarah happy holidays happy smoking", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "X57hkIS65UU": "what's up everybody's a boy mastermind here wild cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're talking about Buckeye release brand new product in partnership with the company called air pro these are 500 milligram or 1/2 gram babe cartridges so let's go ahead and jump in let's begin another mastermind here [Music] all right so let's start out with an unboxing here of at least one of the batteries in one of the cartridges and we'll talk a little bit more about it as we go I'll give you some more information let's jump in okay what you're looking at is an arrow pro advanced vapor system battery which comes in a nice box here as you can see and you get a carrying case in the USB charger and user guide that's a 320 milliamp battery this is in partnership with Buckeye relief so basically you know one thing that they're doing is they're offering a one-year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the all their vape cartridges all their vape cartridges come in 500 milligram leak free ceramic etat autonomous these are designed specifically for marijuana oil in our field with the following robust terpene profile so they have three different product lines the strain series which is high quality for technical terpenes formulated to replicate some of our favorite strains the live flower series which is 100% cannabis oil firm formulated with him to ride terpenes and also the live resin series which is high-quality fresh frozen live resin for the strange series they have three different ones they have jack herer which is a sativa blue dream which is a hybrid and Northern Lights which is an indica for the live flower series they have blue widow which is a high rip purple Hindu which is an indica and super silver which is sativa and last for the live resin series they have oral Blanco cocoa and straight saws the oral Blanco is an indica the straight salsa sativa and the cocoa is a hybrid so they have a pretty good variety as you're seeing with the battery as I'm showing you here it's this one is purple but they have a couple of different colors it basically is for regular micro USB chargers you're seeing and this clear piece that you're seeing here at the top that is actually a dummy tip so you basically had to remove that so so now I'm showing you the actual purple hindu vape cartridge and as you can see it's color-coded with the blue indica label and this as you see is a live flower series and you can see the test information right there and as you can see this package is sealed so I haven't opened it yet but I'm opening it for you guys in this review video and you know I think it's interesting that they're offering a one-year warranty and they're also with the battery and a 30-day warranty with the vape carts let me know if you ever come across another vape cart or vape battery that comes with a one-year warranty I think that's a little bit different you know this particular company is it's been around for at least a couple years the box was dated 2018 so it's not a brand new battery company yes so this particular vape cartridge has a magnetic bottom so there is no thread so this will not work on any other 510 batteries that you may already have laying around the house so as I'm showing you here that you have to pull off this top piece and then you can see in there chamber there it is the magnet in there you pull off that clear piece it's kind of like a dummy tip once you clear that off then you can put the other part of the cat the cap I call it the cap back on and it won't work unless you have that cap back on there properly so at first I try to put it in without the cat pointer that didn't work out so well so you have to have this purple part that I'm showing you now all the way on there so even though it's a little bit of purple showing I actually don't have it all the way push down but once you drop it in there the magnet sucks it right into it so it is connected instantaneously even if you turn upside down the cartridge will not fall out so again I think it's very interesting that this particular VAE cartridge has a 30-day warranty and the battery has a wonder one year warranty so if you've seen another product like this in Ohio definitely let me know in the comments but I think this is the only product that I'm aware of that has a 30-day warrantee on the vape cart itself and a one-year warranty on the battery so I think that's pretty interesting so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys see what it's like for me to hit it and so here we go alright so definitely again I love the color and just to show you guys now close you can see that this is seated properly so all I do is just take a tote and right off I can taste some really great flavors taste fruity now something else I like about this is there's actually choke hold car by calm joke hold the carb hole so if you want to make it if you want to adjust the air flow there's a little hole there and that will affect the airflow that you get and so that makes a difference with the CBD it's definitely gonna have a good benefit for paying you're looking for something with pain you definitely want to get something that has CBD in it again like I was showing you an unboxing with the case it just kind of fits right in there and that's kind of easy as far as you just put your charger in there and I don't know you might take your dummy cartridge with you heck you might have another cartridge and you might have a setup like this you could have like a nice little medication pack going on I think that's cool and I like it they actually give it a little instruction menu that shows you exactly how to use the product I think that comes in quite handy and as far as you know I also have the oral blanco live resin one and I can tell you this tastes great this tastes like oral Blanco and I mean this this is one of my favorite pens so far in the whole program I love the color tips I like colors I like to the fact when you hit the battery or vibrates and like I said as far as prices goes they have three different price points 60 65 and 70 the 70 is the highest one for the live resin live resin cause a lot more to process than the basic THC oil and you know I just wanna let people know that I do a lot of reviews and I always hold on to my receipts and I think everybody in the program should be keeping their receipts and their containers just in case something ever happens you never know if this is gonna be a recall on something or an issue and since they're offering a one year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the actual cartridge it's definitely a good idea to hold on to the receipt and even here I've put my labels on the back so that's something you guys might want to start doing but definitely keep your receipt no matter what for at least up to one year and if you just can't keep paper receipts in there just want people don't like keeping that land around take a really high resolution photo with your phone or go ahead and scan it that's something I can recommend as well because that will always give you a digital record of when you buy it which you bought and then if you ever have to scrimp so you can prove that you actually purchased the item and that you paid for it so I think it's important to keep your receipt just want to touch base on that what you didn't see in me in the review was the other package is different where the alive resin it's a gold Cullen I already opened that one and that unboxing didn't go to where I wanted it to so I couldn't show you that one on camera but like I said it's very very good and it's worth every penny that I paid for it you know I definitely purchased the next the Coco one to try that one as well to see if it's just as tasty so with that I'm gonna tell you if you like what I did in this video make sure you like subscribe button I'm trying to get to

cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges with your vaporizer batteries if you'd like to learn more about their products here please visit NY vape shop comm if you want

cool-looking little package here it looks like a gift box because if I'm gonna have a fine little treat inside of here these are some earbuds air pod like air pod looking earbuds but of course a competitor from a brand a newcomer I don't know I haven't heard of them before happy plugs Stockholm if you don't know where Stockholm is that's in Sweden IKEA and pewdiepie that's what does the other things from Sweden happy plugs Stockholm everybody wants a piece of this market alright we talked recently on the loo later show downstairs about the note series Samsung getting rid of their mini jack connector so it's like everybody has to figure out now which wireless earbuds they want to use I did a video very recently on the new sony ones so then you have these upstart companies they're like we want a piece out market as well in this case it looks like they're squarely targeting the air pod customer because would you look at that tell me that doesn't look like an air pod did I miss something there's a message in here the fashion component comes down to the fact that we have some different colors available and actually there's some metallic touches first off they've done well with the packaging if you saw that in a store you saw that an Urban Outfitters they still have her been Outfitters you can see that you know about to cash out at the gadget shop you're like you know what I need a pair of those now I don't know how much they're gonna charge for these it's gonna be tough in this marketplace with something that looks so much like an air plug it's probably gonna have to be cheaper than an air plot is it cheaper than an air pod Willy dude it's 90 bucks now we got it now we got a story now we got a game plus you're charging case says Stockholm on it designed in Sweden manufactured in China well Apple does it so of course they're going to do the same classic white that is a direct air plug competitor at that point oh okay like a like a tan sort of gold that's the hearing aid the skin tone color Amy see it that's free it's for old man Jack last up we got black okay that's kind of a good look as well black so there's your four color options which one do you think I should do these guys okay cool 14 hours sweat resistance dual microphones and silicon sleeves 14 different touch commands high-quality audio Bluetooth five Oh certified quality is quality is certified and your like by who and I'm like me she's making me the gold one look pretty good actually so that's fine okay so first things first what are we gonna pull that out okay all right here's my first problem but I guess 90 bucks you can understand but it's micro USB charging no type-c love and 90 bucks I can accept that these are the silicon tips it's important to note here that there are all kinds of third-party products for air pods and ear pods before that that were kind of like these things right here to make the earbud fit a little better for some people and you had to pay extra and like order those off Amazon so it's nice they included it happy plug sticker and a user manual okay very nice ooh very lightweight I notice straightaway also the ear tip to me looks a tiny bit larger than an air pod only the case is small I think these things might be popular well they still got the gold touch on it I'd say it's utilitarian laughs oh there's a little magnet that grabs it a lot of people are strictly choosing the air pods because of convenience and a big component in a convenience category is part ability this gives it a run for its money on portability 1/2 feet I got the black ear plugs over there now that's still a bit smaller but man that's really similar territory from every angle height this might be a really valid airpot alternative for somebody wants to catch a deal and not spend 150 bucks I'm just gonna okay okay power on it says Oh [Music] power on pairing connected they are crazy comfortable now they do nothing for sound isolation I hear you I hear you there's nothing so don't get carried away well there's no noise cancelling going on but as a convenient headphone which is fully wireless call me crazy I'm gonna say these actually fit my ears a little tiny bit better than actual airpot hair new oh there we go straight away err one buy happy plugs boot up the music [Music] this one's it's just got Jack's head nodding [Music] so here's the thing these you can turn these up too much it will let you extend the volume into distortion territory which is like I would normally just boost headphones when I'm trying them here so it's maxed out almost by default but at that level I'm getting some crunch particularly in the base moments within a within a song if I turn it down two notches then it's right I would say it's almost in air pod wheelhouse so you got to be careful about that it's almost like the tuning is a bit messed up compared to the air pot I mean they don't even sound that great to begin with so I'm putting them in the same universe they do probably sound a bit worse but funny enough when it comes to air pods I don't use them for discerning music pump up scenarios I would use air pods for like podcasts or like listening to to a video playing something some dialogue the convenience factor is the selling point for me with the air pods in general it's the reason I use that so now I'm saying this sort of fills that convenient spectrum and it allows you to freeze up another 60 70 bucks to go out potentially get yourself like a wired pair of over ears when you want to get real I don't think this is mind blowing to deliver this for 90 I'd say the impressive part for me comes with the packaging of the whole thing not the packaging it ships in but like when you go to put it away this this it's hard to find things that are this portable other than the air pods as a truly wireless setup they're not gonna knock your socks off go watch the Sony video for that but for a dual headphones setup or for somebody who this but you know budget conscious setup this this is gonna be alright", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "o-O0rVIvjRE": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're doing our very first-ever cartridge review and this one were is going to be on the Indigo pro midnight moon cartridge with that let's just get into the numbers I'm gonna pretend like I've done these all the time and then I'll kind of explain in the end why I don't really do this so with that let's get into the numbers this says this is harmony farms distillate so harmony farms is gonna be the farm who produced it THC content comes in an eighty two point six five percent I'm not sure and I'm not a hundred percent sure as far as like what the strain is or anything I think this is just like they're you know indica blend so to speak and then it's flavored with blackberry and blueberry flavoring this is a distillate for those of you who don't know what that is it's a like it's an already activated THC I believe and with that let's go ahead and pop it open there's not a whole lot to it I do like the packaging it looks nice on a show it this just looks pretty I guess I can talk about why I don't really do cartridge reviews so I don't like pens pens usually tend to not be that great I personally don't like how they hit outside of maybe when you're going on a trip I don't really see why you would ever use a pen if you're you know somebody who can actually dab and enjoys the process of hitting the torch and doing all that stuff then a pen is kind of just like it takes all that romance away so but I do understand how a lot of the newbies and a lot of the older people who are coming into cannabis now might be really interested in this and this has been my favorite pen for multiple reasons the biggest one being how easy it is to use you don't see a single button right here because you don't need it I'm gonna do a review on this soon with that I'm gonna go ahead and open this up hopefully I didn't just break that and let's see so basically this is all you got to do oh this is did the distillate as you can see there's not a whole lot to it I can't you know it's taste it I can't smell it I can't do anything once it's in it because it's in here so this is how you put in a cartridge and that's it it's ready to go you just start pulling on that but with that I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this hey guys what's up so today I'm gonna go ahead and test out the midnight moon cartridge over the last few days I have been smoking on it but I wanted you guys to really kind of see what this looks like so this is an integral the Indigo pro pen the midnight moon is is bottom cartridge down here as you can see this is a cool little pack so you can carry you're a little like Arsenal right there it's just out one of the things that I do want to point out about this little tool is the fact that these cartridges are magnetic so if you're somebody who struggles with screwing things on or doing anything like that and you just need something that's super convenient this thing's pretty much gonna do that for you because you put it in just a little bit and then the magnet takes over for you and I'll do that again just so you guys can really check that out so slide it right in pulls it in and then another reason why I think the older people are really going to enjoy this because it's super simple there's not a single button on that entire thing there's only one thing you have to worry about that's your charger you plug it in after you plug it in put that thing in you pull [Music] yeah you get big heads out of this thing no struggling nothing crazy oof now let's talk about the flavor as far as the flavors concerned this stuff has it tastes like black and blueberries straight up it's just taste like almost like kool-aid and sweet and sorry I'm a little bit Joe this is still distillate so it does kind of do that to you as far as the highest concern this is something that's a little bit more relaxed happy kind of stony too though so there's a daytime one that we have and then this one's more of like the nighttime I would say this is very much a nighttime one because you hit it and you do kind of feel that like laziness kind of wave kind of go through your body and you relax so if you're a newbie or if you're somebody who doesn't smoke concentrates a lot this is something that you're gonna want to smoke after you're done with your day kind of chilling and hanging out and you're just watching TV and you don't need anything you know you don't need to think or do too much you just want to smoke and then rock yourself off to bed this is going to be perfect for that with all that if you guys do enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "APKXe_Fii-k": "hey guys his nap connection we're doing a comparison of the arrow Pro versus the vessel battery and we're gonna be using an actual C cell on the vessel battery so a couple things I should mention the vessel is getting a lot of height because it's well it's really nice but it is very expensive it was $99 the arrow pro on the other hand most people think of it as $35 but that's actually when you buy it with the case you may find it at some dispensaries and if they don't give it to you at first ask for it say you guys have the battery only because the battery only it was only 15 bucks and that's really not that bad I got to say overall though the vessel hits harder than the arrow pro I still love arrow Pro the quality of the oil is excellent I'll still be getting over cartridges but I do think the vessel that's harder and I'll do a compare compares hit both them here first we'll start the arrow I mean you're opposed to Hut's great and here's the vessel on a Cecil specifically on arutz cartridge actually you know also being able to hold the button here gives a little bit advantage but you notice as you get deeper into the hit with the vessel it just starts hitting harder and harder and that's why over all minutes have to say the vessel hits harder than the arrow Pro it just does arrow Pro still great still gonna get it vessels 100 bucks but I gotta say a vessel so far is the best battery I've used for cartridges and I'm primarily using sea salt cartridges and I say it's only a battery I've had that actually works better than the the Palmer Cylon sea salt carts now is it worth 99 you know if you hit a lot of cards probably if you don't maybe not I think it is a bit expensive you know $4.99 like see made in USA stuff if they could like it like just wood was like handcrafted in America or something maybe I'd feel a little bit better but the thing 99 but the reality is if you're spending 40 50 bucks of cartridge and it does hit that much better yeah it's probably worth it it really does hit nice so I give both these products to thumbs up but that's just your comparison of you know the vessel in the arrow Pro thanks for watching guys is that connection have a great week and I'll also be giving away one of these vessel batteries and we'll have info on that below thanks for watching guys have a great week", "rRqRobaMKf8": "[Music] it's Colorado Kerry coming at you today with a review of our cannabis products with the hub's managing a recreational store we get the chance to try out a lot of really cool new interesting property and today I am going to bring you one of my favorite things ever it is the Indigo Pro advance of vapor system as you can see it's also right over there alright so what I'm gonna do is just basically take out what you get in the Box tell you how much it costs and where you can get it what you get in the box is first as you can see to whatever direction that is to me a sweet sweet case I freaking love this case it is so handy and nice and keeps things all super together I love it I love it the way you get inside is the battery now as you can see here maybe you can see it yeah it says indigo Pro and the purple one of course it also says there's this other little piece there's no need for you to ever take that off so just leave it on there alright so inside the case we've got case the battery pack this is very important the charger pretty easy USB very handy nice and the little Direction ebook the thing here so the user guides pretty self-explanatory it's like a page long so it's not a big deal at all so now what else you need to know this is just the battery so you're gonna have to buy yourself a cartridge now before we get into the cartridge I do want to let you know that you can pick up this battery for about thirty dollars at a dispensary near you these are only sold in the state of Colorado in Washington so yeah you'll have to you have to go there to get one alright so now back to the cartridges the next thing that you're gonna have to do is purchase some of that sweet sweet weed oil this is my favorite one that indica one it is called Knight Rider the flavor is a sugar plum so the cartridges come in other flavors as well there are different types they have sativa and the two flavors for sativa right now are blood orange and apple berry and then the indica flavors are sugar plum and black and blueberry I like both of those flavors but I really like the sugar plum is so delicious oh my god they also have it in hybrid which is a combination of the indica and sativa those flavors are mint and cinnamon and finally they have a CBD two-to-one and they call the flavor harmonium so I'm assuming that it's just terpenes that are flavoring that more on terpenes in a later video otherwise you can check out my blog at the bottom and I did link to a little description of it below there so each one of these little cartridges that you have here they are half a gram of pure cannabis oil now these are also impressively high potency for instance my cartridge that I just have been using recently it comes in at seventy four point six seven percent THC that is crazy high amazing I have seen some like hubs just got one for himself a different brand not this but it came in at like eighty nine percent or something which is just nuts these cartridges the half gram of oil which is what you're gonna need to go along with your battery pack they're gonna run you about $45 no you might think oh my god that cost so much but really they last a long time like a really long time I use them a lot and weren't totally totally great also a quick special note most batteries and cartridges that you purchase at the store they are all interchangeable the Indigo pro is not interchangeable this is like the Mac version of vapor pin so none of the things actually go together within the other products do not let this deter you however I still love it I love it so much okay what makes the Indigo pro extra special okay so first off they're magnetized it's a magnet it sticks to things that are magnets I can't even like it is so cool okay and so I don't know if you can hear it or not oh so we've got this [Music] yeah it's so you know I'm putting it over here because my mic is stupidly on this side I hope you can hear me you guys okay so that's enough of that it's magnetized also sticks to things like your refrigerator it doesn't hold it's not super strong so be aware of that also it vibrates yes I said that but not like I mean you have to be sucking on it for it to vibrate so it's so nice it's like a wonderful little like like fluffy like nice little vibration okay now the reason I really like the vibrating part that is one of the reasons I like it is that it means there's no on/off button if you look it's just the thing that's where it plugs in there but yeah there's nothing it's just literally it goes in you put it in there we suck on it when the battery starts to get low it pulses back at you so if it were becoming low I would suck on it and then it would just move back to let me know that it was close and it would do mm-hmm so twice if it was really close three times this was super close like 10% and then when it finally dies it does it ten times and then just kicks the bucket charging is super fast too so I kind of like it behold no having to turn it on and turn it off makes us so the battery life on these are super good for you know people who might be forgetful so yeah extra plus I'm sure that you've already noticed it's like a weird kind of see it's a cool little shape it feels really nice in your hand I like that it's slightly larger than a pin most of the time I don't even have another one on my desk I'll show you but a lot of times they're exactly the same size as a writing utensil and so it's kind of hard to find it when it's in the bottom of my purse I really like this indigo Pro I've tried out lots of other little batteries and pans and I don't not like any of them this is just seriously yeah it's the best okay well I think that that's that's it if there is a cannabis product that you would be interested in see me do a review of let me know down below in the comments and I'll do my best to come across that and get a hold of it and

would have a different intro I hate seeing that but getting in front of camera is like really awkward for me still test now this new best dab pen compared to my last one this baby still rips it's called pulse battery $80 on dispensaries but now I believe it's down to $60 so if you want to actually I can't promote selling things or buying in these videos so don't [ __ ] buy it okay may have unboxed it already now may I put it back in the package just for this but comes in the little arrow Pro this my first time on a camera by the way I just bought it um a g7x I've never had a camera before usually I just use my [ __ ] iPhone but hopefully this is better so get this little bad boy here let me let me just [ __ ] pan over for you guys alright alright this what we're looking at this is the new guy little arrow Pro sweet little box but basically it takes different carts than a normal one like these ones you know any normal cart goes on that but these ones check it out alright don't [ __ ] blame you for my camera skills I don't even know what the [ __ ] I'm doing here okay yeah you take this damn it's a [ __ ] magnet needing this no button nice [ __ ] dough compared to this one this one rips but there's a button it's gonna be a smoke you wanna hear today whoo yo beam in our cameras [ __ ] dough I'm gonna review these [ __ ] carts now we got this badass pen now we got to put a car in it okay we obviously did that it's the Northern Lights is what we're having it is a 86% you know me I'd be rocking with the indicas I don't know about you guys put in the comments what's your favorite strain I'm really obsessed with indica cuz honestly I just like to smoke alone you know I still get my [ __ ] done because we can't have stoners out here not getting their [ __ ] done I still be getting stoned and going about my day it's gonna work he had done about to be moving so hopefully I make a vlog out of that skirting my way out of [ __ ] Idaho back to the hometown Seattle where Lee ro weed is legal so I don't get no more [ __ ] trouble here been in way too much trouble lately with the law first strain ever invented and it was because this dude grew in Alaska and like Aurora lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __ ] from Alaska as well obviously BAM first two strains I actually really like this these flavors good as [ __ ] just don't know it but I've been sitting in this chair for like 15 minutes just on my phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned sitting here um anyways let's move on wait let me take another rip I'm gonna give this a score 1 out of 10 but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you that like a seven we are now having wedding pie it is a 82% in because well you know how it is I always be wrong with the indica what I need to do whoa this one looks cool that's badass look at it it's wedding pie by the way Wow smells like [ __ ] dang boys I'm really [ __ ] hungover today and the alcohol is trying to come out of my system no sir that was that you gotta see this [ __ ] I'm over here [ __ ] dying now hey don't me in the comments call me a [ __ ] [ __ ] okay I'm hungover as [ __ ] I have an 8 I'm ripped as [ __ ] and I keep [ __ ] coughing this alcohol whoa but I'm doing it for the [ __ ] content okay normally I would just be in the [ __ ] bathroom and I would just [ __ ] I mean I didn't puke I don't know why I'm saying it like that I ain't no [ __ ] any of this one's strong as hell it's killing me every time I hit it okay I've only hit it two times and every time I've been almost yakking now hey again don't call me a [ __ ] but my the [ __ ] alcohol is trying to come out I'm gonna give that a six out of ten maybe a seven sis I'll go 6.5 pull it out okay next one the OG bubba kush indica of course i only go with the indica sativa sometimes when I'm working but most of time I say [ __ ] it and I just at work hi I'm kidding I'm kidding my [ __ ] employer finds this well sir we have a 90 percent coming in at 91% for bubba kush let's test it out damn this so bright that I look white oh wait I am white I just look pale suppose all right not gonna lie another [ __ ] ten minutes has gone by of me just sitting here doing nothing cuz I'm so [ __ ] stoned like I've just lost track of time I don't even know what one I'm on oh I'm on the bubba kush okay i'll give that like an eight matter of fact I'm gonna bump the other ones up to the first one was honestly the best I want to give the first one like a nine now I don't know what I gave it before but it probably wasn't the [ __ ] nine wedding Paiwan [ __ ] me up also wedding pie is the only door cord all right end result Northern Lights nine wedding pie 7.5 bubba kush hmm probably an 8 probably an 8 this one is fruity pebbles or Strawberry Cough honestly I've lost so many [ __ ] cards I don't know which flavor is which okay is smaller this one was more expensive this was a little cheaper just because I got it on a sale at the dispensary all right boys that's been the [ __ ] video I'm going to turn this camera off and sleep actually it's Sunday so I'm gonna watch the football game Packers are on in three hours let's go I almost forgot to do one more red", "GfWxGtiExh4": "what's going on guys keep calm back with another video and in this one we got an aeropro cart this is some clementine it's a hybrid as you see and uh this one's only testing out at 79.9 percent so i'm hoping the terps are pretty high on this one to make up for the lack of uh let me thc something real quick to slice this all right perfect hopefully you guys are having a good day oh push here all right there we go and that's how that comes if you guys haven't seen these take a certain battery you have to buy the aeropro battery and it has a slight vibration i've only had one other one so let's go ahead and drop it in drops right in a pretty big head space but uh let's go ahead and give it a taste test and i remember these are finicky it's going to take a second to get that vibration to hit yeah that's the one bad thing it took me forever to get this so it's pretty much a fail a strong citrusy taste definitely the only bad thing as you see it took about six or seven draws to even get that connection and you gotta suck hard too the only good thing these are good for i would say i mean not the only good thing but if you have like a vision problem or anything like that to where you can't really tell how much you're intaking with the whole vibration you can tell exactly how much you're getting every hit right when that vibration hits that's when the smoke comes in so you can kind of time it that way but yeah i mean it hits you pretty good it's just i would rather go with another like verano or revolution or something like that instead of this especially with this battery you got to have in the vibration it's super finicky but it's not bad you guys like this video go ahead and give it a thumbs up comment subscribe and we'll see in the next video very soon peace guys", "ZN9vFY9hdlk": "they're going oh yeah it's going everybody check this out there's a new thing and try out I don't know if you can read it play backwards it says AeroPro a ir o PR Oh check this one out yeah so this is a battery it's Calexico and shaped and over here you keep your cartridges and you just go like this magnetic and ready to go and if you want to switch kinds from your huckleberry mango twist to your [ __ ] pineapple butthole surprise you just magnetic slip right loop and there's no light on it it vibrates it vibrates so I wish you could hear you might be able to hear it anyway I guess you could like stick it up somebody's butt or other orifice and then suck on it and it would vibrate that would be kind of cool I'm weird I'm weird for you even thinking that but anyway it's called AeroPro and it's this pretty cool thing you can hold up to six cartridges and the thing goes in there and this is the only battery on the market that you can use while it's charging you can charge you can be charging it and still use it works pretty good anyway check it out I don't know how much the cost this was a vendor gift which is one of the perks of having your wife work at a pot store anyway that was my review of the arrow Pro I guess it's a vape pen that's a vape pen it's awesome because it has magnetic cartridges that just pop out just slip in about the screw nothing until you're done getting stoned huh and then it's got this little plastic thing that goes in it for storage put this back in there like that move it up and you're on your way okay that was my arrow Pro review see you guys", "bIo1LfSMiJ4": "all right here we're gonna be talking specifically about mountain mists and so AeroPro makes different strains of course I believe this is one of the artisan flavors so it does seem like there's some kind of flavors added to it but it still has a really high over 85% THC has a minty menthol taste to it when you exhale it's actually really nice I'm usually not a big fan of flavors and I kind of sometimes get a headache a feeling from flavored ones but this one really doesn't do that really clean uses the same seesaw hardware as the other AeroPro now I want to see our main arrow Pro review for more information just on arrow Pro in general but it's pretty much a system where you're using this fake battery and this is more just specifically about mountain mists so tastes excellent strength excellent this is probably one of the best cartridges I put this up there with the best lately but triangles probably roots I put this up there with roots this is the best arrow Pro cartridge I've had so far overall you can definitely give it two thumbs up and let's give it a hit so you can just see how the whole thing goes and that egg there that's one problem actually half of their approach sometimes just stops so as you can see nice hits yeah overall two thumbs up for the mountain missed a little more detailed in-depth written review you can link to below there's dampen action have a great week and thanks for watching", "0JmQ1VIZgxE": "hey guys so first of all let me say that I live in Colorado and I'm over 21 so this is completely legal for me except on a federal level hopefully gets federally legalized soon I think it would be a good idea um this video is gonna be kind of shitty cuz it's my second video like what do you expect you know third of all if you have a low tolerance this chronic is probably not for you okay because it's very powerful I took one hit off of it I was gone I thought I thought I was dying I was like take me to the ER please because it was terrible like a but once the dying part could have stopped it was okay like I was just really stoned but the dying part wasn't very fun but it lasted like an hour so if you have a lower tolerance I wouldn't recommend this product for you so let's get on with this review I'm really just gonna be showing you the product and what what it is so that comes in this nice box which I have effectively destroyed up here and then it comes in a little box in the box and then in the box in the box it's a case so you know this is fancy right it comes with its own like carrying case that says arrow Pro on it so inside the case inside the box inside the box there's a little charging cord a little like four page manual it's very very small very small and then we have the thing itself the thing that almost killed me the arrow Pro it's like a decagon shape I don't know if you guys can see that very well it vibrates when you take a hit off of it which is really weird the cartridge is magnetic so you can just pull it out and drop it in and it connect which is nice you don't have to screw it in but like I said you know this thing isn't for me and in the carrying case it looks like this fancy unit even has places to put your other cartridges if you want to collect other cartridges for it so I guess that's pretty cool I guess this is more for like dab and smoke every day all day every day smoker stoners you know and the cartridge came in this package it you know it's is childproof it come it came in a little little plastic box inside the package to keep it from rattling around in the bottom and possibly messing it up good choice I had my first experience with his vape a few weeks ago and it was kind of bittersweet cuz like I said felt like I was dying for a good I want to say an hour cuz but you know time gets all screwed up but and then once I was done dying I just felt really stoned you should have seen me go to the like kitchen cuz I was like venturing to the kitchen I bet I looked super stupid on my way there and I had grabbed a little asipi cup out of the cupboard and it was so much work to get water from the sink into that sippy cup and then into my mouth and then set the sippy cup down that's how high it was it was ridiculous it like in conclusion this this vape would be very good for if you dad wouldn't smoke all day for people with high tolerances because the cartridge is a distillate it's very powerful I leave an article about distillates in the description but yeah I wouldn't recommend it if you have a very low tolerance they're kind of expensive too so and I don't even know if they're sold outside of Colorado who knows maybe they are well thanks for watching this very short second video I'm NAT and I'm gonna be out a piece", "QLhppSATkwY": "hey guys is Deb connection and we are doing a comparison of the arrow Pro versus the Z versus the Jeep NGO and the Jeep NGOs actually had close to empty so zero pro so hopefully the hits come out okay but I'll still explain to you the differences and what I kind of think is the better hardware what has a better oil and all that so first we'll talk about the hardware AeroPro is made by Cecil and it's a ceramic core but it's basically a C cell in a different format the steezy is also a ceramic core it is made by Ald which is another popular company probably the second most popular to see cell it's also a ceramic core it's the same Hardware heating element that is used in the plug play if you're familiar with that is just a different looking format the Jeep NGO I am Not sure on the Chinese manufacturer behind it but it is some kind of proprietary system that is only 2 geo it is not a ceramic core it burns off a wick well vapes off the wake Bob you've hit it light enough I don't know if you hit it light if it will burn out but I know if you hit a little bit too hard it definitely gets Bernie and if you search Jeep NGO breakdown you can see our breakdown of the inside of that and that's the only one that's not the ceramic core so these two have superior hardware I like the arrow Pro a little bit better than this TV hardware however I really need to try this again with better oil to get a fair look at those two but both these two I say are good hardware and if you want something just like the steezy but rather put your own oil in it check out the Ald V fire that is gonna have the same heating element that is the same thing that is used on the plug play the Jeep NGO because it burns off the wick has substantially worse Hardware it actually has a better form factor the battery actually feels cooler in your hand there's actually a lot to like about the Gio it's just the main most important part of it which is the core of the heating element which is essentially like your engine is not that good if they change the core in this it might might very well be the best hardware okay now let's talk about oil so AeroPro makes their own oil steezy makes it an oil and g-pen does not make their own oil so you're getting different oil producers in inside the geo pods and there's a bunch of different brands out there okay so comparing the oil to oil a lot of the people that make oil they were Pro and cz Eric low just blows it away steezy was really strong at the end of 2017 when it first came out it had a wider oil or clear kind of cut oil much lighter color and it was really good I mean steezy at the time was probably the best and or even early early 2018 weren't the best or the best when the new the newer see so hardware which this is based on has also brought up the hit strength just Dizzy's hardware it's just there oil is just so weak now essentially at this point when I have a steezy left which I got this one just to retry it I essentially consider myself like I'm out of stuff it's really just there's just no strength on this and when it comes to the oil compared to the other stuff so oil to oil AeroPro just destroys easy and AeroPro is is like one of the best brands you can find and it's a multi-state brand so the the quality on the oil is just better it's stronger it tastes better AeroPro hands-down winner over steezy now jeep NGO does have some really good oil pen makers that are behind it one of them in particular that i know of is the BAM pods from a company called body in mind and I don't know why they use the Geo it would be way better off in something else but make a very clean be hol for a vape pen that's it's hard to see I don't really see that often where there's a straight B hol card or parts or pods that you know are mixed with something but they're excellent pod so I really do like those but overall is the overall package aero pro is the winner and that's because oil is good and the hardware is good so both good hardware best oil worst hardware has some good companies that make some good oil for it though but really you're burning a wick and that's what's not good now let's do a hit of all of them you can see how they all hit and hopefully there's enough oil in there for that so hold on one sec okay first gonna hit the arrow Pro you know something's out there that say taro Pro produces three times more vapor I don't know that like if you have a really good battery like that vessel battery for example I think I don't know that it's necessarily three times more it does produce great amount of vapor the vibrating thing you get used to it I like the battery but yeah it's good now let's do steezy yeah the hardware hits good I think honest tastes easy doesn't taste bad either it's just there's just like no strength on these things and you know the last batch of these so the end of 2017 they're great you know early 2018 they're pretty good mid 2018 they just got super weak and I was like you know maybe this is just this batch I got six of them I thought maybe they're fake or something I wouldn't got another one this is that pure light from Placerville so I know 100% legit and it's just no strength like to me like I gotta hit this over and over again and I barely get the effect I get hit this twice and that's literally better painting this ten times 100% hitting this twice better than ten times hitting this twice is better than just hitting this all as much as you could possibly hit it really just this you just don't get that much effect off it's really disappointing because it was such a good product before and I really hope steezy makes a stronger line I've heard that the reasons TZ is so weak now is they're trying to appeal more to a mainstream audience and you know maybe people like us just need something that's too strong so maybe they can do it select it like select for a while head select oil and select the lead I don't know if they still do that elite so stronger one you know Stevie you can come out with that and a 20-17 I'll make a stronger one it's gonna be a top product again no here's the Geo and this is nothing I don't like about the Geo so it actually kind of really done so at the end right here but you can just see the inefficiencies in that you know there's a lot of inefficiency it just like oil getting stuck kind of on the side and things like that plus absorbs orbed into a wick which is probably you know longer if you look at the wick with it's broken down it's definitely bigger it seems at least in the Cotton's that they use in the other ones you know take a look at fishin see here so the steezy pod is actually fairly efficient you know so it goes down there AeroPro that's really efficient so started to efficiency in there let's see if this works the other thing to the G pod the Geo pods are real actually really tricky sometimes and see look now it's not working so I actually got to do my fix and this happens quite often they get stock I just suck from the other side to make the airflow go and then it'll work I'm gonna pause doesn't be difficult if I gotta put paperclip in there okay so I broke the air through now let's put this pot on so the G the G low hits good bet if I take way too big of a hit it's just going to get super Burnie and that's kind of that's kind of a down point but that that well from bama is very good they got great oil I hope I hope Gio makes this core better and they got a solid solid solid product steezy go back to them to 2017 oil and you got a solid solid product AeroPro is a very very solid product and one of the best base you're gonna get anywhere and you can go get them in multiple states which is also a plus so there's my comparison arrow Poe versus TZ versus Geo intro Pro clear winner on all fronts steezy still great hardware Geo good oil makers needs improvement thanks for watching guys have a great week", "YgaKQ-CKoFk": "yo Oh Oh yo Oh oh that's too long already hey guys

gonna review this [ __ ] new pen that I just got it's called the arrow pro to stop the whole [ __ ] pen doesn't even look that much like look like a pen looks like some kind of like my grandparents have diabetes they have today you know like prick themselves with like this whooping it looks like one of those that's what it looks like to me because it looks like that just like a little cylinder has a little tip it is press a button phone like I need we'll just fix them so they could check the blood and [ __ ] but yeah this is the arrow Pro it's super interesting honestly was it was weird they had a promotion there where I was where I was at the dispensary I was at but here is here's the package it came in the package it came in yeah it's arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technologies specifically designed for Peter oils deliver superior performance and taste and this has like a one-year warranty included cartridges were sold separately yeah this is it's pretty cool it seems like it's made in China but yeah the arrow pro it's crazy it has no lights or anything it has a light - like in the cake when it's charging and when it's done charging but that's pretty much it like it is really I'm gonna take a pull from so you guys could see it doesn't light up or anything but here we go cheers everybody I hope you got a smoke come on tapping mom whatever you guys are doing as long as he doesn't getting high here with me but here we go everybody Cheers [Music] anything rips that's the thing that's the thing I like about it if it's it's pretty good but the thing that I think is the craziest is that this thing vibrates when you hit it like it's not like and then like an aggressive vibration it's just you know you just feel you know it just you know it vibrates it to let you know that you're taking a hit since it has no but no lights no buttons or anything like that you need to know I'm getting it so it has a culture that literally just vibrates and [ __ ] so I think that's cool I mean I guess I have in comparison I have this desire here it's a BAM oh that's a sticker that I put on there but it's strong and I just picked this up yesterday comparing these cuz I mean I guess we could compare them this one you know it lights up it has a little lights at the bottom this is a regular state everybody know is dizzy they just came out with the big sticky which is something I want to review so if you guys want to see that video hit that like down there comment below and I'll [ __ ] make a video on that but give me like this real quick cheers everybody we got some strong Hannah right here I really like this runner runner is really good it kind of tastes like smoothie but well yeah we got this ones I mean I like it it's pretty cool only there's there's downsides to it so I'll do the pros and cons on it so this right here the pros and cons of this is the pros know it's stuffy as [ __ ] like this this is all it is charges to the bottom right there yes we got this right here charging for it super stealthy it's like magnetic and it's like not even like that's all nother thing right there I guess we could compare and I mean it doesn't really make a difference but this one right here you know it's not gonna fall off it won't fall off but this one like it takes it takes quite force to like you know it's a pretty strong magnet is what I'm saying so your cartridges I'm just gonna slip off or anything what else I think honestly those are the only pros you know it oh it doesn't have a light so I mean that's why I think it's so [ __ ] stuffy because you could just hit this anywhere in the dark in the movies like and I don't think anybody would know if you just blow it down and [ __ ] and you just you know goes to hit or something but yeah this is pretty cool I like it the only the piece of these are the cons because it only comes in half grams so you only gonna be able to get this review and I didn't be able to get a full Brasco the other con is at the 40 bucks each [ __ ] halftime cartridge that's another Angus it's another Pro that it's Inc it's pretty good [ __ ] weed like I don't know where where I left the bag I [Music] threw it away but the bag where this comes in doesn't even come in like a little case or anything it just comes in a bag it just gives you although they has CBD has THC all that and the percentages the tested percent you know will they tested it out and and that's another Pro you know it's it's a good quality oil it's a good quality cartridge everything's good quality it's just that it's 40 bucks for a half gram where I could buy heavy hitters for like 40 bucks and that's a foreground I could buy a freaking brass knuckles 45 program but that's over here in Cali and where I live so I don't know exactly what what it's lucky for you to stick your in but you know I think it's not worth it for the money but that they had a deal where if you buy the cartridge you get the battery for free and the battery is 40 bucks itself so that's like easily 80 bucks just to get a half gram cartridge and abetik so it's kind of cool it comes with this case oh my god like it's a pretty cool case I bet you charge as well but has a little station where you want to put your battery you can put you up your cartridges right there it's pretty cool the display came with like a bunch of them so like display her all of them fall and I kind of thought you know it was gonna come like that with all of them like an empty empty ones just there you know but it didn't it just came with it just came with the one the battery in the and the charger and some like you know little papers inside there that were like their their brand and I think some instructions but I mean I honestly done them take a look at the instructions I think the structures are still in the box but I'll take a look at them later but yeah this is a it's it's it's pretty [ __ ] interesting it looks honestly looks weird little ass [ __ ] fanny let's see the size difference this dizzy isn't over smart [Music] honest I prefer this dizzy it's it's cheaper that could also mean cheaper quality oil I'm not sure I think it's pretty good but then again these these are 65 for full graph so it's still you're still paying good amount the only thing is that it get pays off with the with the battery because the battery is only 20 bucks so but yeah that's that's that's my review on this you know I really like that it's it's kind of small it really looks it's kind of weird so like I'm not sure if it's like it like at first I'm seeing I don't know if it's uh if it's just like a big pen like I don't even it is a kind of doesn't even look like a cannabis fan other than the color I [ __ ] I mean it comes with red once it comes with orange ones and the color I got maybe that might give away its sweet cuz it's a green but other than that I don't think anybody would know it doesn't light up like if you want to hit in the dark you're not gonna you're not gonna see a little little light but it does vibrate so it gets a good full as well like the air feels pretty good a little bit more restricted than the than the stiff but you know it's still good it gets it gets a good hit but yeah I mean compared to this dizzy or anything like that I mean I first noticed it just based on price because this dizzy is just pretty pretty simple pretty basic you know with the light at the bottom same a same charge as this one but yeah I probably wouldn't buy this one I probably not gonna buy another cartridge of this one unless like I don't know I'm gonna buy a cartridge for my friend I mean a battery for my friends so like if they have that deal again I probably just buy a cartridge and just give my friend the battery but I mean I don't know I just it's just I probably won't buy this anymore I just probably just gonna keep on use buying these or the heavy hitters but I just lost my battery so I haven't been able to get a 5-10 thread on hydrogen water so I don't know but I believe you guys it's it's it's been fun but I'm taking last hit from both of these [ __ ] until this one blinks I don't know he's never gonna stop but [ __ ] go cheers everybody I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys keep tuning in like subscribe follow me on Instagram all that jazz but peace everybody Cheers [Music] Oh God Cheers [Music]", "X8NAKYjaUmI": "hi I'm Tim I wanted to talk about one of my favorite cartridges we have here at Saints this is the arrow pro cartridge it's kind of a little bit unique a little bit different from a lot of the other cartridges we have the first thing is that uses a different battery and it's really cool because it's magnetic so you just drop it in there and it just slides right in and stays really easy to switch them out if you have different cartridges indica and sativa for example I like this one here is jack hair it's a really energetic sativa I like it for when I have stuff to do I'm going about my day or cleaning the house it just gives you that energy to keep going the focus guys are great they're great price come check them out at Saints you", "KxUL7nH_1Hw": "our cartridges in they have very good air flow hits like a dad so if you want something that's a heavy hitter out of your pen something with big clouds good flavors it's our switch doctor for the natural therapies definitely one of the best ones on the market it comes with the cold pen is going to be magnet see so technology so it vibrates when it hits so that the oil moves through it evenly and snaps right back in there throw the screen real classy the package also comes with six different slots for all of your different cartridges and it's UV protective so if you're at the beach or at school or anything like that and you need something to protect your cartridges is definitely did I mention it hits like a dime my favorite one is gonna be to Jack Herer something good get me up and moving through the day we'll also got some different one folks a bubba kush Nightrider now that's Girl Scout cookies because that's our AeroPro come check it out exclusively here at new world",

be doing a second review of my arrow Pro which is a bit browser battery I found out today while going to a new dispensary and filling out the application form to be an eligible patient to qualify for getting medical cannabis delivered to me as also as well as I meant to say as well as buying it in store from nice people I'm not gonna give out names yet cuz I'm not them but they're good when I was there I was filling out that paperwork and I realized that people are allowed in Maryland to smoke inside of house or vaporize they are not allowed to smoke inside of houses that are owned by landlords but they're allowed to vaporize inside of houses that are owned by landlords so for those of you who are renters it's okay to vaporize and if you knew that awesome if you didn't know that now you know if you forgot it you remembered so this is the arrow Pro used to be called the Indigo Pro comes in this fancy case here it's sleek matte black it's got the arrow pro writing and logo writing on there with the little leaf that is the sprout of a cannabis flower plant and as you see it's very nice I'll show you two products that I use by them and I'll show you the battery itself and then we'll flip this camera around and get into the goods piece okay so this is kind of what a kit looks like it comes in cartridges which are distillates you can get indica which is the one that makes you more tired and lethargic you can get hybrid which is in the middle or sativa which is more uplifting and it's a distillate which is refined kind of thing for instance the distillate cartridge of Sumatran sunrise has a THC content of 80.5% or 400 two point five milligrams and those are the cbn content CBG CBC THC CBD and Delta eight THC percentages here's the hybrid sunset sherbert or one of them uh THC is 83.4% or 417 milligrams there's the percentages as well as milligram contents for the rest says it's a pure distillate oil full terpene profile and high potency and I got this at Zen leaf in Jessup and I got this one at remedy in Colombia it says it's a new name but same great product on both of these so it used to be called indigo Pro now it's arrow pro I like this one for the beta carry awfully level of 2.5 to the Delta limonene percentages of 1.48 and then I really like this one for the Delta limonene of 3 point 5 3 and the alpha-pinene of 4 point 0 9 so those are what the cartridges looks like they come in half half grams usually but here we'll get into this kit uh so again there's the logo it opens up I got my pushing cat in here from when I got a backpack anyways sorry about that burp here's a charging cable it comes with it you can charge it with your laptop PC charging block whatever you got car I wouldn't recommend smoking it on the go though but if you're in between the dispensary and going home and you want to charge it you could do that Eero vapor comm arrow pro users guide advanced vapor system tells you about charging it with the microUSB shows you the mouthpiece for the five point five milliliter cartridge the sleeve the device body the halo ring and the USB cord gives you warning labels about the arrow pro not to be used with other devices so this is a single kind of care kit so if you want to vape other distillate cartridges like a rhythm or a MPX or anything made by Gigli for verano it wouldn't be synonymous with it and we want to work with it tells you how to use it one pulse for that kind of stuff tells you about the pulses and halo flashes four batteries expiring or being working care and safety troubleshooting specifications 32 milliamp hours power output 8.5 watts charging current three hundred milli amp 1.5 watts length 97 millimeter with sleeve install diameter 14 millimeter weight 27 grams environmental and responsibility era pros committed to seeking out the best practices for the creation of our products to ensure the impact of the world it is a positive as if the impact our products have on the customers I'm sure I read that mistakenly anyways mine is a purple vaporizer battery this is what the cartridges look like in here this is magnetic so this will just open up and slide back in there without even having to push it in but you've seen the cartridges that's what they look like this one's just about gone this was the first one that I got with it and I really liked the alpha panning and limonene levels for my mild asthma and bronchodilation and breathing as well as the properties for limonene but I'm gonna flip this around and then we'll do a review of the Sumatran sunrise one more time because this video on YouTube got a lot of views so I'm doing another in-depth review with a hybrid as well as another Sumatran sunrise cartridge piece all right so I'm gonna do a review of this product now it kind of rumbles when you hit it it kind of vibrates and rumbles when you take an inhale so you know that you're getting some vapor production and it if it still haven't figured out exactly how the pulse thing works for telling you the battery percentages either being at a like thirty twenty or ten percent but I understand the halo ring flashing if I see any lights on this I know it's expired and basically I'm just gonna charge it in between so I'll do an inhale and show you the cloud production so so it's very good cloud production this particular strain the Sumatran sunrise which is a sativa tastes very piney because it has alpha pining at a level of about four percent three point eight to four percent and the limonene so it's like a Lyman but it's more piney in flavor aroma I don't know what it smells like in the air because I've got a fan blowing and I'm in a very open area in a basement of my parents abode so it's not really staying in one spot so I'm gonna like inhaling it or breathing it in with my nostrils to smell it it's just kind of moving and circulating throughout the air but I imagine it would smell like a pine needle or something piney I actually wanted to medicate that time instead of just showing you how much I could exhale where you still got the same effect it's good huh but if you actually inhale it and don't just blow it out um yeah so another thing that's great about this is if you buy multiple cartridges you can fit them there so you can take this cartridge out for instance and say put it right here and then you've got your battery which comes with this weird glass or plastic thing that slides in there to stop it from doing that I guess you want to do that when you're charging it so I know dust or particles get into the battery and it'll be charging without any gum getting in there or if you want to just carry it in your pocket you don't have any cartridge at the moment you know you can walk around with this anywhere you can even go through customs in an international airport they're probably not gonna hold you up it'll just be like what the hell is this and you can tell them it's a vape cartridge or a battery or something as long as there's no cannabis in there it should be okay that's what I think at least but anyways I'm not talking about that cuz I don't travel internationally that much it's been years but um yeah this is a good arrow Pro indigo Pro previously I don't recommend smoking it in public but I would recommend smoking it in your landlords house if you rent or your house that you live at or you know what you got so those were the two kits that I got today I mean the two cartridges carts those are the two carts that I got today for those of you who don't know what a cart is it's basically just a shorter version of cartridge and they're distillate cartridges which I will read you the information about if I had that card which I don't actively so I'm gonna do that later maybe I've done it in other videos anyways it's basically just pure distillate oil they use a very fine distillate process with I think some kind of alcohol or solvent or something instead of heat or pressure and so that would be the AeroPro distillate cartridges with the battery I got mine as a kit for $60 with the cartridge I think they're selling the batteries and the cartridges independently now so that's what they are peace out dude I like mine I still use it I found the terpene values to be greater than some of the butters or live resins even or regular shatters or crumbles or flowers obviously so that's what I would recommend to some cancer patients or people who have diabetes or just one of them Medicaid therapeutically for any of their other ailments and want to get a specific terpene at a higher percentage I'm sure they'd have a strain forward and I'm sure they'd have a cartridge for it if you want to get just that terpene percentage just go ask your local dispensary people to look at all of them they might not know the person individually because it's kind of a newer product what the percentages or milligram content levels are so just ask to look at all of them if they have time if it's not busy go on a day at a time when it won't be busy so you can learn a little bit about the product and see if you actually want to get it know where you're going in for and see what kind of terpenes you need and then look for what goes with that that's kind of what I did but anyways I'm gonna stop rambling and just say it's good I like it I still use it today I've had it for a couple weeks now and that was one of my liked videos one of my more viewed videos I didn't get any likes but I got a lot of views for it so I wanted to just come back and say I still like it and I still use it and I bought another cartridge or two today so anyways peace", "GkYcYx105WA": "hey guys is the app connection checking out the arrow Pro live flower series now just reviewing this stuff and it's awesome arrow Pro always strong what some people might not have liked about arrow pro before is the flavors so here's a skunk number one and this other blue and I forgot my box I don't know where it is but these are both part of the live flower series in the differences flesh flower terpenes full spectrum extraction you for contra or fact basically it's really good it's arrow Pro it's strong but it doesn't have that artificial flavoring that a lot of people don't like an arrow pros I particularly liked the Mountain mist some of the berry ones I wasn't that big a fan of flavor but if it's strong I still like it and some of their I liked all their citrus type flavors were great but if you want the arrow pro strength and you really just want straight flower tasting these are awesome and I got to say these taste great I probably would pick this over a lot of the flavors and I would still get some flavors here and there but for someone that doesn't want any flavors and just I mean this artificial flavors just once like that real flower flavor this is great and this one was a skunk number one Kate and it came in at 86% you know arrow pro is basically C so hard we're in a different package magnetic and hits a little harder and really performed well this other one I lost my packaging but I liked it as well same strength that you expect the narrow cartridges the other thing is you might want to check out our live resin review if you really like live resin more than distill it arrow pros live resident substantially stronger than any of the other live resins I've tried and maybe it's a bit of the hitting system maybe it's the way they make it but I found air opposed live resin to be stronger than raw garden it was stronger than Pinsk it was stronger than remedies it was stronger than I could think of bloom farms those are the live resins I tried recently and it was substantially stronger than all of those so shout out to the live resin but back onto the flower series this is a distill it with better tasting stuff and I gotta say overall really great quality product so let's take a hit of the skunk and they'll take here this other one don't talk a little about the flavor defects all right yeah it just tastes like tastes like weed just straight like weed and even like more so than other carts that have tried to make the weed taste this really tastes almost like you're breathing in like when you open a bag of fresh weed actually smells like when you open a bag of remedy we died I like the taste very similar the heir to one of the flowers that I have theirs let's take a look at the oil too on this one getting towards the end all right that's it the other one now all right this one also just taste straight like flour actually reminds me of one of these those rubber circle pre-rolls that I had he's very similar this let's take a look at that of oil yeah I like these I would say on average I would pick a life a live flower series over a regular flavor AeroPro even though there's some flavors I still like I really like this life are they really got the flavor on this way more like weed even than other cards sort of like tried to get that weed tastes 100% on point AeroPro one of the best brands out there you can get in multiple states thanks for watching guys they had questions or comments about it please post below this definition have a great week", "er1VFCYGszI": "what it is what he do I am D welcome to the first episode of we enjoy every day the [ __ ] podcast where we just talk about reviews well I

the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're gonna be checking out the sugar plum sativa co2 extracted oil by harmony farms in an indigo Pro cartridge no I don't really mess with pens a whole lot but I've been diggin this indigo pro pen quite a bit to the point where we've been doing you know we've been buying these quite a lot a little bit more than I would have expected to be honest with you but with all that it just tells you this is a really good product I'm really picky when it comes to pens just because I like nice big hits I like to feel like I'm taking a DAB and most pens just don't do that there with oh I'm gonna shut up before you guys think I'm advertising for these people but anyway with all that let's hop right into the numbers so this is it says HF co2 sativa sugar plum so I'm not sure what this means the HF means co2 means that this is processed through a different format than regular distillate so since this is co2 there is no technically there isn't a solvent outside of the water that it's used but it this is processed a whole different way but it dis still come out in a liquid kind of form that is able to be used in some of these products the one thing I will mention so I've tried three products this will be my fourth and the first one had the flavors spot-on really really good one of the best tasting things I've ever had but the last two haven't really had a whole lot of flavor so I've been kind of disappointed on the flavor side the high is still really really good but we're gonna see how this one turns out I'm excited to keep on doing these reviews though excuse me I really do enjoy this product and with that I'll hop in front of the camera here in a couple of days and let you guys know how the flavor is and the hi hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried the sugar plum indigo Pro now this is the sativa one as you can tell we've used this a little bit less than the other one just by a little though as far as the flavor is concerned now this one does have a real nice kind of like cannabis flavor as you guys know I really enjoy these pens and let me hit it real quick so on the inhale you do get a slight kind of sweetness but as soon as you exhale you just get this is kind of like your mouth gets overwhelmed with a cannabis flavor and it's not like a nasty gross kind of like skunky weed it's just like a pretty kind of like that piney the pining cannabis scent there we go as far as the highest concern sorry that does give you a little bit of a cough if you take a big rip as far as the highest concern this is more of an upper something that's gonna like wake you up you're a little bit more energetic I was actually just smoking an indica and was kind of like and as you guys can see I'm a little bit more perked up it does give you like a boost that you do feel right away and it does give you kind of a boost in the eyes the eyes this is my eyes apparently in the eyes I was feeling kind of like heavy eyes just a second ago from the end the indica indigo pro pen but now that I smoked this I'm a little bit more awake and the eye thing is completely gone which is kind of trippy to be honest with you with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "F-AQH5p9zVg": "hey guys does daffy connection we're checking out the jack herer arrow pro cartridge now this thing tested in the 80s I think mid to high 80s I don't have the exact results down below and I gotta say this was a very high energetic cartridge finished this one kind of quick because I hit it quite a bit the oil burned vaped I guess you could say not so quick and it lasted quite a bit the mystical melody was another one I reviewed I really liked that oil but it did seem to vape a lot faster this is a pretty slow comparatively and the effects is pretty energetic it's be a good pre-workout cartridge you know if you're trying not to be all tired this is a great one for that I'll take a hit of it so you can see how it is but it's really no different on hitting then all the other arrow pro cartridges they all hit really good yes I'm getting towards the end so efficiency overall as always good an arrow pro know a lot of them say a seesaw right there there's really just seesaw hardware and a different kind of form factor so arrow Pro Jack rare two thumbs up great cartridge everything about it is great so thanks for watching guys as dad prediction and have a great week", "yWaI_-5tZNg": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 where we give you the most in-depth reviews as efficiently as possible and today we're checking out another indigo Pro cartridge this is another indica mix it's called the Knight Rider and it's their sugar plum flavor and with that we're gonna hop right into the numbers so as you guys know THC comes an eighty six point three four and that's about it harmony Farms is the company who provided the starting material for this and that's about it there's not a whole lot to mention because this is a cartridge I can sit here and talk about smelling it and all that stuff but what I will do is I will go and try this on camera here in a second and kind of go over the flavor and then I will have tried it by then a couple of days in a row so I'll be able to give you guys a full kind of like high also so anyway with all of that as you guys see these cartridges are pretty cool they are magnetic I wish I would have grabbed the pen so I could show it but with all that I'm really excited to go try this and I will be back again with you guys here soon and we'll talk about the flavor and of the function hey guys what's up so I went ahead and tried that Knight Rider or I'm gonna go ahead and try the Knight well let me word it this way we've been trying the Knight Rider as you can tell by this ghost of a cartridge but the way I do reviews is I like to taste it in for the camera so you guys get a feel for it once again I do like these indigo Pro peds because they are magnetic if you're somebody who's older and struggles with like screwing stuff this stuff is perfect like you're set and then there's no buttons to push nothing to figure out so anyway as far as the flavor is concerned it has a nice sweetness on the inhale on the exhale like you do get a little bit of like this kind of like plumb sort of flavor to it it's not very heavy which I wish it was a little bit more plummy but it does have that really good sweetness and it does kind of linger there's kind of like a pepperiness building also um so not not a bad flavor all around actually pretty good the high itself is actually really stony I'm smoking on this a little bit trying to write down the flavor and I'm really stoned right now I'm trying to pull it together and I know you can't tell but I feel it really heavy behind a really heavy really heavy behind the eyes and obviously my speech is a little slurred so yeah this is really also kind of euphoric happy giggly honestly I can tell you guys a joke right now and I'd make myself laugh so with all that if you guys enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow Paige this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "u8nj8ZwnTkk": "welcome to the state Auto Body air pro Diagnostics video in this video we'll be discussing the two types of scanning that we can do with this tool the first being the remote assisted scan the second being the Giotto powered self scan the first step in getting started is to make sure that the tablet is turned on has adequate battery life and is connected to Wi-Fi to log into the Wi-Fi tap the icon in the bottom right corner of the tablet screen select safe secure enter your sate student or employee number and your sate password to login on the vehicle you'll need to connect the dlc connector from the tool to the vehicle this will be connected to the dlc port which stands for data link connector this is usually located under the drivers steering column in the kick panel area it's also known as the obd2 port and of course obd stands for on-board diagnostics with the dlc connector connected to the vehicle we can now take the tablet and log in on the login screen by selecting self skin the next step is to make sure that the vehicle's battery has adequate charge you may need to install a battery tender to ensure voltage stays adequate during the scan process now you can ensure that the vehicle is koe o which stands for key on engine off on a vehicle with push-button start with your foot off the brake pedal you may need to push the start button once or twice to activate this mode on the tablet select the Orion button which will open an internet browser this is the repaired dashboard it will show all the vehicles currently in the system hit add repair to add a new vehicle and select VIN number in the bottom right corner of the tablet hips the keyboard icon to bring up a keyboard in the bottom left you'll see a number tab to bring up a number pad you you can enter the VIN number with I'm entering all ones just as a demo vehicle for the purpose of this video once you enter the VIN number it will decode the VIN and give the info for the vehicle here I'm selecting the shop which is safe and then an insurance company now for the school's purposes there's no insurance works so it's all customer pay so select customer pay by scrolling down or entering the letter C and start typing in customer pay and it will pop up on the screen underneath that we will have other selections to make for this job for example we can enter a ro number so we'll enter a PHA Kartal number for this then we'll proceed to enter some more information so here I'm entering in the mileage of the vehicle and then I'm selecting some more information for example are the airbags deployed what is the visual deployment of the airbag for example I'm gonna write down that maybe the driver's airbag is deployed or maybe it's the only one deployed next I can select some other information is the vehicle drivable as mentioned where was the vehicle hit and then I'm gonna hit create in the bottom corner this is the screen that will next pop up for requesting the assisted scan in the top selected type of scan you're trying to do for example a pre scan underneath that the inspection type stays the same the inspection scan and the device stays the same underneath that you have boxes you can select to indicate which warning lights you are seeing on on the dash underneath that you can write other warning information that may be pertinent to whoever's diagnosing the vehicle remotely now what I'm going to do is enter damage description in this box so I'm writing in here that it's hits front Center and there's an area in the box below it or in this box you can write any other pertinent information to the person who's going to diagnose your scan for example I'm gonna write in here that the bumper and headlight are removed since removing those on their own could cause a code to pop up that may not actually be a problem if there's other damage for example broken wiring harness things of that nature please put that information in here underneath that in the contact area you can select my name since I'm in the system already or you can put in your own name so first name and last name as well as a contact phone number by putting your phone number in this will allow the person doing the remote diagnostics to contact you directly on say your cell phone so you can be at the vehicle with your cell phone in case they need to contact you during that process hit submit you'll be back to this screen next and the request scan icon will change color after that request scan you will get an email with all the information however coming back to this repair dashboard there's a lot of really good information that one fine here after the scan if you want to see the report other than in the email select this green button for scan reports this vehicles had both the assisted scan and a self scan so the assistance scan comes up as the inspection scan report will click on this and then the lower left-hand side of the screen you'll see that it's loading once it's loaded click on it and here's the scan just as we will have emailed to ourselves so in here it gives us all the information that the technician noted from the scan it'll give off any codes I will tell us what each control module in the vehicle was showing with it was good or bad where there are codes it will give you recommendations on how to potentially repair the problem that is detected and it's a good bit of information for record-keeping for yourself for the customer and in the case of insurance work just submit to the insurance company underneath that same tab we can go back click that same icon again and now we'll go to the results of the self scan and same thing we'll notice the loading section in the bottom corner of the screen once loaded click on it it will open up a new tab and so very similar results from the self scan and this will be emailed to yourself as well same information as before however because it's a self scan we won't get any recommendations back from anyone on how to potentially address these repairs the orange icon will allow you to edit incorrect information or enter missing information the red icon on the right will be used for billing purposes at the end of the repair that concludes the basic operation of the assisted scan please note that the assisted scan can also allow programming of any body modules it can allow setup and adjustment of any ADIS system components however any use of this assisted system does cost money per use so please be aware of that and we'll have to build the customer accordingly now let's get into these self scan mode the nice thing with the self scan mode is no fee for us to use this however we also lose some of the capabilities of the assisted scan system but we also have the ability now to take control of some of these systems into our own hands to enter the self scan mode select the giotto icon on the tablet and wait for the program to load once the program is loaded we will enter the vehicle's information by selecting the manufacturer in this case Chevrolet and then select the get bin number it will get the VIN number from the vehicles PCM through the DLC connector and it should decode all the info for the vehicle hit enhance powertrain this will ensure that we get all the correct or wium information rather than just generic information to scan from wait for this to load and then we will select which modules we'd like to scan once this is loaded we're going to select all modules for the purpose of our collision repair so that's the all button and then this is gonna scan all the modules in the system if you haven't looked at the screen where my finger was pointing there it's showing out of 37 so that's telling us that this vehicle has 37 control modules within it every one of these 37 control modules can produce their own diagnostic trouble codes some of these modules are quite small modules that may control only a very specific section of the vehicle however it's very important that we check all of these a conventional scan tool may only be able to scan three modules for example the PCM the ABS system and then the airbag system so that leaves a lot of modules that may not be able to be detected and scanned with conventional tool knowing that many of these modules may not throw a light on the dash makes it very concerning that some of this down or some of these problems may not be able to be detected without a proper system such as this I fast forwarded through the loading since it can take while for all the modules to respond this is the home screen and if you look in the top right you'll see the engine light this will tell us if the engine light is on and allow us to reset the engine light before going and erasing any codes research the code and the potential problem that could cause it and correct it on the Left we have a listing of all 37 modules and the state they're in and in this case there's no problems if there were codes it would say that there's a code or a problem in that particular module I've now selected live data where I can select up to eight different functions to read live while the vehicle is running in this case I'm just selecting some random functions that will give me readings as to what's going on currently this next screen is showing you the same functions but now in a graph form again while the vehicle is running this next section is called system tests it's an area where we can test certain systems or programs certain systems or modules this is limited on what this software is capable of however if there's something we are unable to do from here in the assisted mode we are able to have everything programmed remotely the onboard test results screen gives us a basic summary of some of the functions of the vehicle this concludes the basic functions of the assisted scan and self scan with the air pro diagnostic tool if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask otherwise air pro Diagnostics offers excellent service and support for their equipment thank you", "iJzONqaP0fg": "hey guys it's Deb connection we're reviewing the juice Co cartridge specifically the Clementine babe cartridge you know overall juice it's pretty good you know the the quality the oil you can tell is good the flavor is good the effect is a pretty energetic effect the thing I just got to say is it could be stronger and you know this came in at seventy seven percent THC I know THC percent is not everything you know I had an arrow Pro that was in the 70s and that seemed a lot stronger than this and not everyone is looking for the strongest cartridge some people want something that's not gonna totally knock you out and this is it is not gonna knock you out and it's just it's just not super strong but other than that it's you know it's a really good quality cartridge and they're using good quality hardware and juice Cove is something I definitely would try again so it's not something I just say I'll screw this brand they're using crap hardware and the oil sucks there's no point trying this and there's a unless as a drastic change no this is all they needs it to be a little bit stronger a little bit stronger and this is an awesome cartridge and it'd be a contender to be probably one of the best ones so you know that just it takes more hits to get into effect and even when you take the more hits it's just not the same effect that I'm getting alright right now if like roots cartridges or select or arrow Pro but it's almost there and I really hope to be updating this in a month or so I'm getting a new juice cartridge that's way better but at the time this was even the strongest one they had at essence so let's drop in we'll take a hit and you guys can see what it hits like have you seen a seesaw hits really nothing that I knew but anyway for now I have to give AeroPro one thumb up for just the quality of hardware's good oil quality you can tell is good but I gotta get one thumb down just for strength because it could be stronger overall though definitely something I'm trying again and hopefully be updating this review in the next month or so thanks for watching guys this dab connection reporting from the corner of a hotel room have a great week", "2d3cqW0Chxg": "hi I'm Tim this is the era Pro Koch's this is our newest cartridge that we picked up I really have been liking them a lot lately they have their own battery so if you do have a different battery you got to get the battery or the nice thing is will better price than the others and then they hit really well when you do take a hit it vibrates which is kind of different it's kind of nice and this one is the mystical melody raspberry lime and tangerine it tastes really good so that one's my favorite come check them out", "CQnJPYQZ9Qs": "hello it's Chris welcome back to good babe reviews I have another review because I do yeah today I got ripped the label off but this is riff raff by Indigo vapors I rip the label off because it is in my way and as you can see it looks like Mountain Dew I looked on the website is a pair like a pair you know like the fruit the pair it's that pretty much pear flavored so yeah oh I also got this thing it's a drip tip which I got on a joy tag atomizer this thing it's so cool it's a glass that doughnut shape Hindu so yeah it's really cool it's from sage wood glass and I know it's all backwards but whatever sage wood glass and it's got all their stuff on the back but you can't really read that well I'm just gonna read off the back hand-blown glass except hand-blown glass art accessories for electronic cigarettes slash personal vaporizers so they make glass drip tips that's what they do and all their stuff is very unique one-of-a-kind stuff someone should buy something from there it's it's gone you can't buy it anymore so this one it's you can't buy that it's it's it's gone gone forever so yeah sorry my bad on that and my fan is on which is not good for review making cuz you know in order for me to see the vapor that comes out that airflow just sucks so [ __ ] and I'm gonna get up and turn it off god oh now I wait for it to turn all the way off yeah I've been really liking this drip tip though it's uh it's probably one of the best methods I tried some because it's a direct method you just drop it right into the atomizer and there it goes so you don't have to worry about you know wicks being saturated or anything nothing like that it just it's in there it's good and only drawback is since you only put in like two or three drops it runs out really quickly and you know when it does because we've all experienced the out of liquid taste not very pleasant not a good not a good taste to have I made sure I topped this off before I started to review just to avoid such unpleasantries so alright that's turning off so yeah let's do it Wow really big throat hit for being a fruit flavor generally the fruit flavors I've been getting have pretty big throat hits but it's definitely a good one this one really it took me by surprise a little bit definitely a good thing especially since this is my first after-dinner vape so it really has to try hard to impress me right now it's after dinner y'all know how important that is both my nostrils are working today good stuff but oh my god this is a really good is a great pear flavor it's not like candied at all it tastes just like a bite of fresh pear I could taste I can even taste the skin of the parrot even I could pick that up in here this is just is a really good flavor for a pear who's again riffraff by indigo and I'm actually gonna check back on their website and see if it said anything else like any other additional flavors pretty nice vapor coming out of there so really good output come on there that's slow yes uh-huh it says on the website riffraff a nice tart pear flavor coupled with honey and of course just an extra touch to bring them together it's a fantastic fruit flavor and not to be missed I agree I agree with that statement wholeheartedly this is definitely a very good one I'm glad they sent this to me as a free sample cuz I don't know the idea of a pear and a honey thing it doesn't sound like it would be that good I mean it does but not enough that I would jump up and just buy it but uh anytime you buy something from indigo they send you a little three milliliter twelve milligram nicotine little little sample bottle just like this little teeny tiny thing with a drip tip you could really extend the life of that which is really good nice thick paper I'm loving it especially after the string of thin ones I've been getting whatever is what it is this is a good one though yeah I really enjoy this I'm really enjoying the drip tip as well nice glass feels good as good as one of a kind so yeah so if I were you I'd head over to Sage wood glass dot-com again sage would say to a glass there's my nasty cut-up finger say yeah sage would say good stuff adding new stuff all the time I was looking for glass drip tips like this and I was about to give up its guy couldn't find anything that really grabbed me and all the stuff that did I ended up really liking ended up being sold out and it was all one-of-a-kind stuff so it was gone it was gone forever but for some reason some websites like to keep it on there just to [ __ ] with you so anyways something brought me back to sage wood it was really like 15 minutes and they added like a whole new page of stuff and then it became a matter of now I can't decide which one I want and I picked this one so again you can see nice like blue blue like frosty stuff and when you hold it up to light I can't really do that here you can see like greens and yellows and stuff in there really cool really awesome I'm really liking the drip tip method the atomizer is a Joyetech atomizer I believe one point five ohms resistance excellent excellent excellent Oh one thing one little teeny tiny drawback about using the atomizer since it's just an atomizer it does tend to get a little bit hot when you use it because obviously it's just the atomizer it's the heating element this is just that's it so the outside does tend to get a little hot associate when you're using it really heavy and you're not ready for it you can touch it burns just a little bit not enough to like leave a burn or anything but it's wake you up this is a good one huh well since I can't really do anything more about Babylon about crap I'm just gonna wrap this up with the with the ratings so first things first vapor production nice and thick could be a little bit thicker or yes I tend to like more on thicker vegetable glycerin dominant liquids you're not dominant but more of it so paper on this I'd give it about an eighth it's really cool it gets thick you know that nice you know thicknesses like darker spots I love them I like it real pillowy and thick when it comes out of your mouth hole so that gets it's a neat throat hit the hit on this also gets an 8 you know pretty uh it's good especially for a 12 milligram naked team this is less than what I normally get so I assume with a my normal one it'd be pretty much right level with what I like so definitely good on that but it's a 12 so I really don't know so that gets an 8 simply just for what it is and flavor excellent excellent flavor I'd have to give it a 9 uh yeah because is a really good pair really good you could taste the peel you can taste the inner organs of it the honey comes through for a little added sweetness and a little something extra maybe an orange I don't know it says in the website a little something extra I read it before so you know but uh could be an orange could be like a citrusy everything really interesting really good I might end up buying this again at some point who knows really good overall it gets an eight and a half out of ten this is again riff-raff by indigo vapor vapors vapor vapors just vapor indigo vapor I will link it all down below I'll link the product I'll link

arrow pro cartridge Sumatran sunrise now this is sativa comes in the 80s and it's great it tastes great tastes kinda like a tequila sunrise it's very similar flavor to that but with with no alcohol tastes like it's just the sweet part of it and the effects are good you know it's an energetic sativa there is no energy loss with this pretty much gives you a good amount energy when you hit it and you know uses all the same arrow Pro hardware arrow Pro some people don't know is actually made by C self you can tell the similarity when you look at it it's just a different bottom but it's a Cecil hardware and overall yeah I give this cartridge two thumbs up and be honest with you have never had a better Oppo characters all the arrow Pro cartridges have been excellent so far and this one particularly is from Nevada essence Tropicana West is where I got this one and I'll take a hit of it so you guys see what looks like yep it's good the AeroPro battery another tip on the arrow pro battery you know I've heard people complain oh there's $35 for this battery but what you can do to get a cheaper is a lot of dispensaries carry it without the case and if you get it without the count the case is only 15 bucks so if you didn't get an error for a battery say hey you guys got the one without the case and then it's only 15 bucks so two thumbs up for pro great effects great taste great

pretender for the day and today we're gonna be talking about vape pens simply basically we're gonna hit up on our French harmony which I've glasses some about the best product into their cartridge Thank You harmony but also too so you understand the setup the basic part would be the battery being the top part either button or just pull but we prefer the button it will come with a charger for it USB always that'll be the basic setup for that but cartridges here so we are having this laser beam green crack and the Gupta these are some of my favorite notch because of the product but the case itself is nice you get a nice good clear glass that you can see through but also at the top basically we have this kind of carb cap that you can open up to allow more oxygen to come in so you get bigger rips they won't bring your oil a little faster but two or three good big rips will get you where you need to be but come check us out don't just trust me you", "pM-PNSq537Q": "what's up what's up family and friends it's your boy Frank ESCO once again I know it's been some time since I got in contact with y'all had a situation pop up once again at work this time I wasn't able to fix it at the job I actually had to come home and fix it pretty much what it was is every time I try to vape out of my little cartridge right here this just light would blink and it also happened to another one of my cartridges like this and this baby was brand new I was I was going crazy I've paid some good money for these cartridges so pretty much it was blinking it wasn't hitting I wasn't getting a pull from it nothing nothing nothing from this thing so pretty much what I figured out was all these things are just positive and negative heat coils going through that's all it is all these little vaporizers that's all they are so when it started blinking like that I was wondering if the wire from the inside was making contact with a negative or if the wire on the inside snapped let me try to show you what I mean all right so this is actually in the bottom of this one see if I could get this off with one hand and also at the bottom of this one you will have this little pin with the washer and a wire tucked in between it well if hopefully y'all guys can see that but my wire was snapped completely snapped off so what I did was I grabbed an old cartridge pulled off the rubber and ripped out as much wire as I could what I did after that was I took that wire with my tweezers wrapped it around the tweezers about twice to make kind of like a a ball of wire with a lead coming out of it I stuck the ball of wire directly down in there stuck the lead back through or straight up put the rubber piece around it because that's not supposed to make contact with anything on the inside if you understand that it's only supposed to make contact with the positive little pin or nipple whatever you guys want to call this thing so the wire goes in between the rubber and the metal once you get that going on the inside just make sure that there's a wire going across sometimes you got lucky if not the ball will hit the wrapping coils because all it is it's just a wire snapped so you're just making another connection with that wire so that it connects what you're positive you're negative everything's good you're able to hit and a vape again hopefully this helps some of you guys out I didn't really see an explanation like this out there but I'm able to hit my vape able to hit this bad boy yeah", "MILvrSbKOHU": "hey everybody you know what I thought about something after I wrote that big pen story and about how kids get their hands or debate pens I thought boy why don't I just show my vape pens to sort of make an example of I'm just gonna kick me goodbye with now I have one vape pen that is actually under charging and it's called a volcano and it looks just like a ballpoint pen that you actually can put marijuana concentrate in their live resin sugar shatter all that an incredibly powerful stuff and when I show you this thing and it's on the charger and I'll come back on when it's charged and demonstrate it looks just like a ballpoint pen this babe pen is called an arrow propane and you can sort of tell you know it's not like the ballpoint pen but this thing is odorless there's there's no smoke vein you're not ever gonna know I'm around there's no smell at all this is kind of top of the line right now it took the cannabis Bay Packers to skillet so that's made of co2 the concentrate I keep thinking it out via co2 is the process much cleaner and it's just poof darn it's delicious and that's taste it's not harsh all the candidates we would try it are like wow but anyway so this is the Aero chrome and you can see how easily it is now too steep in this is delivering 90% this is losery most people are not like me they could not take the 90% th the Blue Dream arrow klompen I just walk around town it's incredible as simple as that out comes the blue tree

ever great", "yVzLYyL7GwI": "another mastermind here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right as promised i am back surprise i'm actually in my normal spot uh i hope the sound is not too bad but here it is the grow ohio uh butterfly effect i got it upside down sorry row ohio butterfly effect uh vape pods i have not opened it waiting waiting to do this video with you guys so i could try it live give my live this is a live review so first things first let's go over the numbers it's kind of hard to see here um it says here um this is obviously a grow ohio product total tac is 574 milligrams of thc there is again this is extremely hard to see 142 milligrams of cbd in this so that's that's a nice thing um we all we all like cbd um this is supposed to be uh layer cake is the strain that they're used for this product grow how your label is extremely hard to read even with my glasses on the extraction process for you guys that are wondering this is a co2 extracted product so here's a close-up of the box um what else can i tell you without squinting my eyes um it says oil vaporization it doesn't really say layer cake on this part but then it's labeled as layer cake pod kit pod kit lyric cake so i'm a big fan of layer cake and it actually has lc on the back i guess that's for lyric cake i don't know if you can see that or not it's probably hard to see you can see the print is extremely small so that is my feedback initially is that the print is really small um packaging wise it's a nice little box it's different than any of the other ones i've seen i'm going to go ahead and open it see what i got inside so i'm going to go ahead and break the seal on it which you got i don't even know how to do that i'm going to learn it just like real time i'm just going to try to turn it to see if that's what happens it looks like one you just twist off so here we go no that did not work so first thing i don't i don't know how to open this i don't want to damage the the packaging for documenting purposes so i cracked the seal off um so now we're live guys i i haven't quite figured this out uh okay i got this guys it's a push in so push in and turn see you did that see that it's a pushing and turn maybe not yeah there we go it's opened um i would say we need some girl ohio should include instructions on how to open this on the label i mean on the box there should be some arrows to tell the person which way to turn this this has a a unique locking mechanism in it the pod is inside of here okay so here is the here's the product i believe the cartridge is already inserted in here so let me take this out so we get a look at it here is the actual layer cake pod so you guys can see the oil no not 420 live this is a live review of the lyric cake pod by grow ohio i got my glasses on hey carlson hey what's up so we're doing a live review and this is similar to the aeropro um something else is in here hold up let me see ah you do receive a charging cable i was wondering i was like well i mean my aeropro came with a charging cable so you do get a charging cable and it's definitely different there appears to be no kind of cover for the mouthpiece i think you just i think it's just ready to go so i'm just gonna i'm gonna try it and see if it's ready to go and here we go we'll find out if it's layered cake or not because i i consider myself an expert on layer cake because i bought lots of layer cake so here we go this again is a layer cake by grow ohio in a co2 extracted pod and this is powered by c cells what it says here we go well heck that worked i didn't expect it to work that easily [Music] hmm whoa first reactions does it taste like layer cake strain i'm gonna say yes it does i am tasting the same terpenes that i taste when i buy the layered cake flour which i don't have in front of me we have some here so i've used it as recently as today so i should know that even if it was different um as far as the the way the oil tastes going in um i feel like it's a smooth let me try this again bigger tug this time okay so yeah and if you pull too hard it will bite you is if i hit it a little bit harder i probably would be in the choke zone or bite i got the bite zone bite when it's biting your coughing your brains out but um you know for me um if you hit it just the right you want to take a big hit take a nice small hit kind of like you would do if you were hitting the packs i would say when i compare this to the arrow pro i would say the airflow to me appears to be better on this pod i just this is this is just my first impression right now yeah the tickle on your throw you're exactly right gamer 247 that's exactly what it is the tickle i like that to tickle it in your throat now here's here's one downside i'm finding already i can't make my adapter work on this i'd have to i'd have well well i don't know guys i'm i'm i'm always trying a new experiment can it happen yes it can happen with the bone [Music] there's a tickle the tickling in my throat guys yeah if you've got the adapter i've been showing you guys all you have to do is just touch it up against the mouthpiece and pull and you will get a nice smooth dose i just want to go back over the dosing they had this on here uh seven point god this print is really bad grow ohio 7.87 um so i think i like this um the price was 72 dollars at the botanist in columbus um a few other shops have gotten this today it's just this is a brand new product it just came out just hit the market they've been talking about it um and uh it was 57 with the indigent discount for those that have engine or veteran discount botanist does 25 percent off um hey i'm starting to feel the effects of this i'm going to hit it again but i i can tell you now something else i'm noticing guys the oil moves a lot more lucid than some of the other concentrate pins i've had that oil is definitely moving around in there and that's interesting so this oil definitely has a different viscosity beside it's not as thick as say the cure ohio oil which i can hold upside down here and it's not moving this stuff when i turn this it's moving so and and then like i said this is a co2 extraction i'm not 100 sure on cure ohio so i won't say what their extraction was on this i'd have to go back to the container and look what it says but this my whole thing is i've been looking for an affordable co2 extracted vape i've been wanting to do the clutch calex peak one but they're still kind of expensive oh by the way um they said it's just almost a gram but not a gram so the net weight is 0.92 grams so we're we're 0.8 away from the whole gram they should have just ma grow how make it the whole gram you'll sell a lot more of them with the one gram on there i just know you can do it even if you have to add a little bit more cbd to it just to get it like a five maybe a 550 and then add the rest cbd to get that one gram this just do that for me one gram layer cake carts when you would be the only one that has this so what i like no buttons um i can't speak on battery life yet so i have to tell you guys on 420 live after we do a couple videos what it's like um cost wise um i see that the refills are 60 for half a gram um that's still a little bit pricey for me grow ohio and llc owners dispensary owners but i'm not going to say it's insane um but i think the price could be maybe down to 50 for the half gram 55 with tax will probably be a better price point and we can get there i think with energy status you end up paying that anyway but i think for all patients we should kind of get to a level price on it i think they'll sell faster if you've got a whole gram for you get all if you get a whole gram for 60. man that's not a that's not bad if it's co2 extracted and they're using they're using good terpenes and they're using c and it has cbd in it too man i'm telling you guys this makes sense especially if you really like layer cake like i really have had success with lyric cake my girlfriend is a successful layer cake it doesn't matter whether grow ohio or not i'm just saying that that strain itself and the terpene profile that it presents has been successful for us hey robert what's up buddy yeah i mean one day i think we'll get to the to the half gram for 25 35 i think that's that thing that's coming soon i mean i've already seen the one origin uh coming down a little bit on their price on their half grams so they're in the 40s now so we're getting closer um i think as more processors come online and there are more coming way more than you guys could even imagine i just can't wait to tell you about them because i already know about them i'm just saying you can go on the internet matter of fact i downloaded the list of all the licensed operations so we can have them for our board um so i've i've got some information that we're going to have together you know for the advisory board so we can know more about these llc's start understanding more about how they operate and who they operating with so we can kind of work with them too to kind of help get stuff changed make stuff better oh you should just clean the garage see man you you're a soldier man because it's hotter than hot out there right now man i just the transition from my car into the house with no air i mean it's not it's not too hot here because we have portable ac units going but we have fans on and it's just you know i like to be comfortable in my environment and you know i might want to take guys to the flower room upstairs and it's 90 degrees in there right now so i can't go t we can't go in the flower room and film in the flower room because it's too hot in the flower room right now and so my whole thing is i definitely want to try a different strain just for comparisons but when i look at vape cartridges what i know about them how i feel about them i would say this is very similar to what michigan has with their claw pods um the similar technology the battery feels really nice in my hand but i am concerned i might drop it and i don't know the durability of it i feel like the aeropro is built very well to protect the pod my concern with this here is that the the pod is exposed grow ohio if you're listening the pod is exposed the reason i'm concerned about this is that a person like me with my brain injury i knock things over i drop things and sometimes i might throw things so i need something that has durability and so my concern is that this tank if it's knocked over it's sitting here on my table like this and boom it hits my tablet or hits this hard wood here it's shattered so when i have a product like this guys and it's very fragile what i do is um i take one of these containers you know and i set it in there like so so that it may lean from left to right but it's not going to fall over and that's how i keep my stuff from breaking something else i have going on too is this is the way i've decided to recycle my rosin containers i'm using this this if you see all those uh fire lines and everybody else uh containers in here and i basically use this to hold my pin so my pin won't fall over and then i also use this other one that i have here for my vape cartridges so they i use the empty rosin containers to help hold up and keep the vape cartridges from falling over it's straight ingenuity and engineering macgyver tactics as i call it oh yeah yeah you're right i you know i yeah they might think i'm talking about something in the program or something flower room so yeah the just the flavor that we already everybody watching my channel knows the flower room is my girlfriend's room with all the exotic uh succulents and things like that in it because my girlfriend does uh unique she does she's into growing unique flowers um not not cannabis flowers so um just that's the disclaimer for whoever might be watching we're not talking about that kind of flower room we're talking about regular plants like money trees and uh spider plants uh things of that nature so it um you know we're also doing something we're doing this experiment with a candenella plant which is very interesting we bought them at lowe's and it's the same thing you use to get for bug spray what we're trying to do is see if we can grow the plant and we can clone that plant and maybe we can help people make their own bug repellent they would just be all natural no chemicals because it would just be the oil coming from the plant so you know it's a natural occurring thing we're just trying to grow some of those as an experiment but we also grow cucumbers tomatoes", "LCFYu-EowJI": "check out that cartridges all the other colleges are raping the mouth it's a type of cartridge that when

most liked and viewed well most popular videos at least on on YouTube so what I'm gonna do is a another installment of the arrow pro series I've actually got three more distillate cartridges coming to me by delivery probably on Friday because it snowed today from zen leaf in Jessup Maryland so I'll be doing reviews on those eventually but right now the one that I'm going to be doing a review on is sunset sherbert now I've got a water-pipe bong here but in Maryland it's only legal to vape inside of rented apartments by landlords or from landlords as a renter I live with my family so it's okay for me to smoke in here but that technically this might still be considered vaping I'm not sure because it's vaporizing instead of burning a plant material anyways back to the arrow Pro this is sunset sherbert it's a hybrid sorry I ripped the packaging a little bit but there's what it looks like I'll read you the back warning this product contains THC the contents will be lawfully consumed only by

it's a disposable cartridge which means that it's recyclable the terpene total percentage is nine point two zero percent well I like this one it's got beta-carotene of two point five two percent it's also got Finchel which I rarely ever get at one point one zero percent and campign which I barely ever get at 0.22% it also has carry off the lean dioxide to zero point two five percent and now for human lean at 0.72% and I post all push the photos in the beginning of this to show you the rest of the terpene profiles for that one I'm gonna flip this around and we'll look at the package a little bit more the setup with the battery and everything how it goes and then yeah we'll get into it peace H this is my system this is my package here with the arrow Pro distillate cartridge 0.5 milliliters point zero one seven fluid ounces net net weight here's the battery once again AeroPro I've got the indigo battery the purple one it also comes in a graphite grey one and it's got this clear plastic sleeve that you can keep in it when you're charging it or you have it in the case comes with this charging case I've got a pusheen cat in here comes with the user's guide which I'm not gonna read again because I've done it before and then I've got some receipts and stuff like that for keeping everything together with my pack and my kit what we're gonna do is we'll take this is just like cartridge out of the container so this is what it looks like that's way 2.5 milliliters or point zero one seven fluid ounces looks like this is a hybrid strain so it's in the middle it says L two three eight on it I don't know what that means just yet and then it's got this nice AeroPro leaf design on the base of the cartridge it's magnetic and this is where it plugs in and heats into the coil and charges it up and that's what the tip looks like these tips are usually colored to tell you what kind of hybrid or indica or sativa strain it is and Austan to designate which kind of strain particularly it is to differentiate it from the other ones with the color so what I'm gonna do this should be fully charged we're just about fully charged I'm gonna place this in here and then I put this battery so this will slide in and just slip in and click I'll take a drag and I'll show you how much vapor protection I get with this as the background then I'll flip it around a new one so it's a good vapor production a good Piney taste doesn't taste like sherbert but it tastes like pine which is very nice and fine so anyways I'll flip it around and then we'll do one more test it and then we'll go out with that piece alright so for all you AeroPro vapors and fans out there or indie co vapors and fans out there who now want to be aero pro vapors and fans check out the sunset sherbert it's a good hybrid it's got Finchel and camping in there if you don't get the terpene labels in your area I'm gonna do my best to upload those videos those series of videos when I get my next series of cartridges with the terpene profiles for those so you can match and compare for your area if you don't get those in Maryland we are pretty good with most places some places do it some places don't dispensaries do or don't have the terpene labels on there most of them do though so for those of you in other states where it's legal and you got a prescription or whatever and you want to arrow pro and you don't know what terpenes are in there you can watch my video series that are coming up especially for arrow pros or just about any other ones I usually list those out I don't know the strains strains for things other than a distillate cartridge much B will be probably different I'd imagine by region but for a distillate cartridge it should be pretty standard and universal maybe off by like 0.5% or like you know a percent or two but yeah so that should be helpful to anybody that's wondering what these arrow pro distillate cartridges have for terpene contents and if you don't know about terpene contents i've done videos on terpenes before so you can watch those in playlists if you've got a smartphone I've done too many playlists to view it on like a PC I don't know about and laptops but I don't know about top I mean a tablet but you can view all my playlists on a smartphone and I've done like terpene playlists and CBD playlists so if you want to learn more about that or if you're just you know already comfortable with it and you want to know more about what arrow pros got as a terpene I'll be making those videos but anyways we'll go out with another hit this is the arrow pro sunset sherbert a real smooth system I like it penniless Nessie AeroPro once again hope everybody enjoys enjoy yours if you're if you've got one if you're getting one and you'll enjoy it do my best to do a bit more product research for everybody on the terpenes peace out you", "H07YuDOAvb8": "what's up guys it's your boy rob here with another video right now I am gonna demonstrate alright this is a

the bonus the good part about it the oil really doesn't date that fast at all it seems to vape really slow the downside of it is it's just not that strong this one came in at seventy six point eight four percent THC and obviously THC percentage is not everything but I just didn't get a whole lot of strength effect on this I felt like I had to hit it quite a bit more than I do some of the stronger brands I would normally hit like an arrow Pro or select however you can tell it's good quality I mean it seems like it's made well this is actually the Nevada version they have California cartridges as well and this was the anytime that I tried in you can see the oil it's kind of a darker one and taste is okay not the greatest tasting not the worst tasting but it tastes alright strength is a little bit lacking for me but someone that wants something lighter that maybe is gonna vape for a while take like less hits this actually be a pretty good choice because the oil seems of a purely slow they use real see cell as well which is good but one thing you notice is the oil it seems to move pretty slowly because I hit it quite a bit because it wasn't that strong for me so I would give it that so if you want something kind of light that's gonna last a while good choice if you're looking for something really strong at this point probably not the best strength choice but I'm definitely to try some other cartridge at some point maybe see some higher THC percentage one ones and see if that changes anything so yeah yep it's like getting sea salt hit which is good so anyway for me probably not strength wise something I would try until I see a you know one that's gonna have big improvement on strength and I'll try it again but for someone looking something kind of a weak or hit it's not gonna be as strong effect it's a good choice and that's a review of the bloom farms cartridge particularly the anytime thanks for watching and have a great week", "JVA7yxytfWU": "ladies and

dude like for what six months or so going back a little bit yeah I mean like since we really got even anything going you were one of the first people I hit up man want to get on board with you guys and it's been I mean it's homies you know it's good times brand new do you talk about what it's like to be brand new to the market and the concentrate game Jeremy well you know I've been in this industry for a long time came from Mohammad ran that lab for about three years and starting up a new company in today's market is a completely new ballgame writer everything's changed and without it yeah competition is intense you know you really got to come out and separate yourself from everyone else especially in this field dude this field is blown up like edibles did in like say 2010-2011 like everybody's like oh [ __ ] I can do all this with edibles and now people are starting to learn a lot more and a lot more even though the research isn't all the way they're about concentrates and terpenes and all that fun stuff give us a little bit about your pedigree so that we know why you guys so know for sure what you're saying man I think it's just to speak to that point about the competition within the market itself I think it's an awesome sign of day of a maturing cannabis market you know it's something that as you were saying with the edibles they went through that and I think that concentrates are really going through that now you're seeing explosions in all segments of it whether you're talking about solving lists you're talking about what we're doing with hydrocarbon and then with we're getting our distillate lab going to so there's yeah man it's it's so it's it's super exciting time obviously across the board and I think that I mean we're tremendously proud of the product we've been putting out there there's some really fantastic product on the market so the competition's stiff right and and all in all though man I think it's just a really really good sign for what we have going on out here in Colorado it's becoming a legit business you know and a lot of companies such as harmony have some accolades that that are brought to the table you guys have cross stage a few times within your organization we have yeah despite our youth we actually took home a number of awards at the hem connoisseur cup and including best tested in several categories which was a huge pride point for us just a week we have art we have our own garden so it's definitely a huge testament to those guys to Peter who's run that back for us and I think just across the board it shows that I think we're doing the correct processes Jeremy's got us doing the exact right things we need to be doing in the lab and I think I mean it's yeah just yeah I've got a great team you know you're in the lab oh yeah I'm the lab director over there yeah you know we have a really good time we have a family environment you know work you know it's not you get out much to call ourselves the half day crew because there's a lot of 12-hour days I totally bet there's a lot it's crazy to see how the science goes with everything one of the things that I I've totally seen coming out and emerges emerging from this explosion within the concentrate game is that there's a lot of you guys that are making it then event homies that a lot of different companies here they're or the other you've worked together you've done a lot of fun things together and now you guys are all kind of unifying and just exploding the whole market that way absolutely I think we're you know we're bringing a new level of quality to the market that has you know we're filling a void if you will you know there's been a lot of inconsistencies across the board with a lot of companies and we're trying to change that everything that we do at harmony like TK was saying you know all our live product is all produced in-house right any of our trim product is all sourced by myself personally I've gone out to the facilities that we work with I've walked eyes Arden's I go out and handpick the trim that we're getting you know to make sure that it's the quality that we expect at harmony all right if it doesn't meet that quality standard it doesn't go out period so and I think that to piggyback on what Jeremy said and to speak to your point I think that's certainly something that sets us apart is that that commitment to quality standard in a vertically integrated consideration basically so with certainly having those controls over our live product as we're going you know we're going cut cut to dab really with that whole process and but then also working with really really fantastic vendors that that I believe you guys also talked about yeah yeah and so I mean that having those types of relationships where we can really manage what is actually going into our tubes to blasts and and then you know ultimately making having you know folks with tremendous amount of experience whether you're talking about G Army or GM price I mean these guys have been in the industry for a hot minute so they know what to look for and I mean we all are you know developing our keen eyes but you really can't you clearly can't you know sort of wave away at the amount of experience that we have across the board and at the just the fantastic vendors that we also work with for our dry rent and dry run products that's awesome I mean I know that relationships are utterly important we've been featuring harmony extracts add a couple of our shops we're about to have it out all three of our shops here soon which is really really exciting so make sure you come in and say world bio you get discounts all that but I had one of my employees my boy Doug love Doug I call him dougie fresh is they actually wanted me to ask you a question and I hope I can remember this because these are some terms that I'm not really familiar with sure no acronyms and [ __ ] within the industry so what is the biggest difference between your nectar and your 8i turb HTF SE full full milk i'd like to take a minute here and pause i've never once in three years heard Chad do not know Potter so that's the acronym there is the high terpene full-spectrum extract or high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract there you go yeah so HT f SE h CF SE and on the nectar is actually so this is a super super exciting product yeah let Jeremy is kind of his yes so you know the nectar is our form of the HTF se you know it's kind of been brought into the market under that name and I wanted something that was a little bit easier to remember and it was still recognizing it I could totally just want something a little bit more relatable you weren't trying to figure out what the hell the acronym is you know and and just something that was a little bit easier sounds cool go it is our HT f se I like what you guys have done if you guys aren't familiar with one of their products it's kind of a newer thing where you actually have the terpenes separated from the THC crystals right yes so um so we're actually that was kind of in our experimental phase what we were doing we were so essentially when you do a full spectrum extract well you're getting or two isolates you're getting a crystallized cannabinoid West ER h CF SE and then you're also getting a lower kind of liquid terpene solution right there as well so we were what we initially did was put them both into the same jar so essentially what you're getting there is those single source isolates that are just getting reintroduced together and it worked but we wanted to give consumers a little bit more control over there over there in total experience so for that we did we had it separated out and we had it in a one small vial with the terpenes right and then a small glass it was a lot of fun you know it took a lot of time and effort and a lot of collaboration you know I got a couple of really good guys back me in the lab you know Mike and Chris grind like nobody's business they're second to none you know it takes in the industry right there absolutely I mean their standards of quality you know it's it's awesome to work with a team that has such high standards you know right I mean and that goes from you know our packages all the way up to our GM you know I mean yeah it's across the board I like the logo I like the packaging it's pretty it stands out pretty well dude I know the product the products have been very well received you know when people come back to the shop for something it says something about that product you know when they ask for it by name and [ __ ] it means a tremendous amount to us that it's gotten received that way and also that all the fantastic work that Colorado harvest company has done to really serve to really support our stuff and to be an early adopter of our product I mean you guys had faith in us from the beginning and I might you know you we're homies and so I'm just super glad that we little if the staff is blown away then well I really appreciate that man I it's a big compliment to me you know we put a lot of time and effort into this so to get accolades and recognition it's it feels really good oh yeah and in something else to to kind of conclude that point about how we were doing the packaging we actually are now launching a whole a whole new packaging line up with the HTF SCH c FSC products we are you can actually purchase like a point to five grams of just the terpenes or you can buy like half a gram of just the crystals so it we initially when we had those the packaging divvied up we were letting nature dictate what ratios we were actually putting in there and I mean unfortunately consumers in nature sometimes clash of course so the the sort of perceived value on some of the terms some people weren't very happy with that so you've decided to take more control of that whole experience and we're going to be rolling out this new product we're actually rolling it out presently so it's something that yeah we're super pumped on and Doug Doug E fresh duty actually takes the terpenes and puts it in like a thing at his head in his in his house and you actually smell that all the time little girls running around at home a couple more years dude make sure that you come by Colorado harvest come me I think the next three or few Fridays you know next next Friday we'll be at the myself and Jeremy will be over at the Colorado harvest company on Yale and Aurora and then the following week will be over at Colorado harvest company at Cal amass and yeah well it'll

Tara pen full res shots will be in the link down below to my Instagram where I can give you full res shots on up besides to this now I am using a C cell silo with a dynamap fat mouthpiece for water use is the easiest setup you can do if you don't want it if you want to vaporize technically I would suggest this just a regular old any kind of bomb forty mmmm I would definitely recommend a different mouthpiece but I like this mouthpiece coming from dynamap is not just a mouthpiece it is an actual attachment piece as well but I really like that um anyway this is going to be my second day because I have to refilm this but I am still not feeling anything off it so I'm going to take another in dative head is that like a lot of cards to me or really flavorful I only notice them when they're a little bit harsh and taste but usually when it's harsher and taste I it kind of affects me better this is a very light a tasting cart you know it usually takes me four hits to reach where I need to be so it's still good I'm no complaints I mean it does take me a little bit to get high as well you know tolerance and now it's starting high but I will say this Terrapin wid their like their whole flower their carts on sometimes I'm not a big fan of how they manicure for their flower or their cart filling cos this is just ridiculous how big sometimes their bubble their fill bubbles are in here because they don't film this I don't know who does quality control and I really should be raining down the batch numbers and calling them and saying hey this batch in this batch if you're selling these to people you're they're getting ripped off you know okay's dispensaries are already ripping off people if you haven't heard cuz you know how much I standard battery costs like four five ten like a cheapo one twenty bucks plus no more than ten you should be spending on one of those old style like eco thread tight ones the worst part is they're not even ego thread they're just regular like spinner like the vision spinner Lynch I'm gonna say is [ __ ] from everything I've seen I never personally used one because I can't get better equipment so just a little ramp but um and if you didn't know the C cell so I low works by magnetic cap you screw on to the end of your 510 connections magnetic you know active draw there's no any limit so there's no real dosing with this it is by personal use and experience for me at doses fill up quite long basically so take another rep see where we're at you know they say it's an indica but when they have cherry diesel because around here our cherry diesel is either a true hybrid or indica it's not an indica it's a and like all this stuff I'm not a big fan of and I think why is on I think they're cherry diesel terpenes I don't know they actually because they do have the cherry diesel flower strain under them I don't know if they're adding like an extract terpene of it we're like they're actually doing it within the process I'm not sure but sometimes the Terps actually messed with on the quality of the product in my personal opinion you know for an indica I run in into God if you're gonna blend these terpenes in you know don't you like use real like you know because oh yeah special thing about this carton THC V appetite suppressant yeah you don't get the munchies with THC D you know putting that in quotations because it's not true science but is generally known and it's usually found in durban strains which honestly because this is co2 distillate right you can see that's another thing a lot of these cards are co2 I'm not a big fan of co2 because it actually drives down the quality because it's still leaving in those fats and stuff for the plant that's why I like ethanol is a really good methane and these aren't thinned out with like PG or VG thinners this is like pure extract so it's like be cool but I will get them props for the packaging it is this packaging is made from I believe they say at least 33 yeah 33 percent post-consumer waste and it's compostable packing you know what I might just put this in my warm farm for now on you know just take the stickers off but I'll put in my work for them [ __ ] if you didn't know I'm a fisherman and we and I bring my own bait so well that's compost oh I would say I don't feel high um even though my eyes are red I didn't you know I'm sleep deprived but um I would say I'm not don't feel high but I know I'm starting to get there um like and some strings hit me differently some some more than others so I don't know this is just more of a strange specific thing that I'm not feeling it right away but um I'm definitely getting there this is more of like you're sitting down type in to come you know you got like a good hour before you hour and a half two hours before you're going to bed you know so you can just sit there watch some Netflix and just chillax and then like you know what I'm getting tired I'm gonna go to bed that's this type of Endicott which is nice but I wish I was more of a harder hitting you know like more like oh [ __ ] [ __ ] sorry pardon my french you are high but yeah I mean it's gonna take a while for for me to get high but um yeah definitely check it out like I said we'd affects everyone differently it's affecting me differently you know what can you say but kind of lower the prices this happens 40 bucks and they're testing so low I'm not even kidding you the only things that are testing hires is divas at 90s for like discipline indicas aren't testing above not weight at best 89 if not lower highs why you know I know it's in its infancy but come on we can offer better pricing this is medicine this is not you know I understand your I understand you're trying to be a businessman come on lower the prices so we can buy more of your product that's all I got a anyway this is been a pax piece", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "d-CQWkbLw-o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of product reviews today I have a wonderful product I've put it to the test I've been using it relentlessly for the last couple of weeks and I'm really excited to unbox and show you another one what is it it's a 510 threaded vape battery and it's from vessel the people at talk belief were nice enough to hook me up with two of these at lift and I am absolutely in love with this unit to be very honest with you I've been looking for an upgraded 510 thread battery for a while I've been using the classic C cell battery for quite a bit of time now I have lots and lots of them lying around lots of different carts doing R&D and I'm gonna tell you all the benefits of this because it is really quite great so let's get into the unboxing you can see this is custom branded four top leaf and it's really nice nice packaging 20:19 vessel brand powered by vessel dadada performance air intake smart battery plus LED indicator three power settings two point eight volts three point two volts and three point 6 volts long lasting 240 milliamp battery we'll get back to that magnetic charging port all fantastic designed for people who know built by people who care the craftsmanship and performance of your top leave vessel is obvious from the moment you pick it up fits most 510 threaded vapes there's a one-year warranty and again this is made for top leaf sundial so let's cut into it it's got the shrink wrap on it which is really nice and these batteries are 79 to 100 dollars on their website I think they're on sale right now got the handy dandy corkscrew knife go [Applause] Thanks packaging sleeve vessel that's our actual vessels this is the you know custom branded one here's the box they all come in this is the black and gold and that's what it looks like as soon as you open it underneath the lid underneath the lid we have the warnings 5-volt or they're only press the button five times to turn off three times two cycle power levels for additional information visit vessel brand but there's really nothing more than that it is a simple ease of use piece of technology which is great get started charge we recommend fully charging your device before first use blinking red lights charging no lights fully charged low and remove the black cartridge and replace the you choice of top leave 510 thread cartridge you not overtighten the cartridge you can use any 510 thread cartridge enjoy power on and off with five rapid clicks press and hold the button your inhale three times spree rapid clicks helpful tips start the lowest setting with any chalk leaf oil your device will power down after 15 minutes charger that the duck tada and that's French because we're in Canada nope our neighbor will say even though I see it absolutely every single day here's our unit really really beautiful unit I really like the color scheme of this one the talked leaf black and gold is really slick you can see that they put the top leaf custom branding on it so a really nice piece of technology it looks very handsome this is the black and gold to me is very manly I really really like this piece it's like a nice pen for me it's like holding a bought Blanc pan or something really really slick so sitting in here just like this this is our unit behind there we have that piece and then we have the charging cable let's check out the charging cable first there's nothing left in that box there's nothing under there that's just a piece that's our box nice box so our charging cable is proprietary it's a magnetic charging cable and what's really interesting about this is that it actually attaches to the bottom because if you've experienced any other 510 threaded cart the only way you can charge these is by twisting it into this port I'm looking for a charger on my desk somewhere like this you have to take your card out now with the vessel there is no taking your card out you can actually hit it while it's charging and you have this nice magnetic port and you can twist that down and it locks it in pretty good not all the way I haven't found a complete lock with that to be very honest with you but I like that aside from it being proprietary which is always a hard thing with charging cables I personally hate proprietary charging cables but this one's pretty cool yeah I hope you won't lose it it's nice and magnetic it's pretty slick and that's how it charges now on to the rest of the unit this is where your cart goes it unscrews do not use this one it's just a burner in its place but what you can see about the unit and what I really like is if it focuses that's probably best there's air holes there's one two three four air holes right down here and these air holes allow for a really really beautiful pull absolutely beautiful to be completely honest I told you I had two so I have one right here I'm just gonna turn it on five presses let's see if this comes charged oh box yeah and it's on the lowest setting there you can see and I can do one two three you know change colors one two three now we have it on green and let's just uh you can see how nice the clouds are and the rip is so nice there's so much air coming through it so what I love about it I'll take this off and we'll put it on the other one just to show you what's going on and how great it works so I'm really a big fan of this unit not a paid endorsement at all just love the unit there it is with the fresh battery right out of the box you know it comes charged out of the box which is nice big things that I found with this battery with this with this fantastic unit is even though the C cell battery claims to be a 310 milliamp this battery actually has it claims to have smart technology and it's a 240 milliamp battery but it's battery-powered that's more efficiently being used and I really have found that with this battery I've been able to smoke a half car at half you know probably 75 puffs if not close to 100 puffs maybe 75 I don't want to exaggerate too much out of the pen before it needs to be recharged and it's really great what I've also noticed is the cartridge itself is not getting hot I often notice with this battery if I have two or three puffs if it cartridge gets really hot and the unit itself shuts down this unit I can rip it over and over again well I wasn't too big of a pup and it doesn't get overly hot the flavor stays great stays consistent and big thing about that air is it actually is really giving me a much better flavor it's not getting as hot I'm getting more air and I'm finding I'm getting bigger vapor clouds I really really enjoy everything about it so the airflow the design absolutely beautiful the way that the battery works that technology and the battery is fantastic but it's because it really is making everything last longer from my cart to the actual battery life love how slick it looks what else can I say about it I think it's a great unit the only knock is the proprietary charger but I see why they did the proprietary charger so that you could use your vape while it's charging and that you didn't have to screw in and screw out your vape dealing with all that nonsense just to charge really really cool really cool unit for a hundred bucks if you use carts all the time 510 thread carts this is the thing to get they have lots of different styles very feminine looking ones very masculine looking ones really enjoy this unit that's my review you know what 9 out of 10 haven't found anything wrong with it yet the way it would be 10 out of 10 is if it had and app and I could control to the exact degree what temperature the car was being vaporized with and seeing all of my data and my analytics behind the scene that's the only way this would be 10 out of 10 is if it had Bluetooth and it was connected to my phone 9 out of 10 loved the vessel battery if you smoke a lot of cards I definitely think you should get one thank you so much for watching I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "O-oShgS1Xy4": "hey what's going on guys welcome to deaf connection in this review I got the vessel batteries so the vessel battery is intended to use four cartridges only and primarily only four cartridges and honestly I love this battery beckham this is out of all the pens i've ever tried an experience this is honestly my favorite one this one is the smoothest the cleanest and um i can't find any con about it other than its price it is pricey compared to a lot of other batteries like cecil or like she saw Siler she saw palm and all that but and some of them even cost ten bucks but this one's really worth it you really do get what you're worth when you buy the vessel battery so there you let me tell you all the features this pen really is a is a really sleek pen and it really is that smooth and simple to use it's just three different modes um the lowest one being like being 2.8 volts right here and that's another thing too it's pretty cool do you need it's unique in the colors that it has I thought that was pretty nice but the last mode is a 3 point 6 volts I believe yeah pretty sure that's right at 3.6 so it's not as powerful as other pens as well but another thing is the batteries really efficient it lasted me a couple of days and it charges fairly fast charges it wasn't like one two three hours that will last me anywhere he's pursuing like I smoked consistently so I do it does last meeting between 2 to 2 to 4 maybe even 5 6 days so I think that was pretty awesome now with the battery with the battery itself like what I said honestly there really isn't a whole lot to it other than it's a sleekness how the feel of it this one this one's really nice actually I love this one will op up the only thing to the battery is um right here oh and there's another feature that I love about it it's the air flow this is what makes it amazing you see all this right here this thing you can actually take off but the purpose of that is for airflow is for to optimize and enhance their flow the taste and all that and it really does difference there are some carts so you could see in the post off if you read further below but there are actually some quests that don't even fit this but that's what the person is for so you could just take it off if the car is too why you're just too big to fit that's another cool thing you know something other this very has that you could take off is the bottom part but first I had no idea where to what to do with it but it was a little confused at first um but I didn't realize didn't tell you about more about it that the bottom part is actually for the purpose if you were to drop it because I've dropped my vessel battery a couple of times and it's actually I know what nothing came off no paint came off not really like major scratches anything at all but this pen can withstand like impact if you drop it or something like that so that's pretty cool it's this thing but this battery falls and like bends or something like that right here this will be the first of that just to take it off this is where you charge it really simply just connect it's a magnetic charge port but yeah that is a that's a that's pretty much all there is to it yep I forgot to mention so I what I said this is um this pen is really for carts only and um it fits any sort of 510 thread and another cool thing is these are actually meant for it it's enhanced Cecil cartridge it's so see so these Cecil cartridges are better cause supposedly for Cecil silo and Cecil palm battery but we personally believe it the vessel better hits a lot better than the Cecil batteries itself so that's another really cool feature and it looks just like if it's really smoothly guys it's like that thing too is pretty much as convenience and it's sleekness its discreteness and how it hits uh how it just enhances every hit it really you really get the taste of every single hit with the vessel battery I know I'm hated I'm gonna smoking right guys just see how you can see how its Cheers all right smoke isn't fairly thick it's kind of thin but it's still it's still kind of rip so doesn't rip as much as I'd like it to but it's pretty much it's pretty much all deficient semen so it does less like what I said it just lasts a long time in every hit you really do it it really just tastes a lot better like actually with this cartridge itself to some of the carts I tried it with my other batteries um I tried it with the G pen and stuff like that and it was the only actually really harsh this actually gives this really smooth hit so that's another really cool thing so that's the that is a vessel better you guys if um another thing is I forgot to tell you the price yet it is worth a hundred bucks so I mean it honestly like what I said you usually do get what you what you pay for this thing is really worth it if you've got smoke cartridges a lot and consistently if you're more of a wax kind of person or just like prefer smoking and smoking weed or anything like that then yet I wouldn't recommend this pen but I do recommend is battery for everyone who small carts on a consistent basis so that's the vessel battery um if you guys have any questions or comments and experience with it posted them post them down below and I'll see you guys soon peace out guys", "N3qRhLW_IAs": "hello Peggy the pot lady here today it's gonna be a little different I have been talked into telling my story about the first time I smoked weed back in 1960 1969 the year of my divorce that's when I first smoked my first joint it was back in 1969 I was getting a divorce after six miserable years of marriage it was the worst because back then women were second-class citizens second maybe even and husbands were always right men were always in charge and that in and of itself was enough to turn to wheat you see what I mean my sister my younger sister Kathy had been a hippie in the 60s and she's the one who introduced me to it and the very first time I smoked a joint it did nothing really did very little for me I think I got a little dizzy and that's it I was so disappointed anyway things have come a long way since the 60s now I rarely do joints anymore because I don't like the harshness with the paper you know when it burns it gives goes into your lungs so this is a vape and there's so many of them out there on the market I ended up last week getting an air pro because it's such a novelty the last vape I had had a cartridge that you screwed in well if you get too ambitious and you screw it in too hard and you pull it out then the guts come out and it breaks and I've done it three times so now I'm going to this where this is a magnet and you put it in and it just goes like that and it stays in and yes that means you have to buy special cartridges that are made for the air pro but so what you're going to buy a cartridge anyway right okay so this one happens to be black mamba this is an indica and so it'll relax the hell out of me and oh the greatest thing and and you're not going to be able to see this on the video is that it vibrates then I won't tell you why but now all the time that I was inhaling the pen has a little motor in it and it was blowing the smoke into my mouth so if it didn't have that little fam in it the delivery would be all on my own my own sucking strength which is fine but this gives me double the intake so I inhale as though I would a normal vape but I get twice the delivery you see so that's kind of fun it's just so one of the things about smoking a vape is something I learned through my boyfriend he told me that when you like a joint the combustion that ignites the these joint burns up 80% of the THC and that as a consequence of course finishing the the joint smoking the joint you get but only 80% of the THC now with veins that's not the case you get a hundred percent of the THC in the cartridge and of course you don't have the residual from the papers and you don't have to roll them and I just think they're healthier this one vibrates so it's fun but I digress the whole purpose of this video is to tell you about my first time smoking so the first time smoking I was not impressed and I told my sister I don't feel a thing so she knows ok well let's continue she gave me another hit and another one and we were driving in Marin County it was Marin County we were driving on 101 coming back from muir woods and all I remember was that it was a winding road coming down the mountain of windy road she was driving thank God because after about I'd say the fourth yet and I'm like oh this is so ridiculous you know it's a waste of time what does she find in this and then all of a sudden as the passenger I'm watching out the windshield and she is just taking these curves like and ready and my foot was totally to the floor trying to push on the brake and I didn't realize it until I like whoa whoa I got really like panicky paranoid panicky like she is taking these curves and you know 101 the sheer cliffs holy smoly I was like yeah when I kept on slow down Cathy slow down and she starts laughing and I'm like why is this funny and she's like because she knows I'm getting stoned while I'm telling her I don't feel a thing but you're scaring the hell out of me with your damn to the wheel turns and so that's that was my first experience so if I can summarize it was pretty harrowing I was really afraid of sitting there in that car with sister Andretti taking two wheel turns around the cliffs and complaining all the while that this smoking this weed was not doing a damn thing for me which made her laugh because she knew it was and she was right I was wrong so I must forgot to tell you about this because I'm going to be introducing this in future videos it is a capsule of pure CBD isolates and this stuff is total magic for me and someday I'll learn how to open it it's full of CBD powder it's a white powder isolates we're going to be cooking with that we're going to make some really awesome things", "5HjizTZsPeM": "[Music] hey it's Matt from Rafal studios and welcome to the placing gear review of the prism cartridge paper Iser I would like to thank the guys at Belle X for setting up and sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about this product or there are other products please visit Belle X techcom now let's get started here's what comes in the box you get the tiny little Velux prism vaporizer itself charging cord you also hit two different size cartridges as well as instruction manuals and the little magnetic connectors now let's take a closer look at the really cool little prism vaporizer I really like the shape and design the angular shape is really cool of tiny size and you see it has a micro USB charging port there and then there's one single button that's sort of molded into the side of the device there on the side really cool looking nice and boast of logo Velux there on the bottom and the bottom of the device is smooth there's no way to get into it or open it on the side of it there is the little port and the top has the fitting where you drop in your cartridges you can see it slides in there and that little port on the side lets you see the level of the oil inside of your cartridge and the cartridges that come with it are two sizes of a milliliter and a half milliliter and then you also have the little screw on adapters that will magnetize the cartridge and let you fit it into the cartridge holder and fit in place all right now we're going to take a look at the functions of features first we're going to charge it up I have one that's already charged up when it's fully charged it shows green light there and then when it's charging the light is red and it'll pulse to let you know that it's charging and then it's solid green once it's fully charged all right we've got one charged up and ready to go like most vaporizers you turn it on with five clicks cool little green light comes on just to let you know that it powered on and then you cycle through the three different temperature settings with three clicks each and come notice that the lights are very similar in color so sometimes it's kind of hard to tell which color you're working on but it's blue and light blue and a purple you see whenever you put a cartridge in there it lights up a couple of times to let you know that the cartridge is connected and then when you're connected you'll be able to actually hold down the button to get a hit off of it you press it twice and it has this cool little preheat mode and it'll just preheat the coils a little bit in there so that you don't get that little bubbling sound or whatever when you first hit it and then another really cool feature if you click it four times it'll go to this mode that is a tank heating mode and for a minute it puts really really low temperature on your tank so it'll melt those thick oils that might have run down into the coils before you use it really cool features there on the dual heating modes and then you cut it off with five clicks now we're going to jump into the usage and testing my favorite part and always like to make my own ejuice out of rosin and use a wax liquidiser or something like that to make it myself so I know what I'm getting so I've made us a mini Jesus and filled up two cartridges here these cartridges are really cool they're ceramic on the inside they have an innovative honeycomb shape there on the inside I've been around the coil and I'm really interested in checking that out and seeing how it works they're really good high quality feeling cartridges with the ceramic kits on them I like that so got one filled up here and we're gonna test it out and I mean I tell you what this thing gets one of the biggest hits off of any of these type of vaporizers I've tried in a while I'm gonna chop that up to those really cool coils great taste and man I'm telling you Big O Big O puffs and unlike a lot of vaporizers it the puffs continue up even after multiple sessions it's still getting big hits so I like that let's get to the results in scoring the pros are it's beautiful and stuff the design I love the shape because there's two excellent 510 tanks that are provided designs those tanks are designed for thicker oils if I teach the oils great those dual preheat modes are neat and it has those three temperature settings the cons are the battery is a little light with only 500 milliamps understandable for small vaporizer but it's also really hard to see the difference in colors of the LED lights for that reason alone I'm taking off a half a star but four and a half stars awesome little vaporizer from Belle X again I'd like to thank those guys for sending it out and for sponsoring this review check them out that Val X tech comm and

connection to your battery usually if you're hitting the button and nothing's happening at all this is the problem there's a connection point at the bottom of the cartomizer sometimes when you push it against the battery the piece gets stuck down so you just need to free it up a little and then then that causes a better connection all you need to do is take a tool any tool with a pointy edge really if you use a toothpick break off the tip so it doesn't get stuck inside you go right on the edge and just push it push it towards the center a little push it towards the center maybe a tiny lift but don't pull it because it'll come out and it'll be ruined so just kind of push it to the side like this push it to the side like that and that frees it up that if that doesn't free it up you just kind of push it and pull it up a tiny bit just a tiny bit like that depends are the same thing if your pen isn't working it's getting stuck you just push that piece right towards the middle anything with a pointy edge even this dull piece works to fix it thanks for watching", "oZcs4TpY5NM": "[Music] so guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be another sash video I do have my arrow Pro with me and if you guys didn't see that review I already did it's a fairly interesting vape pen or THC cartridge the whole system type thing I mean you can see right here arrow Pro and it's proprietary cartridge and when I say proprietary I mean like it is a 510 threading cartridge but there's a magnetic piece attached to it because usually with with the 510 thread II it would just come with Nick the thing here and then you just screw it on but this is the magnetic adapter is already glued or not glued on but on it so you don't really need to attach anything to it that is why I feel like this is a proprietary battery because let's just say I got a raw garden cart raw garden doesn't come with a magnetic piece so it wouldn't fit on this battery even though it is a 510 threading battery it is a magnetic adapter to it if that makes sense so yes we're gonna be doing basically like a little sash video there's a family walking by next to me but I'm just gonna be continued talking and basically just staring at the camera because I should really just try to ignore everything on the outside because that's just it's just clogging it clogging the video you know I got to get better at basically just ignoring the outside when I'm recording a video because all that really matters is just me and you guys listening to the video or watching the video anything else out here is just for looks and it shouldn't really matter I'm actually at a park right now near my house I'm about to go home after this enough talking [Music] so yeah with this pin in the vapor productions there I'm not gonna lie but the flavor I don't really like and it's just based purely on the string that I'm smoking on which is Northern Lights pretty sure other other strains are gonna taste different so I can't really judge it based on the taste of one cart one of their carts but other than that yeah we're just chilling you know I've been releasing videos and hopefully you guys aren't too tired of reuploads you know I just want to get most of my videos up on to this platform before I fully go daily again and if I do really want to go daily because like I said doing a daily video especially in this type of niche the cannabis niche it's a little bit draining and it's hard to come out by ideas that aren't just [ __ ] me excessive smoking or like challenges and stuff you know I know I know most of you guys probably enjoyed these like sessions but they do get pretty redundant you know I'm saying like I just keep uploading sessions tests I try to do vlogs when I'm out of town so yeah I just I just think that a daily Modesto vlog was just something that I wouldn't want to do I wouldn't enjoy doing don't get me wrong I like vlogging my day sometimes but when it comes to like interesting stuff I just tend to vlog more you know and Modesto as much as I love Modesto don't get me wrong but that feels great it's pretty boring here you know so people live out here and then they go out of City to have fun that's basically Modesto the only thing we have here is bowling and I guess we have okay Mall and a few good theaters but like other than that there's not really much going on here and I hope you guys can understand that that's why you don't really see me doing daily vlogs I rather just do a sesh with my homies because those are more ingenuine those are more just like Dave I feel like sessions include you you know like you're part of the group part of my group you know and that's that's the stuff that I try to convey like a lot of people they'd say they they really like my organic way of making videos because I don't really have like a transcript or a or a script I don't go by like [ __ ] uh what is it uh taking notes or anything I maybe I should but I feel like when I take notes I try to remember all the stuff that I took notes on it just looks like a stupid really I don't it just looks not as as fresh as my the videos that I like and don't get me wrong I'm I'm sure my videos could use a little bit more you know pizzazz or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it I'm sure you know there's stuff that could do better but right now I'm learning day by day and it's I'm having a good time you know this process even though YouTube hates me like I'm still having fun editing videos you know if I didn't like it I wouldn't be doing it you know even if YouTube keeps kicking me when I'm down I mean I am just gonna try to abide by their rules as much as I can because you know at the end of the day it is their platform and Who am I to say what goes on on there you know I'm just one dude you know I do feel it's a little bit unfair that you know other we tubers are thriving and they just seem to just like get me aaron richard also the we tube co-founder or the CEO or the ex CEO he also got deleted as well I'm not too sure about any other channels getting deleted like mine but I know his for sure and he had a pretty good amount of subscribers so Aaron if you're watching this I hope you're doing good man you know everything will get better YouTube is not the end of the world and you make good content so yeah I'm technology so if you didn't happen to see this product review and you're watching this video though somehow this actually vibrates it doesn't have a light indicator to know when you're hitting it but it does vibrate once you're hit registers it'll start to vibrate until you basically stop hitting it just to let you know just a more physical notification instead of just like you like what if the light was like down here and you have to look down here all the time and it's just especially in the Sun light you know sometimes you can't even see that light because let's just be real like sunlight just overpowers everything but yeah that's it for this session just a quick one we'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "DXY-iwykzNc": "[Music] corny dude oh you're recording you guys basically this video I just started I didn't say anything but what's up guys by now it's probably been a week since you've seen my videos because I got a strike I don't have you know I can't upload for a week so this will be uploaded [ __ ] a week from now or a week from when I got a strike so I don't know when this video is but I'm still making video so other than that I just like to mention that I got a new pocket from the people have pocket you got Randy over here where'd you get a [ __ ] on my top 5 cartridge video of 2018 I don't know why they did that [ __ ] I mean they said it was like sale of some ship I didn't link it to a sale of any cartridges just a you know a battery or a bait pain you know it's [ __ ] so that's my hater [ __ ] yeah we're still making videos I'm not I'm not I'm just saying it's gonna be a week since you've seen my videos we're preparing for it now you know yeah roll out we're having a little cartridge session on the inside first let me actually so I think they gave you a golden version yeah basically also I'd like to mention that basically there is another one they gave me for the channel but I want to figure out what's happening with my channel before I start this contest they gave me another one to give them to you guys you know leave if they hook me up so yeah let's do it yeah I hope you guys enter so you guys get a chance to win you know I think it'd be awesome just for you to receive a pocket I don't know if I'm thinking to be awesome it would be awesome Lucas glug so Dan that's a fat cloud ain't that high zoom oh man [ __ ] it's actually pretty long like 10 seconds you won't feel it though it's a smooth experience though with the pocket you guys already know this is my favorite bed like I said before I say anything else about the pocket this is something that is my opinion not not everyone else's you know what I say it doesn't mean that it is the say all be all you know and all be all type [ __ ] you know like this is why I like it feels nice the reason how why I haven't been using it is because mine broke due to my fault not because of you know faulty product you know it just feels nice and oh good it just has a has a chip in there and basically detects your cartridge and it basically adjust it to whatever temperature that it is going to be the best at you know it's great it's great product you could also press the button there's also preheating as well there's two batteries total of 960 milliamp sigh believe they're 480 milliamps each just a great overall product you know obviously after that he's probably gonna take another he's gonna be taking another hit or two but just make a video and just let you guys know that even though it's been a week I'm still gonna be making videos whether it be on YouTube or the we tube if I get deleted again on YouTube I'm still gonna create another one so you know this might be on that one who knows you know I don't know yeah it's been like a day so far so yeah another how many strikes can you get so like you get it like three and then I get two so if I get another one I can't look for two weeks but these are like videos that are like a year old already so it's like what the hell they're you just I don't know YouTube's weird but cheers guys that's [ __ ] weird a whole year ago see any stuff like hell [Music] yeah but on the bright side if you guys haven't seen by a week or already RJ has his new video out very very well edited for his first I would say his only video so far that he's edited by himself yeah yeah pretty good yeah thank you for the yeah I appreciate it so uh check him out you know at least one of them one of us is still gonna be on YouTube oh I'm still gonna be on you talk yeah if they delete me I'm still gonna be on there but airs right now we're being persecuted you know I'm saying so I don't know if someone's just flagging my videos cuz they hate or cuz honestly in that video I just provided all the brands that I thought we're good which i think is needed videos like that like there's so many fakes I just read on Instagram or some guy called blackness XYZ or some [ __ ] he follows all this beep [ __ ] that's like a like a legal [ __ ] that he just brings to the light and he told me that someone died in Chicago recently through vaping fake or illegal cartridges so I feel like those videos are necessary you know reputable brands should be known more to the public and federal federally legalizing cannabis to just it should be you know sadly to say that that probably is not going to be the only death due to illegal cartridges pressure has been more recorder yeah exactly so you know hopefully that I don't know it's crazy you know I can't say [ __ ] you know YouTube it's their platform I've been deleted before so it's nothing new to me and you know I'm not you know I'm over it you know I've been over it you know and uh I'll just create a new one and focus on the week two more because I finally seen the benefits of we tube you know I got a decent sized check but it was through the course of eight months and I really didn't really upload on there but it's good to know that that I got a check for that and I might just focus on that more who knows but YouTube has always been my passion you know live streaming has just been growing on me these past this past year or two so I'm taken to my head it's like am I kidding music - do I look like a head rush oh that high how my guys ever gotten hello I signify hit wished like hello brushing her head and I mean that's what's happening and yeah if anything you gotta say anything and say I appreciate it you guys Wow I already love these [ __ ] right other everybody knows what it is be fabulous we help each other it's only way we're all gonna make it I'm saying so yeah I mean I'm not gonna be scared and delete my videos I know my videos aren't [ __ ] like selling illegal [ __ ] or anything I'm just [ __ ] smoking the [ __ ] and telling you about it you know so other than that I will see you guys the next one peace out [Music] [Music] [Music]", "iYl7nyyKbnE": "Hey everyone and welcome back to VapeFuse.

got a magnetic one of the things I would do is slightly loosen it it allows a little more airflow now at the same time I'll let you know on some batteries if you loosen it too much or the connector is kind of weird it just doesn't even hit at all but I've noticed on some when the earth was a little tight try loosening a little bit and sometimes you'll get that looser airflow better hit then you would there you go", "df3VjGHuAD4": "hey guys its definition reviewing the arrow Pro Black Mamba rift fabulous and a searchlight bowling alley and you know look like a darker color oil but it tastes awesome this tastes awesome oops the strength is in the high 80s comes in about eighty nine point four eight four percent excellent strength excellent flavor arrow Pro has definitely become one of my favorites arrow pros available in multiple states you can get it in California Colorado Nevada maybe some other places too this black mama just reaffirms in AeroPro really is really one of the best out there great quality and this seaso gold hardware also helps you'll see our general review on arrow pro and we'll show you that information we'll take it I'll show you what it looks like as soon as you see as you see hit strong it just hits like a strong sea so maybe is a little extra kick to it has a little vibration when the battery is going but this black mom is a great strain and overall I got to say arrow pro is a great setup thanks for watching guys is deaf connection and have a week", "6cmI6BwLog8": "hey guys Logan here from o2 V gonna show you today how to fix a connection plate we get a lot of calls coming in with customers who think that their battery is broken when they go to draw on the cartridge it appears the battery's working but they're not getting a vapor from the cartridge generally when this happens it tends to be the connection plate so what I have here is one of our push-button 510 thread batteries if you look down in between the threads with the cartridge off in the middle you see the circular connection plate so what happens is that generally gets pushed down when either a you screw the cartridge on too tight or be when you go to screw the battery on to the charger and screw that on too tight so a very simple fix what we often tell people to use is just a paper clip and if you stick the paper clip in between the connection plate and the threads and you just pry towards the middle it starts to raise that connection plate up be very careful because it comes up extremely easy you don't think of it a lot of pressure what you're gonna do is you're just gonna walk around the battery and bring that whole plate up to about the middle of the threads once you go to put the cartridge back on after this you should have a good connection and your bad we should be working in it thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "nybGCMgimyA": "hey man dizzle - hi koala what are we doing here today we're gonna talk about these guys right here these silos silos are made by Cecil I was actually puffing on mine over there and that is why I am as high as I am right now I'm gonna tell you everything about this well being on cloud nine what color I want the blue and give me that okay so we have blue we have gray black and the pink one I'll take the pink one the color inside of the box good news it comes with everything you need little things that you just screw into the bottom of your cartridge it comes in all it looks like a pill tow package and then a charger this one does not have any button or anything you need to press in order to hit it pantry is our favorite so it is magnetic that's right in and you can also see a local oil but you'll have left this looks kind of interesting in comparison to their other one palm palm is a little flatter thinner with a wider and they're both very sleek very interesting they both have like the stainless steel type kind of feel and design you can find the silos and the pumps as well that we reviewed earlier on the Hamilton devices website Hamilton Feist is calm Hamilton device is calm to find all your C cell needs if you're looking for a really really really good battery check out see saw the silo I'm a huge fan it's very small it's very cute it comes in a couple of different colors yet Nancy Hamilton devices also they have empty cartridges available or you could just purchase the battery by itself thank you so much for tuning in to this review we hope you liked it check out Hamilton devices calm for any other products follow subscribe share with anybody that is looking for a new battery and we'll see you next time bye guys", "ps32Z5PM7Ec": "what's up guys fake earpods perot are here within a month of release of the original earpods pro there's already so many clones that have flooded the market and these are apparently one to one perfect in every single way from the originals they took about two years to actually perfect the design these it's astounding how efficient and Chinese market is at getting these outs as soon as possible so we'll take a look at these I think these are called these super copies and then there's I five hundreds and from packaging to the actual product to the software these are apparently one-to-one and I'm curious how deep that goes okay so let's take a look at that package you begin with first off the quality is of course worse and here we've got more of a gray look and not as detailed on the image but it is embossed it's a nice little touch we've got the same air pods Pro wireless charging case on the side it is reflective silver also apples packaging by the way the easiest way to tell is you're not gonna have to use a knife or your teeth to get into the packaging of air pods Pro it has a pull tab here does not the sticker is not separated into on the side it's one solid sticker here so the attention to detail is pretty dang good ok so just from the packaging you know unless you're experienced or you've seen this video you're not gonna know so seeing lots of these in news actually getting my hands on it we'll see if the pairing process is just as easy apparently this has the h1 chip inside of it whether or not it's bluetooth 5.0 it's gonna be hard to tell but ok so here are the air pods so they seem a little light I will do a little weight test they came in sideways like this not proportioned correctly to how you open the box so there's no pull tab to remove the plastic already a big difference just in the opening experience it's on the inside a defect and of course we do have our lightning to USB C cable which is a nice little touch paper tabs as well so the customizable earpieces are completely missing from the packaging one size must fit all here all right and wow I'm impressed that looks really really good and they popped up right away on my 11pro max here so that's amazing that's magic by the way this is on iOS 13 point two point three so it's on the latest version and comparing these side-by-side so the LED it it's not flush it has a little hole in it you can tell that it's not the same quality there but it's a bright green little LED same as apples just not as diffused on the bottom here lightning port very high quality looks good and this was specifically in the listing is that the hinge was mat and oh that's so funny oh no it's not it looks painted on for a seconds but I'm actually amazed that the tolerances are smaller than apples apples has a gap between the hinge this one does not also the button positioning and the text is a little darker but no one would be able to know unless you have them side-by-side so impressive work on the hinge and it feels very solid like the snap feels good it sounds really good this is apples a little deeper a little snappier I actually prefer the sound of this one it sounds more like the originals huh Wow look at that so on the inside of the casing you'll find serial codes here letting you know that it is a real product and apparently they're from real ear pods Pro but don't you dare try taking these to the Apple store let's check out the actual little bulbs and I want to do a weight test here in a second but compared to these relatively the same way maybe apples feels a little bit heavier so on the bottom here you can tell that the charging contact points are not as beautiful as apples it's taken straight from the first generation air pod so not as beautiful but it'll do the job and there's a grate there for a speaker exhaust I believe hmm definitely not one-to-one in that regard also there's text here underneath the bulb a portion next to the sensor so that part looks good and here we've got painted on sensor so this actually doesn't do anything it's just painted there's no speaker grate here whatsoever so that is not one-to-one and the actual ear portion does not have that large of a hole so I can definitely assume that the sound quality will not be the same here it does have a force sensor here but from what I understand it probably does not work I mean that's fancy piece of technology that our highly doubt they'll be able to reproduce that and do these come off oh they do huh and that's what it looks like so it's a very dinky looking exhaust hole this is the difference between $80 to 250 dollars that's sound quality there I very much do assume that these will sounds nothing like apples also wanted to see how strong the magnet is inside of the cases so if I try and fling them out oh wow it's actually really strong and will they fit each other's cases so this is a fake one it does fit into the original and vice versa so a little bit loose which hmm and it does close there it is the design really is one-to-one in terms of size but they're using different technologies for the actual sound and charging still is impressive that they were able to reproduce it in such a small little form factor okay so let's get to connecting and sound quality now I'm genuinely impressed that they were able to get this menu and spoof it from what I understand it's a Mac ID spoofing they're not actually cloning the h1 chip but it still works and it's incredibly fast so that's apples original we're not getting the same animations yet but let's go ahead and connect connect iPhone hold the button will hold it on the clones and there it is so it did connect we've got ear pods Pro showing up on our iPhone cloned and part of the listing did mention they will show up over here does show the air prods Pro charging if I pull one out yes it does show up as right that's amazing the integration is sically om okay so with that connected I want to play some post Malone let's check out that fit and they feel really good like this feels like the OEM one they're the same size they do seal off the ear canal it's somewhat noise cancelling I wouldn't say the same effects and you put in official ear pods Pro there's a seal and pop effect it's really cool until you try it you know you don't really know what I'm talking about but suddenly the world goes silent and this does not have the same effect but it is more noise cancelling than any other air pod clones that I've used so I guess it somewhat has that I highly doubt it's gonna have the integration ya know noise cancellation integration but it does show up as ear pods Pro so about half away it's pretty loud about 75% oh yeah most definitely this does not have the quality of original ear pods let me pop one of the real ones in so I'm attempting to share audio it detects them but then doesn't actually let me share audio to them they get struggling with that would have been interesting just for my little analysis of listening to them I gotta tell you the sound is not that good I mean it's clearly a downgrade it's 70% of the sound I'd say of the originals maybe 65% you're obviously not getting that noise cancellation and it's pretty clear just no bass there's like almost no bass whatsoever definitely more of a tinny sound and of course you're not getting any of the software features such as transparency mode it also doesn't show up with the little logo in the control center letting you know it's a generic earpods Pro clone so the software integration could be better but it does work it connects very fast be prepared not to get the same sound as Apple's original there's a very wide margin between those two in terms of sounds but still I'm very stunned that they were able to get this kind of sound and out of such a small package within such a relatively short amount of time so wireless charger is working as pop these see if they have a coil inside and it appears they do not also wanted to test the individual weight of the air pods Apple is five point four grams and clone pod is three point two six so Wow actually a significant difference between the two it feels lighter now that I saw the specs apples entire package is fifty seven grams almost and this one is thirty seven so twenty grams lighter I'm just picking them up yeah this does feel more solid it's a little dinky little light so clear difference there in terms of quality and before I forget I do want to test the controls for switching music it's not a press the forced press sensor doesn't work so they retain the tap function from the older clones no force press this is all a gimmick here on the side so don't expect that to work and lastly a test I want to do is testing the electromagnetic interference radiation coming from air pods and metric usually people don't care about but this is something you're putting next to your brain what do you want it to be safe apples air pods are playing and right next to them I'm getting about four volts per meter if I step away from them it drops to about two so say about four volts little over four volts per meter for point two it was a baseline of about two volts per meter next to the fake oh wow six volts per meter near the fake ear pods pro so definitely over five five point five that's insane so you're getting way more electromagnetic radiation coming from fake ear pods versus originals I don't know how harmful this is but that's two volts per meter more than apples if anyone knows more about this leave a comment but that's kind of scary Bluetooth 5.0 and apples versus whatever Bluetooth this is about 30 feet it's still holding strong 40 feet 50 feet still good straight line of sight I'm able to get a strong connection on both even at 100 feet passes the range test yes these look like ear pods Pro they connect to your iPhone like ear pods Pro but they do not have any of the features that make ear pods Pro amazing nor the sound quality so $80 200 depending on where you buy them from are they worth it I don't know you really have to want to flex on somebody to spend this kind of money I mean I'd rather just save up and get the full amounts it's just not worth it compared to apples maybe if the price comes down to like $50 sure but at 80 plus I don't I can't justify that price tag even though it's a very good clone of apples I'd still of course go for apples any day well keep an eye out for any better versions of this otherwise thanks for watching peace", "scJpP2NGp3E": "hi uh fellow vipers around the world um just thought today i do it's uh how are you all doing anyway and sorry child village viper coming at you from ireland today i just thought i'd do a a kind of video on how i started oh excuse me um the different devices i used and some of the you know you hear a lot of terminology when the uh hobbyist vapor talks you know direct lung mouth to lung ohms coils wire cotton tanks rti's rdis you know rdtas rsis but you know all does mean something but i'm gonna try and just uh but i'm just gonna have a vibe here and by the way on vaping direct lung 52 watts on a rebuildable tank called the coiling mini and i have a bit of this juice in it which is dead rabbit society it's a new york cheesecake it's very nice i have one more fight no i'm not i'm going to show you is right this is what i first started vaping on i'm going to show you here it is this believe it or not you see the black this used to be all black and it's was what what's known as a a pen you know that's your traditional vape pen if you you fire button there one two up one two three four five off and one two three four five on so simple as that you get your cartomizer it's known as on top my hands are a bit in my hands if i was just eating some garlic bread it was really nice very greasy though so using me club right get a grip on this now and just ah don't get to unscrew this i'm surprised these batteries have had them seven years and they still take a charge so yeah cartomizer basic cartomizers just uh this is a it's a just fog yeah just for cartomizer you fit about two and a half three mils and this uh what you do you take your top off here there's your coil you coil that's the red bit with the red on now just quickly demonstrate take the unscrew your coil yeah that's unscrew the coil and there's a coil there closer look at been using it obviously and there it is just fog you still get these today you know no problem the pens are a little bit different i think i don't think you get you get the ones i have anymore well i do have some just fog ones as well but i have about five pens then you screw your top on yeah fill it up with a bit of juice by the way when it's open you obviously don't fill it all the way and then uh screw you and what you're to be want are vaping on a pen now this is our eye your drip tip on top it's just a standard little you know it's a kind of a sort of a 10 drip tip really just give that a wipe off but yeah it's a pen kit so when i started feathering a graveyard cut long story short there's a feather in a graveyard vaping um i asked him about it he said there glad he said have a couple of puffs on this he was an older guy so i had a couple of puffs and i thought and that's all right you know i was 18 milligrams he was smoking just tobacco so i had a couple of toots and um a couple more two she said go on two way and uh i thought this is quite nice actually so three days later i got sat with two of these that caught they were called email by volish a polish company it was sat with two of these and two these are this is just fog but it was two emailed cartomizers so anyway i got them i got the two pens and no word of a lie i never looked back but never smoked an another cigarette in my life never except for once when i had a heated argument with someone and despite my own nose you know and all that i actually got a finger tobacco smoke to roll up and it was absolutely disgusting that was after about six years of not smoking and i swore never never again would i touch a cigarette but anyway so um yeah i'm gonna show you a bit of vapor production and that's a pen set like i said i've another one here and what what what you can actually get for these are great to start on to the two and uh yeah but they're great to start on but this here you can get these no problem in little garages and shops this is a disposable cartomizer so yeah this is a disposable cart margin they usually sell pen sets are very cheap the battery i'm not sure what the battery is you you have your usb you get your charge cable you know have a look at that see your usb there outfits into the bottom there and you charge till that goes green so anyway show you a bit of vapor production um you know it's not often it's not really that satisfying to me nowadays but to this day i still bring them out with me sometimes in the car or with another person so i'm gonna take um a puff on one with this is a more there's a couple of spare coils you can still get them see just fog there coils for the for your clearer myself or cart my eyes or whatever you want to call it but it's it's basically an ee pen you know it's a device for vaping i forget what liquid i have in there it's actually even a bit bent i've had it that long so and take a pull on it and straighten it out and yeah yeah it's actually cherry memphis and that's quite nice as well it's 18 milligram you know so yeah that's your an e pen you know great for starting off going to show you something now in a sex very similar to this that i progressed on to yeah so you know it's a fair amount of vibrancy satisfying you get the nicotine here especially with 18 milligram the only thing is you use your 50 50 vgpg you don't want to really be put in 70 40s in because you you know your coil will too heavy a vg like this is 50 50 the bigger bottles you see you get you know ask your vape shop for some advice as well but they're usually you know vg is vegetable glycerin pg is probably glycol they're both natural they're both found in food products drinks medical things you know that they're harmless they're totally on and flavouring that's all that's in any liquid you know have one more blast on this a cigarette this one believe it or not actually used to be black as well i tell you it's really nostalgic actually because um you know when i do vape on these it reminds me of of packing in smoke and you know i never would i don't even have to stop vaping i i just i'd find a way to vape you know i'm obsessed with vaping i really really am i'm a of a lot of i've acquired a lot of things i only one thing i got sent to me for review and i'll show you that later but i do reviews on youtube and the name is like the vaping villa the village vapor sorry my real name is joe nice to meet you bloody drip tips coming out it's old you say [Music] yeah but as you can see good study enough viper time as a cigarette light you know i'm gonna show you now this is moving up the ladder a bit like you think i'm taking the pieces this usually black as well is and and you can you still get these now that they're very very popular is some aspire pokes you know i wasn't going to get all new mods to do this because it would cost me a forging but not a fortune you can get these for any decent value shop will sell these for 25 euros you see the same story you have your usb and it always pays to get a plug you know with the adapter get the right one and you have your little usb charger that fits into your usb port now this the aspire pockets i'm pretty sure is uh it's more powerful than than the pen obviously that it's a built-in battery but it's a lot more powerful so i've got a bit of juice in there to fill this one you i'm gonna get me towel for this you unscrew the top yep your mouthpiece there the call usually comes out with it yeah the calls come out with it you see that and then you get your bottle of liquid i'll just kind of demonstrate a little bit for any newbies but yeah you take that off mates all that stuff and then yeah pour your liquid in into it you know it actually has a fuel level on it when it's new i just gauge it i don't really use it anymore but i'm just showing for educational vaping purposes hopefully you can make the switch or you have made the switch for being better but yeah the pockets i'd sa aspire that's actually a spare coil a spy coil does it tell you what yeah and the wattage i'm not going to go into ohm's law and that's another but this is 8 to 20 18 to 23 wall watts and it's a 0.8 pockets coil all the vibe shops sell podcasts very it always stuck it stuck around you know it's a popular get off the cigarette so let's see the viper production on this it's fully charged probably not as strong as it used to be but let's see so yeah you can see a bit more vapor you know a bit cloudier yeah and the satisfying and when i first got this it was especially with a fresh coil and it's lovely and and the coils are really economical you get a kit for like i said 25 30 a few calls bottle of juice a couple of bottles of juice 45 quid maybe that's gonna last you a couple of weeks you know that's the aspire podcast remember that was this is a real i'm recommending this now is a real good device to start on take one more time yeah as you can see you know a bit more vibing than the pen and then i'm gonna yeah i went for a few little devices i'm gonna show you another device here which i don't really i didn't really think much of it's called this is a disposable pod the vibe you can charge it again you view a usb usb port there you know as i showed you the lead and actually you know the story but you get what you call disposable yeah if i can get it bugger off you get disposable cartridges yeah you just put them in and it's one two three four five is off see the green led light there and is that still on oh well it's it's five on and five off so i see a bit of vapor out it's been sitting around this i'll try it on there but these are good they're about a 10 or a 10 to start your viping as you can see i'm not bad i'm not bad off the vibe you know it's not bad but i just i'd rather have something not something a bit more solid but you know it's good to do mixed berries menthol tobacco pods the pods are about four 350 each but that easy see you to die out and i'd recommend if you're going to get one unit you might as well get two and have it fully charged in case you if you're a heavy smoke it's not going to last you today the battery capacity on this i'm not too sure either i think it's it's actually for it's uh do you know what i can't see i definitely need glasses but i'm trying to look for yours but anyway yeah it's not bad you know it's so as you can see though yeah the value production's not bad this is uh while berries are having it's nice anyway move on from this that's a disposable vibe disposable pod device about a tanner will start you off and you'll get a couple of pods in the kit as well and you get the pods separate it's a shame because they're not refillable and moving on my next device i got i was actually uh i kind of stepped up in the world i've got myself a nautilus tank you know it's the first sub on tank that i ever got and i actually have the first i'm going to show you now the first fullest control man i'm not i i ever had and this this has never let me down it's lost and a lot it's a single 18650 see the screen now it's at 20 watts or something i'm just going to show you the battery door it's totally safe i know it looks dangerous but it's not it's just a paint chip there's all safety chips in this for years ago it's a great mod so i'm gonna slip the um this has a lasted the test of time is as well the nautilus tank you can get the coils no bother at all so i know it's 18 watts so just turn that down to 18 what this actually mod goes up to 60 watts it's one of the first you know kind of sub arm mods that was out cost me about 50 at the time but i have a draw on this now see the difference in the vapor production you see you can actually use uh 70 for a uh heavier you know e-liquid something like charlie chaw dust or any you know 70 for your 64 he full it's always vgpg you know but this nautilus tank yeah you've little airflow you see a little airflow on the top there and what you can do is adjust that adjust it see it it's closing it's opening i want to get it i'm gonna have to hold it down there so that's fully open the airflow having here some cherry or something but take another tote as you can see a lot more vibe and more satisfying at this time by the time i got this i was well off the cigarettes and then i'm gonna show you i started getting tanks like this isn't an old tank this is a hell of a md it's a mouth to lung tank you can see the the air control on the side there from one hole to a big hole to a slightly bigger hole that's your air intake and uh anyway i'm not going to get too technical yet but i'll take the talk on this uh i can turn this up a bit to this is like sub on vaping you know i have my own building here with some now move on wait a minute for that but that's uh 34 watts yeah um as you can see much more much more vapor really satisfying mix my own juices i always mix six percent so that's two knit shots into a 50 ml bottle will give you six percent nicotine which is is satisfactory it depends on you know how much you smoke and now they're gonna have a puff on this so yeah like i said much more satisfying um then yeah i love this smart i really i really don't care what anyone says about you can see the brand name there just about volish and control nano v2 it's a temp controller really great mod i'd love it i'd love to get a new one of these actually i think you still can but anyway then started moving on to things like you know pods this is a this is a pod kit so you have your device it's uh usb again so out comes your lead usb leads you plug it in put it in there right see now that's kind of greeny white that's fully charged but it's kind of purpley white fully charged and i have a 50 50 18 mil in here this is the nautilus all-in-one and this is they're really good for stopping smoking as well because the nautilus see aspire same as pocket stone makers pop cat aspire because it's like yeah aspire nautilus all in one great device for giving up because all vapes are older for any vape shop you go into does aspire nautilus uh i think this actually takes the podcast coil as well if i remember rightly it does but yeah this is a spineless so here we go you see not quite as much as the the last one but that that's different that's a rebuildable you know that's a tank up that i i put the calls in and whipped myself i'll get on to that in a minute but as you can see um yeah satisfying i like the the nautilus all in one it's okay and this is a coil you get a separate calls for it you get a you get a 1.8 coil which this is a great little cause my preferred you get a 0.8 which is a bit more of a looser draw you know if you're going one point something eight a full line one arm it's always going to be a tighter draw so it's a mouth to lung draw uh 0.6 0.5 0.3 they're all going to be looser coil drawers you know with more more airflow you know you can adjust the airflow and the nautilus all in one as you can see there and i'll put that down out of the way yeah you can adjust your air flow and yeah that slot there see that's wide open that's shut wide open obviously you can't use it if it's uh if it's shut but that's wide open anyway so clip that back in and you can also get spare pods your spare pods for this and your spare normless coils again most vape shops do them that's the reason why these devices are also reliable you know and dependable you you're getting it nearly a for a year a heavy smoke of mine get a full day of a full charge on this and again i'm so the i think the capacity on this is is about 600 uh is 600 miles between six and seven hundred mile could be five ninety yeah nice satisfying and the coils keep up you know another drought i hope someone's finding this this bit interesting i am actually because i have all the stuff in front of me um you know like i said it's kind of a bit nostalgic but anyway then show you another i've done a review on this the other day it's another little pub mod the smok rpm 40 and it goes up to can you see that 18 watts it goes this one this little one goes up from five up to 40 40 watts sorry yeah 40 watts and same thing it's a pod you get your coil there i'll show you um you can get spare pods you can get yourself a couple of pods you fill up there's this little membrane on the side you just pull this pull this up and get your bottle of juice and i'll just kind of i'm not going to fill it because it's full already but i'm not sure and you fill it you know and then put your make sure you don't feel it too much and make sure you your coil is in i'll have a coil here there's a there's a spare rpm coil and this is more of a mouth to a direct lung sorry depending you do get you you do get um a one point i forget now kind of a mouth to uncle but it's not a very good mouth to lunge or it's more of a direct but we'll try this uh the coil is good for 19 watts i think 12 to 19 watts so well however going it's a good little thing is the smok rpm 40 definitely another another odd ideal for beginners you know here we go 19 watts um yeah really satisfying you know this would you definitely get if you want a lot of smoke and a good intake i've um i'm smoking 18 milligrams because i'm quite happy vapers like 18 milligrams and this might be a bit too much for a lighter smoker but for me i took another yeah as you can see good bit of viper production this tights uh you can put your heavier oils in here the coils will take 70 30 mixes so you can mix your own juice which is great gonna just give it a little wipe your hands oily but uh yeah it's a great little and oh usb in seeder usb and the bottom to charge up it's an internal battery it's uh uh what is it again i think it's um i think it's 1200 1200 mile mar is milliamps so the higher the mar the longer lasting like i said uh the aspire where did i put it is about 500 to 600 this is nearly a thousand miles so you you'll get the die out of this and the pods are generous to hold a lot of e-liquid and when you if you you get into vaping more you can actually get an rbi section which means rebuildable atomizer you can put your own little coil in but until you learn how to do that and it's quite fiddly because it's very small as you can see the coil imagine putting your own little coil into this and your cotton wool and putting it into the holes and that so you you you're doing it right now practice practice makes perfect with vibing and patience so i hope you had the rpm fully great for giving up or a gift for someone who's a smoker and wants to start vaping and don't forget you know you can get all the flavors whatever flavors you want but yeah the rpm smok rpm4 is brilliant you know and it's only 19 watts so yeah definitely get the whole day out out of this little one you know and then now moving up the vaping ladder a bit this is a a good a great little device as you know it's a like i i have i have a couple of fewer ages models um this is one of them that i just keep vape yeah the aegis geek fight this is the is the ages boost plus and uh you can see here that's your pods where your liquid goes in you fill it up here yeah there's a little little rubber gasket there see there you fill it up it's hard to see because of the blackness i'll tilt it up but you see the holder yeah that's where you fill it up and then you put pop your gasket back on your air flow is there see the side there you can turn it up you can yeah you can turn it up all the way open [Music] that's old while now is it that's not how i've burped my side yeah here we are yeah i saw the way open as you can see and this is halfway open so whatever airflow you prefer give it a little wipe but um yeah this is a great little device so no atomizer and this is moving on by the way you can get spare pods you can get as many pods as you like for it there's two pods there and uh your coil is just a press fit coil so you just pop your coil out i have to be careful doing this keep me finger on the top because a bit will leak out there's your coil you just line it up you line up the square with the let me see even uh yeah you do there's two flat ridges uh you'll see them and just press your coil in you fill it up white for about five seven eight minutes and you're ready the vibe so i'm gonna plug this in and the great thing about the aegis boost is right and that's a bit tight is it's definitely moving up the vaping ladder because it's an 18650 battery you know so you put in your your positive side i need to change the cover on this because you need to know your battery saved it's a little bit nicked up here so you know a little bit nick there and now it's okay it's not going to blow up or anything it's all you know these devices have safety tips built in but i'm going to screw i'll show you that actually yeah put the battery in goes positive that's your positive side like i said it doesn't need to wrap that's for another video you've got a little screw on cap and see the battery in there you just screw your cap on and that i just boost coil i have in there is rated for i forget now i think it's about 20 watts or 25 watts but you'll see the screen there you see it i'll switch it on again and it actually goes up to 40 watts the same as the rpm but it's more sturdier you know and it's a battery so no no problems you can carry a spare battery around with you you know yeah by the way if you are carrying a spare battery get yourself a few of these it's just a silicon battery holder stop your battery from because if a bit of mat will touch both ends at the same time some coins or keys you know you the battery could vent or he's not very safe so yeah little carrier that's perfect you know there are only like 50 so most vape shops give you a free one with each battery you buy and that's 18650 battery so anyway we didn't take this one for a tote yet so see you have your display there you have your watch your arms and but you haven't got to worry about that stuff till you you know as you get into it you learn you learn as you go along that's how i learned and from watch reviews watch if you're thinking of buying watch legion vibes mike vibes me if you want to but um my vibes uh viping with vic uh chai eyes uh matt from sim and the vaping biker yeah legion vapes he's my favorite but let's take this for a talk anyway you can see a bit of a vibrant production at all now that's 40 watts that's too high but there's supposed to be an rba for this as well i haven't got it myself but 20 watts okay yeah as you can see you know you you have the power there real really good coils of a lot of uh i like this mod even for for the most experienced vibra if you were going camping or away and you know i bring you a spare battery big bottle of juice you know because the coils like i said no problem no problem taking 70 40s so as you can see keeps up [Music] lovely acts i think i've got a bit of pineapple in this it's beautiful yeah pineapple pineapple coolada i think it's uh 12 monkeys pineapple collard have one more tote yeah so that's that's what's known as a pod mod and it's it's direct lung you know your direct lung in that on one i've forgot actually is um and this is excellent i i can't get enough of this this caliban g it's like it's beautified this is my all-time favorite pod mod yeah yeah take you see all you do is you have your pods you can see the juice in there yeah click off it's a bit of a bugger the only thing about is one column of it is is getting that yeah you click the top off you see you've a little red membrane there you fill it up there you put your coil i'm gonna show you now i'm just gonna click that mouthpiece back on click you can hear it go and there's a spare coil you can get one home uh 0.8 ohm 0.3 ohm zero ohms arms there's loads of anyway you can get a lot of different coils for it and it's uh it's for nick salts and free base which is you know adding your own nicotine in but cools in it are great i'll just quickly show you just pull your coil out here as you coil yeah actually cool looks small and just slipper back in you'll see the flat part where you've got i'm gonna have to take it off camera for a minute but yeah this is the uh get in there you bugger this is the uh the caliban jake it cost you about uh you know what i'm such a numpty sometimes i get these things and i forget myself and i'm doing a review yeah that's it that's in so i'm going to put that back in there give it a quick wipe so yeah it's uh basically it's dual air flow as well you can this side is side it's in now you see hang on by the way the battery is 690 mah on this there's your air holes that's where your air is coming in just there and you have two sides on the pod you have one see if this will pick it up one that's big and one that's a little bit smaller so whatever side put it in corresponding with the side your air holes in and vape oh and it's five on five off so five clicks on five clicks off again you have your usb port at the bottom for charging so i said it's a total you know um this start flavor and that right i'll take that babe um lovely and if you like that also this is a good thing about this pod is it's uh fire activated so listen that's how quick you know it functions so i can fire and puff or i can just puff and it's got a sensor in it so it's puff activated there you go yeah and beautiful beautiful fight the caliber ng i have all the ones i've showed you for if you want to quit smoking get this the caliber and jig it will cost you about yeah 25 30 you know give it a while it could be cheap and like i said if you want to tie a draw you can turn the pod around and simply i'm going huh [Music] and like all the others i've showed you the coil keeps up good coils caliber and you know that's by you well as well the ul caliber and g were easy to do is probably the best the best pod mod i it's my best pod mod of 20 20 yeah 21 could be something better but i don't know so that's it i've explained to you and uh i'm gonna do another follow-on video and uh it's gonna be i'm gonna have a drop of tea if you don't mind um excuse me yes i was lucky my vaping journey i'm gonna show you some little teaser for the next video this is called you probably don't know what you've heard of squonk and this is squonk bottles i'm gonna give you a little hint for my next review a squonk bottle this i'm gonna show you is a squonk mod is to vandy value pulse x and i have the profile mesh rda you see these this is more where it comes into the hobbyist side i have what have i got here yeah i have a thing of what tofo these are coils you can build your own coils with if you get a tool kit a core building jig but my next video is going to be on building you know and you're going to need coils cotton scissors screwdrivers snippers pliers a whole plethora of things but i i i love it i i'm a hobbyist fiber and i love it you know i was uh i was addicted to alcohol i was addicted to other things and my journey like vaping has just really really helped it so i hope you you'd like this video and learn a bit from it i'm just gonna have a puff this is one of my favorite setups the vandy vape this is a squonker right i'm gonna tell you more about squonking right so it's a weird old number the next time after profile uh rdi on it and there's my squonk bottle there you can see pulse x i'm gonna have a toke on this and i'm gonna leave it at that one of my favourite little mods now you can see this this is where it gets you know

cigarettes would be like i said seven years vibing and my chest has never been better you know 95 harm reduction one more time and i'm out of it but i really hope you watch my next video i'm going to go into squonking batteries and rebuildables rdi's rtis explain to us what it all means but i'm gonna do a build as well so join me on my next video this is joe the village vapor out so like and subscribe if you want please be doing me a great favor you know it might really make my day i hope you've enjoyed the video yeah right that's me out see you vipers have a good one", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "QClNoHWQ0GE": "Hello and welcome to VapeFuse. In this video\nwe are going to review the CCELL Silo 510 thread oil cartridge vaporizer. The Silo is beautifully designed and available\nin multiple colors. It comes with a 500mAh battery and it\u2019s\nslightly taller and wider than the CCEll Palm. In the box you'll find the Silo battery, a\nshort USB charging cable, two magnetic adapters, a warranty card and a single page user's guide. A single page only, as it is really simple\nto use. Let me walk you through it. It is recommended to put it on the charger\nbefore the first use to make sure the battery is conditioned. Once your battery is fully charged, screw\non a magnetic metal adapter to a cartridge and slide it into the device. Make sure you are using a good quality oil\ncartridge as it will have a huge effect on your vaping experience. The CCell TH2 Oil Cartridges for example work\nperfectly with the Silo. You don't need to turn anything on or press\nany buttons. The Silo has an auto inhale function, so all\nyou have to do is take your draw and enjoy the vapor. If you like to run your vapor through water,\nyou can use a Dab Cap adapter to make that process very simple. Let us know in the comments section below\nif you have any questions. You'll find links to everything I mentioned\nin the description below and don't forget to like and subscribe", "Jd1MxfFfJO4": "[Music] [Applause] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is a battery video not a battery like review video but more like a video discussing a very important topic when it comes to cartridges and batteries and it is do batteries really matter when it comes to cartridges like should you get the branded cartridge battery along with the branded cartridge you know a lot of companies obviously they're gonna have their own branded you know battery so it can match their cartridge it makes it all look nice and pristine and match and all that good stuff but does it really matter you know most companies I'm not gonna name any because most of them do it they just buy from like China like a source and then they imprint their own branding on the battery itself most of them are very generic batteries at one point everyone was using that button list little like pencil one with the stylus at the end now they can switched on to like a more box [ __ ] or they have a cylinder [ __ ] but I just want to explain like does it really matter and also proprietary batteries a lot of people are getting mixed up about what a proprietary battery is there's two different types of batteries when it comes to you know cartridges and stuff at least in my opinion I think there's Universal batteries which are 510 threading most of the time and then there are proprietary batteries which are batteries that you would have to buy to use with that specific pod cartridge thingamajig you know I'm saying so give me some examples right I got four batteries one with actually a raw card and share that's wrong aren't you know I'm saying raw garden cartridge on it but we're gonna explain the batteries here so we're gonna start off with a regular 510 battery but I would say that this is like a hybrid proprietary battery because you do need adapter which you know not a lot of people have this is not one it doesn't you've been here I've somehow misplaced is so but if you do have them in a magnetic piece you can actually use it on other like cartridges you don't have to use it on the arrow arrow Pro pen cartridge but it does look nice with it has the micro USB and actually vibrates when you hit it that way you don't really need to look at the light indicator to see if you're actually hitting it which is pretty cool you know and then we got I would say a proprietary battery yes you know saying we got the plug-and-play you know only thing that works with this battery are plug and play cards right unless you can find something else I do know that the plug employee I think they copied the design of vape pen cartridge no I'm saying I forgot what it was but yes be fire or some [ __ ] like that something weird okay and then we got a universal battery you know I'm saying this is the - babe I will post the link in the bottom description below nice little but this is a 510 threading battery you can see it's the non mehnat non-magnetic one right here so you just screw it on I feel like a lot of batteries are switching on to the magnetic way because this tends to like [ __ ] up your your cartridge I wouldn't say all the time but at one point like I would have left the cartridge on this and then not on this but like another twist on thing and then oil actually seek down and it actually stuck to each other so you got to avoid that but I haven't had problems with this dads vape very very nice stuff and if you could even put the cartridge let me just show you how how Universal just really is so just yeah I wanna be on the lookout for another dad's big battery review I just got one in white gonna be doing it pretty soon within the next few days but so you're here preheating as well so it's good to buy these Universal batteries you know another thing about voltage settings like most companies have their set specific voltage setting and I think some companies even hardwire their batteries to work better with their [ __ ] which I could see you know some companies doing and I feel it you know why not have a battery that works specifically for your oil even if it's like a 510 threading Universal battery but generally doesn't really matter just start with the lowest voltage you know the lowest you can get minus 2.8 where's the battery has to is the lowest so you know everyone's just gonna have different things boys so yeah 510 threading all that good stuff very very good stuff oh I didn't show you this so you could actually hit it like this too maybe even much more discreet I'm saying like all batteries are gonna have different functionalities you know then it's just gonna be on what you prefer so let me just like this so this is actually like a universal third-party battery like Danis weight makes batteries for cartridges they don't make their own cartridges or fill them up or anything just like the pocket all these other batteries that you can buy that actually are just batteries made for cartridges you know if you want to invest in something if you see yourself as a cartridge guy you know I would definitely recommend buying like a third party battery you know cuz they just work a lot better than these company ones they have a lot more features and yeah unless you're getting pods and stuff then you're gonna have to settle for you know this or its dizzy battery you know but when it comes to cartridges which you know is the main Universal way of you know pods aren't really like as popular as cartridges note saying just because there's not too much on the market you know there's only a 1/8 a select few that you could probably name in one hand so with that I'm going to take another hit but this time though I didn't explain this but this battery so if you guys have been seeing this lately on my channel I've been using this the most but this is the chill battery and this was made for a distillate pen a few months back I did a video on it the cartridge actually came with this battery and it worked great with it you know I'm saying but it also works great with this wall garden and the point of this video is like you don't really need to spend $15 for a battery it's but like when it's when it's like a 5/10 rate obviously but if you plot a slugging play you're gonna have to buy this that's what I'm saying but you don't have to spend $15 extra if you have one of these batteries laying around start with the lowest setting and work your way up because that's how you should do it you know with that I'm gonna take another hit and we're probably gonna end the video here I'm gonna drink some of this milk well quick yeah I know it's the morning I don't I switched up from tea and milk maybe some milk tea in the future who knows no exam let's cheers guys who so there you have it guys that is going to be it for this video hopefully you guys enjoyed it let me know in the comments do you care about batteries that much or do you just pick up the battery that's closest to you and use it with a cartridge just like that you know because at the end of the day most of these mother [ __ ] aren't universal you know except the pods so most of them should work unless they have some like weird like you know physical like blocking [ __ ] on there you know then yeah it won't work like this you know you can't really put a cartridge in there without this but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music]", "7m53NS7xYRo": "they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n in gradients as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys tony robb here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're up in my car and we're about to review the wiz khalifa og by pure1 and just thinking about it i could have done this in my room because like vape cartridges don't smell that much but before i start this video i just want to give you guys a little disclaimer to watch out for fake cartridges when i looked up the pure one wiz khalifa og i had seen that there's a lot of people out there that had been scammed with fake cartridges so when buying a [ __ ] cartridge buy it from a reputable source and just don't buy it from somebody who's super [ __ ] shady so please watch out and with that out of the way if you guys want to see more vape cartridge videos drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below and without further ado let's get this video started whoop all right guys we got the pure one wiz khalifa oh g over here which is a indica strain i got 1 000 milligrams which is equivalent to 1 grams of concentrate and i bought this from a reputable source so i don't want you guys saying in the comments down below that this is a fake cartridge and just looking at the packaging the package is very beautiful you know with that gold tint on the side um with the warning label on the back which i will be reading for you guys on the back of this package it says wiz khalifa og the best hitting ceramic cartridge disposable cartridge 1 000 milligrams it says ingredients and i just want to [ __ ] point out which kind of scares me you know because i just said that this isn't a fake card they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n ingredients whatever in the ingredients it says cannabis oil natural terpenes all right instructions for use screw the cartridge onto the battery to ensure the best vaping we strongly recommend the pure one battery blah blah blah that's just advertising obviously for the brand inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat they're not saying how many times you should inhale and exhale repeat but i'm assuming like three to four times should get you gently or modestly baked um if you want to take it to a whole other level obviously you're gonna spam the [ __ ] cartridge up until you can't feel your brain but i would not necessarily recommend that as a natural product the color of the oil may have a slight variation without sacrificing quality prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat will cause the cartridge to leak now the government warning this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which is not the case in canada because it is 100 percent legal keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours i have never taken a cartridge where the delay is two hours it is generally like two minutes right like very rarely no actually it is i think impossible to smoke a joint or hit a cart and the effects hit you in two hours it's not inedible right cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery please use extreme caution and then there's the final warning which is not the government warning this product can expose you to chemicals including pulagon which is known in the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm for more information go to www.whatever blah blah blah blah and then you have like the purevape website and purevape instagram with that out of the way we're gonna open up the box over here and i don't want to destroy it right because it is a very beautiful box so i'm just assuming you either push it up ah yeah wow a beautiful push feature wow and i could keep this because this is actually a beautiful packaging so i'm gonna put that on the side and now we got the pure vape cartridge wow the color of it looks amazing like it's not too clear right but it's not too brown it's a right in between color we got one full gram but we got it over here and this is what it looks like it is kind of transparent if you put it up in the sunlight honestly and the color isn't too dark right it's not the darkest i've seen but it's not the lightest color and it is obviously not the same color as the packaging as they said on the back the color may be different blah blah blah blah blah we got the vape cartridge turned on now and i will be putting it oh i turned it off oh [ __ ] i will be putting it on the lowest setting and going to medium and then going to high and i will be telling you guys like what best setting to hit it because there's different types of vape cartridges where if you hit it on a high setting it just burns completely the car other vape cartridges if you hit it on the low setting it just does not hit and sometimes you know the middle setting just doesn't work so you got to try it out all right i'm on the blue setting which is the lowest setting and we're just going to follow the instructions that are on the package so for best use inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat so like i was saying i'm gonna inhale for three seconds exhale repeat three times for each temperature setting and then i'll be able to judge which setting is the best and tell you guys if it actually tastes good and then finally i'll take [ __ ] blinker because i know everybody wants me to take [ __ ] blinkers right but now the moment that you guys have been waiting for let's take the first three second puff so let's get it guys cheers what the [ __ ] [Music] why did that taste like dry pasta that wasn't the taste i was expecting what the [ __ ] like it literally caught me by surprise bro like i was expecting some sort of like stronger taste because it is like an indica and i was expecting like something you know a little fruity because like you know wiz khalifa og kind of a tropical fruity taste you know but no it tastes like dried [ __ ] pasta but i'll be taking another puff because like i said we're gonna repeat three times on each temperature setting so without further ado let's get it cheers guys okay on that second puff a little bit more fruity maybe needed a little bit time to you know heat up and activate um there's not much of that like you know tingling sense in the back of your ears and like inside of your eyeballs when you're hitting a cart there's not much of that to be honest with that second puff there's like a mix of like dried pasta and like fruity taste so i'll be taking the third and final puff on the lowest temperature setting so cheers guys well i'm just gonna be 100 honest after three rounds on the low temperature it did start to kick for me right i feel as if this was like a productive type of indica buzz because it's not really a body buzz it's not gonna like slouch you it's not gonna get you tired it's kind of like one of those productive ass buzzes in my opinion that's how it's feeling right but we will keep going up with the temperatures but we're on the [ __ ] red setting so that's the medium setting so let's see what the medium heat see if this shit's gonna start smacking and yeah let's get it guys cheers nice three second hit and wow okay the taste is way smoother so with a low temperature low setting it tastes like [ __ ] dry pasta with this it's just a fruity taste to it honestly it's maybe because the combustion is a little quicker but yeah i'm going to take the second puff on this one because it was super not harsh so cheers guys [Music] them three second puffs are very blessed [Music] overall this [ __ ] started to hit man you know the indica feeling is starting to creep up slowly maturely upon me right and i did get a full night of sleep so i'm not tired in that sense alright we will take the third and final puff of the medium setting let's get it guys cheers got that one all right so just overall the key difference with the medium setting is that the hit is a little smoother and it tastes a lot less like [ __ ] ala dente spaghetti you know what i mean so we're going to be moving on to the final heating temperature with the which is the highest temperature of the battery so we're going to be taking the three puffs off of this if there's a key difference or there's something to add i'll add it or else it's gonna be like some sort of i don't know three puff montage or whatever but let's get it guys cheers okay yeah i do have something to add with the high temp you can really taste the full amount the full flavor you know what i mean which is pretty sick so medium and high is better for for this strain there's like i said some other strains they prefer i guess low temperature to hit better but with the wuz khalifa og is tasting pretty pretty good so we'll take the second puff cheers guys nothing to add on that second puff so we'll go directly to the third one cheers just overall nine puffs in it really fries you like nine puffs in i was expecting to be a little slumped like a little you know all right guys this is future robin and i'm currently doing the outro because i just checked my computer checked the gopro and i just cannot find the rest of the video like for some reason it's just completely deleted maybe it got corrupted i don't know but i will be taking the blinker because obviously i promised you guys a blinker so i'm not gonna beat around the bush too much cheers guys alright this is like post post editing rob and i just gotta say that like i did hit a blinker i tried my absolute best to put my finger in a certain type of way where the camera would capture the actual blinking but like my dumbass kept my finger in front of the light so it did not appear in the video so you guys gotta take my word for it that i actually did hit a blinker and like i wouldn't be coughing uncontrollably and not being able to hold on the hit if i didn't take a blinker trust me on that take my word for it this is like post post editing rob i'm like on some omnipresent [ __ ] yeah okay i think i'm gonna leave now but god damn like i was saying the strain is very very like uplifting and it's not like a super indica for some reason like this train doesn't get you couch locked it doesn't give you that natural indica feeling it really uplifts you and it kind of gives you a boost of energy like i just took a blinker and i'm feeling up and at it right and i've been awake for like five six hours but besides the fact that the word ingredients is misspelled i really didn't join this cart and i do hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like please and hit that subscribe button if you haven't already check out all my social media links are in description down below this is tony robb you guys know the drill um out", "mUScyUxK2Wg": "all right so right here we got the C cell palm and I'm using one of these cell cartridges one of the things I do like about this of course it's magnet Bank it's pretty strong has a little bit of a different magnet connector I've noticed in some of the other vapes this is a Nani button push this is a pull drop straw and it goes I guess way background a little bit hard to see but it does deliver very good hit it matches well with the with their own cartridge this is the half RAM and it's pretty discreet and you can just look around on this side you can see what's there probably like these and I'll be using this for a while graceland fits in the pocket nice and standard micro USB there you go thanks for visiting", "LyvpXsqj1vA": "[Music] hi mark here with Hamilton devices today I'm going to show you our C cell palm battery okay we slide this cover off here right top here this is a little instruction sheet I'll go with that in a moment and inside you'll see the contents of the box the the battery itself the cartridge adapters and the charger okay I'm gonna slide these guys out I'm gonna take all this little contents out here that the micro USB charger that's included and then I'm just going to take one of these little rings here that will be screen into the cartridge so if I can get this guy off of course okay there we go that's it this guy sighs okay first standard micro USB charger will plug on the bottom of the device here just plug this guy in any standard micro USB adapter at home will work just fine generally speaking it takes approximately an hour to fully charge the battery okay now I'm going back to the instruction sheet here and this is going to talk about the little adapter for the cartridge and then how do you slide it in here okay I'm gonna set this aside now the tom works with either a full gram or a half gram cartridge generalist being 90 percent class of all the cartridges in the market we work just fine with a palm device one thing we do not have to worry about the palm with some other batteries is that it doesn't matter how tall the mouthpiece is okay so I'm gonna screw this guy on right here bottom of the cartridge and then back here we're just going to slide this guy in its gonna slide it in little magnetic ring will snap in there some cartridges that may have an extra thick decorative ring may not fit in there but if it does have a tall fluted mouthpiece of work just fine nopal okay the palm battery is an auto draw battery there is no honor off buttons no buttons to push you simply inhale to activate it here we go this sim please inhale and exhale oh if you want to ever take your cartridge out you simply just pull your cartridge out that's all you have to do what we do want you always remember Corsos when you are switching cartridges make sure you take that little magnetic off a lot of folks do you forget that over sometimes we do include an to a second one there in case you have to lose it but hopefully you'll be aware of where that little ring is at all right so just go ahead put this guy back on put this aside the palm comes in six different colors pink black red blue gray in a electroplating gold if you have any questions please feel free to contact us directly or all of our information is our website you can be we can be reached at www.cannainsider.com/itunes", "6MO-ZGV-BUM": "i'm like yo there's some pink puffy [ __ ] i mean hello kitty posters and [Music] chocolates [Music] all right guys what is up simplistic here back with another video i am at ben's house once again and uh if you've been seeing this tronium battery around it's because it's been dope but they also gave me a box one too so i'm gonna see what this is and then i'm gonna probably give this little small one to ben and then i'm saying the small hand for the band no i'm just kidding um but yes this is the box battery it's like a box mod type [ __ ] and uh they're kind enough to send me one so let's see how this works oh yeah shout out to the mahomey van for always being dope you know saying but this is what it looks like uh the back draw activation so there's no button 380 milliamp per hour battery micro usb compatible with troy pods which is the the cartridges the empty cartridges that they provide one year warranty so there you go right off the bat very very nice um [Music] i was about to say that's it it's supposed to there's a quick start manual [Applause] micro usb adapter which they offer for the the small one and the long ones so this one you use for full grain this one for a half gram manual also a qr code if you want to scan it well let's just get into it we got that nine dollar half grand papa herbs look how much i have left because i went live again last night shout out to the people you know what i'm saying oh nice so it's auto hit so how do you turn this on and off it's weird oh it hits it's actually a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be oh wow definitely start the day with this there's no button just hit it there's no indication here that's pretty cool like you like it has these like uh where you can see the oil yeah yeah you just you just hit it it's actually really smooth compared to the other battery this one there's no voltage setting though so uh it kind of just maybe it's like a smart battery i don't [ __ ] know maybe i adjust to the the cartridge how smooth is it is it cool i like i like the way it feels too how it's like uh it's got like this little the form factor right and that's his thumb yes yeah also um like i said the drawback with these ones how'd you like it it's cool so these are basically the drawback of having a stick battery is that if you put in your pocket it could break you know what i'm saying if you sit down if you just like put in here you know sometimes you just put a pencil in your pocket and sit around with it you know some tight pants or some [ __ ] you know so it does happen um micro usb on the bottom uh i thought it would be usbc by now but you know i'm saying you can't really go wrong with micro usb it still charges pretty fast 380 milliamp per hour battery um other than that i'm taking more uh like a few more hits with this uh i'm enjoying it um maybe i should take a hit alongside with this one to see how smooth it is compared but is there any light that indicates like it's i think it's right here can you see no no light there's no manual there is many oh what the [ __ ] what it's right here see if you can see the light oh yeah okay so the light is right here so you can so like i said uh they did send me two batteries the stick battery and the pocket battery and honestly i'm i'm digging this one uh the light is i mean it's kind of visible in the in sunlight but overall really really good experience and i'm saying it's basically the height of this one still you know i'm saying so but check them out i'll post everything in the comments below you know i'm saying i'll pin a comment because i've been getting you know deleted because i've been posting links and strikes and stuff so i'd rather just post it in the comments you'll that's where you'll find it but definitely a good battery from um i'm saying other otherwise known as t-vape as well so thank you for watching the video see you guys the next one [Music] he [Music]", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "M6raoDxGlf0": "well what do we have here looks like 50 bucks to some people that's not a lot of money but for me i'll take it every time [Applause] so for anybody who didn't already know a couple of weeks ago i installed a chirai battery on my scooter but then i started thinking what if i need to charge this sucker and even though it says it on the box here that you can use a standard lead acid battery charger i figured i didn't want to change that but after looking up the proprietary shirai charging system and seeing a price tag of around 85 i started to have second thoughts see i was already in the hole 120 for the battery so to put 85 on top of that that's getting to be a little bit too expensive so i went on good old amazon and started looking up alternative battery chargers for lithium batteries and folks i came across this yep fox sir does it again and you guys know how much i love my fox saw lead acid battery charger but again i was not willing to trust this thing on that very expensive battery so for 35 dollars i was able to pick up this bad boy now i'm not going to go into too much detail because it's very much like the old unit you have your mode button here to toggle through your choices but if you look here your choices have changed not only can it do lithium and when i say lithium these are lithium batteries that have a bms installed on it and we'll get all into that in another video but as you can see it also does lead acid batteries along with gel and all the other type of batteries that the old one did and then we have the one that should rise under which is the lipo battery and then very much like the old unit a repair module now this one's a little bit different in the fact that it'll charge 12 volts at 6 amps and 24 volts at 3 amps i'm going to let you know right now it will charge the lipo battery at 1.5 amps where the surai charger charges it at 2 amps earlier i was able to test this charger on my chirai battery and it came through like a champ so folks that's where the 50 comes in we can either go with the proprietary 85 dollar charger that will only charge one type of battery or for 35 dollars you can open up your options a little bit as always i'll provide a link in the description for this item this is your boy kacchi's kid i'll see you all in the next one peace out", "1khJYBX3n6s": "all right I'm here to introduce you to the doogal the world's first dual five Spanish red bait car containing batteries it uses two magnetic waves to attach the bottom of any 510 thread cartridge that you can find in any market should they drop the cartridges in there's no button I don't know forgiving really big rips because his two partners after all we also sell this case as an accessory it holds six cartridges inside so you can pick and choose and mix and match any bait pairs that you love this paste is so small it can fit in your back pocket it's like carrying a vape mini bar around in your back pocket even small enough to fit inside the smell proof case that we sell in our online store there's even room to hold the battery inside and empower you the battery charges up in less than an hour and we hear a tank phone I really believe that two is better than one and we just want a chance to be able to prove it to you all thankfully do boys check us out", "tEsMD-d72_g": "hmm so hopefully this is centered guys but what's going on YouTube today guys I just wanted to make a quick little video because honestly it's been a long day so I'm not really like in the spirits to make a video but I do want to make a video you know I want to have a video made for you guys tomorrow because I've been keeping it consistent so this is my attempt to making a video on a lazy day well even though it's been productive so into the introduction to the video topic today guys I'll be showing you guys my favorite baddie battery baddie for short [ __ ] and then we're gonna be show it we're gonna be going into higher def of the Alpine live resin cartridges we're gonna be hitting both the gorilla glue number 4 and the true OG it's just gonna be a chill sesh imma be telling you guys what I like about these products and why I choose the stick it was battery over other batteries because as you guys know I have had the opportunity to try so many batteries as of late and they've been great there's been a lot of great ones there's been a lot of bad ones so I want to tell you guys why I choose this one over the other ones that I've tried so far so since it is already gonna be night time I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with the indica first I shot my head with the hybrid first gorilla glue number four and then we're gonna go straight into the true orgy right after we're gonna had a piece of lint in my freaking mouth so right here guys you got the girl the glue number four not sure if that's focused in or not but gorilla glue number four and got the battery fully charged dude so go ahead and screw that on here and man it's kind of hot it's it's spring time already yeah like I think it officially hit spring and it's starting to get hot the worm is starting to kick in man and it's finally not cold which is cool you know even though I enjoyed the cold I definitely didn't enjoy the days that it was so so freezing to the point where I had to be covered in two blankets but if you guys are 18 you know where 21 over make sure you guys are hitting this along with me let me know what you guys are hitting in the comments below man it has been a long day my mind it's kind of like scattered right now like I said I didn't I wasn't going to make a video but here I am for you guys the dedication and consistency so whose battery my resident Alpine gorilla glue number four cheers boys ooh there's so amazing about Alpine vapora has to have by far the best gorilla glue number four in the world dude they nail it to the point to the point and for sure so when taking another hit and then I'm probably gonna [ __ ] do you know I'm probably gonna just turn the air on for a little bit oh sure I just cracked the window it is a beautiful little day-out pledge crack the window a little bit this one too and we're gonna take another hit and I'm gonna tell you guys why I like this battery more than any other battery that I've tried so far so I'm actually packing it closes because there's people playing music and I don't want their music to overlap mine so just gonna have to stick with the air on us can barely hear anyways man that is amazing right already starting to sweat man these summer days these spring and summer days are so amazing it's definitely one of my favorite seasons to smoke in by far I do not enjoy any other season than summer scene the smoking like just being able to enjoy smoking at any place like outside especially dude that was the biggest hurt of the winter and the cold season I was not being able to smoke outside so onto the importance of this battery man so this battery it costed me I think 15 bucks I bought this myself this isn't sponsored at all by use this was a hundred percent me I went to go buy to smoke shop when I was waiting on some other batteries survive and they didn't arrive on time and I had some product knowledge like you know what I dude I'm just even go out and buy a battery because I want to hurry up and try this so I never go into my local smoke shop and they had this battery and it really stood out because I have seen I had seen him around but I thought they were just cheapy batteries and then honestly this was this was the best quality one at that smoke shop and then I was like you know whatever just give it to me give it to me 15 bucks isn't too bad so I bought it and when I opened yeah I was like I was like oh wow like it wasn't as cheap as I thought it was gonna be so I looked in like I got it looked into it and then the material is very very nice the finish is the kind of has like a matte finish they have different colors obviously I just chose the green because it was the best one that they had and one thing that I like about this the first thing that really caught my attention was the variable wattage is on the bottom the turn knob so for $15 the fact that you're getting variable wattage with a turn knob is amazing dude bad batteries out here charging literally 25 to 30 dollars for something like this and they're ugly they're fat batteries and this one is just so thin and so like clean looking and nice and it goes up um it's from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight so that's pretty nice who is you really did a good job man they have the little holes right here that you could put any cartridge on this no air flow airflow restriction will be added on so like I said man this this is a very very nice battery and this is why I like it over other ones because you could fit anyone it's stealthy light not like the other ones you know it's nice having it's nice having the other batteries that you can do cool stuff like the preheat function but when do you honestly need a pre heat engine if you're using a cartridge you should always have it upside upside no matter what or else you are already like not taking care of your cartridges because you as if you do know you're not supposed to be having them upside down because you're losing oil so girl Lagoon report amazing dude it gives you such a heavy and nice high actually not even heavy just such a nice high the the notes on it is very very piney very very like a little bit hint of citrusy but more of the piney scent and it's very amazing if you guys don't know gorilla glue number four is my favorite strain by far so we're hopping into the true OG a heavy indica right here oh gee for sure so slapping on the battery and then the for the Alpine you're supposed to be hitting them at 3.7 I'm hitting at this one a 3.8 even because that's where the little dot is that and we're going to turn off the air and then when they see what kind of how massive hits we get at this so true oh gee live resin here we go boys Cheers Oh yup I don't know about you guys but obviously every og is an OG for a reason right so but I don't know if this is just me but or if you guys can tell me but I taste in every og I taste this kind of a similarity which is weird because I've tried strains that are like have the same strain specific strain in it and it tastes different you know you can barely or you can barely even taste it so the fact that they can consistently get this flavor across although g-strings for me personally is pretty crazy but true OG definitely a heavy hitter man whoa just those little hits right there you got me free a super hit highs right off the bat it's a little bit more of a dirty or high for me I like the girl igloo number four it's perfect for me true og is definitely like yeah an indica a nighttime because I'm already feeling down luckily I'm not gonna drive after this I'm just be chillin at the skate park right now for a couple hours go to and then after that just go to Target get some waters go home get ready for work tomorrow continue the grind that continuous grind guys actually have homework to do tonight so we're gonna be doing that also so grind it all the time so cheers boys this is for the people out there working hard every day to make [ __ ] happen I got the water man stay hydrated all the time I've really been taking health until like into more of like way bigger dude way bigger I've been enjoying it a lot more I've even thought about getting into bodybuilding because I've kind of been getting bored of just going and lifting weights just to look good you know I kind of want to challenge myself and do something so I might be getting into bodybuilding I'll see what the world like how hard it is because I already have a hard lifestyle as it is so but that would be pretty fun I mean I'm six foot one six foot two whatever I don't know double check that but six foot two I currently weigh 210 and I want to be honestly at a solid 190 so but just really lean muscle so we're almost there I've definitely definitely been seeing the results like coming in and it makes me happy no consistency is key guys so we're going to take this last hit and we're gonna finish the video because I'm already faded off my ass and then so cheers boys hi I'm not gonna let it go I'm gonna talk over it so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys make sure to leave a like comment a sub don't forget to share with your friends do all that good jazz you know we keeping the positivity keeping the content coming the consistency every three days is kind of my schedule that I'm coming on right now which kind of works for me we got some big things coming up steezy big battery coming soon video moon rock coming video coming soon so imma ending here guys I'm faded I gotta go I hope you guys have an amazing day like I said again go make sure I hit that sub button if you're new here and have an amazing day lates", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "IzLl6UezmwI": "yo was poppy you too was cranky Excel today guess what got a [ __ ] review this is a review that's a vape yeah yeah yeah you know let me get I have to get over it they got all sorts of different types of colors but I want it red definitely let's unbox this beer I want it I want the black or like yeah I want the UH the all black boil or a little silver one order wouldn't tip one I was good on those yeah no ma'am anyways push it over so uh-huh get in the box you know basically is I telling you what the [ __ ] is all included oh look like almost I'm opening up bracelet or you know an Apple watch oh oh put a little fire maybe straight out the box review yeah him straight out the [ __ ] box Wow okay Wow oh my god the feel of my hand is lovely okay so as you see we got hard streets already in here but of course numbnuts can't smoke anything out of this you can't even put no oil in that it has no coils at all is just just efficient no I'm saying okay do none of that I so the reason why I bought did be is because I've seen a youtuber crunch for 20 he had in that beat a little grow so basically I got it looked at something musical I officially bought it and I'm like yeah I gotta get it um it was a little steep for this it was $100 but they got a payment plan where you could do like 28 34 for I don't like for payments who makes a pay at home for um another cool feature that I like is that there is no like you don't have that on twist [ __ ] you ain't gotta take your cart to charge it it's magnetic do straight in there like that straight magnetic I'm saying I like that I also like the fact that it has you see these little holes right there it has you know little airflow holes so when I'm taking a really deep pit I cannot get a pull through without crushing my lungs I got a cartridge right yeah I'm saying we're gonna take the bottom piece off okay and the thing about this the cartridge is so thin and not why I don't have to take the you know the airflow piece off that kind of like you know basically I would take this tip off too if there was a 5-10 cartridge so if it was like a thicker one but luckily me it was Clement this pen has three different types of settings which is low medium and high so you click one two three four five it's on one two three four five it blake's let me know that song all right tell them take a hit oh I could really taste the blueberry really okay one two three four five I mean not one two three four five times it on nothing clicking I turn it back on one two three changes the setting I want to the three chains as a setting one two three changes of setting so I'm a sole man okay so basically like I was pronounced on inside of this box are instructions on the power levels so blue ever the lowest medium is yellow you know and I have red or a little purple whatever you want to call it five times on an on-off three times the cycle power level okay what I also like about this pen is that on if I were to leave is in my pocket it wouldn't just stay on it would like you got this automatic shelf no I'm saying so I like that you know I'm saying I think that's pretty awesome yeah I think that that's dope I got a one-year warranty on it you know just in case anything goes wrong with it but yeah so if you have a cartridge that is a little bit thicker than this you would have to take this off because other than that it will not be able to go and see how easy it is to take the toys off it wouldn't be able to fit in there you would have to uncle did you know what's yeah other than that I'm already under the way you know I'm gonna hit and take a hit once a little 30 I don't want it high so one two three it's all medium one two three it's that as long as that's real love but I could taste the blueberry in this that I got I love it hey vassal I need you to put me on with some some more tea pens I'm already in love with you Thanks check me out", "Ehur9uFryow": "[Music] oh all right let's go to YouTube so back at it again with another

a little dent in it yesterday we were taking some fat Ripper Reno's for you guys so that that's why there is an air bubble there so before we get into the review man let me tell you guys I still have

tell you guys I do recommend going out and getting this one too if you guys aren't gonna buy the the pocket vapour battery to go ahead and get this one I know it I know it's just like you know no variable wattage and none of that stuff but you know it's a proprietary batter so if you're gonna be buying raw garden cartridges a lot you might as well buy prepared to everybody so go ahead and turn this air off real quick one time for the boys and hope you guys are having an amazing blessed day I know I am - man it's good it's it's been a good couple of good a couple of weeks or me tell you the truth I've been having some time off I've been having time to do things you know and I'm just I'm just happy I'm contented there's no reason to not be content and let's get to it man this thing looks so sleek it's so nice alright you kind of punched number 72 make sure you guys are smoking along with me if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over whatever it is in your legal state man only legal patients only so cheers guys let's see if we get the raw garden logo right there all right so just to touch base on the battery real quick this has literally no airflow whatsoever so when you're hitting it it feels like you're heating a clogged car as for with the pocky battery yes sir holy moly first hit of the day got me no jokes it's already noon and I still have any anything this is my first card of the day but that thing I already got me fade I'm telling you man yesterday was a good video it was a good video but it was just too dark to give it to you guys meant to wait too dark so yeah pocket vapor ultimate airflow dude ultimate [ __ ] airflow all right now now getting into the review boys so right off that initial Wow dude right off that initial hit it did the same thing to me yesterday it tastes a lot like Barry's super super super berry like it I'm for sure it has to have a cross train of purple punch in it because it's super berry super super berry like I'm talking about this the first hit the first initial hit man you're gonna get a pungent in his super mouth filling of berries bro and it's not like artificial berries to it's like you know aftertaste after you drink like after you eat a grape in shading you got the aftertaste of like a grape it's kind of similar man so the taste is [ __ ] phenomenal off this it doesn't really have too much of a cushy vibe to it or too much of like a you know a tree game going but we're gonna hit it maybe we could get something out of it but before we do let's go ahead and switch it onto the king itself the pocket labor battery mint you get the ultimate airflow a nice ass temperature you know get the most out of your cartridge man you guys should be getting up a battery like this how you guys shoot because it makes your experience so much more enjoyable man I know got dry lips excuse that guys all right pocket vapor in now so I think off of this one we're gonna be hitting it off the orange setting I think is or in your setting so I think this is like the middle the middle setting so let's see what let's see how it goes boys just listen I don't know if you guys can listen to this I'm gonna try to get as close as possible but try to listen to the airflow I try to listen to the airflow Oh holy [ __ ] no joke that clapped me that got me boys that got you bought whoa all right that's it that [ __ ] smacked me for sure not gonna be using that setting that's the setting that you put when you want to kill somebody dude seriously are you looking to just get super faded and that wasn't even the hottest setting dude the hottest setting is red I'm about to show you guys one time man I'm about to show you guys one time all right not just let me talk over it so that hey right there you guys heard the maximum airflow right maximum airflow is so [ __ ] nice on a cartridge man like when you're hitting something on a restricted cart like battery it's so horrible man because it's you're literally not getting enough airflow so you're burning up the coil at first of all slowly but surely you're burning up so that's why you get like a weird taste - you're not getting like a super you know fruity taste or whatever your cartridge is supposed to be tasting like it's probably the airflow man you're probably burning up the coil you know and it's just gunking up in there so I do recommend going out and buy this man you already know the deal and if you don't want to buy it man you could be one of the lucky one one person one person is going to be winning one of these right here this color right here right now so I'm gonna be doing a giveaway by the time you guys see this video go ahead and click on my Instagram and go follow my Instagram and pocky vapor and my gaming team prophecy gaming so I'll put all three of those accounts down below and we will be choosing one person win right and we will be giving them away a shirt also so make sure to do that man and tag your friends tag your friends and more people the better and you the more people you tag the better the higher your chances are of winning all right so let's go ahead and hit this on the red setting man cuz that hit was so good so freakin good it tasted so pungent you got me like smacked they literally smacked me right in my face I still know tree like you know no earthy earthy taste to it so this is more likely on the fruitier side of raw garden mmm cheers boys whoo oh my gosh that red setting is amazing oh yes sir oh that thing claps oh you guys need to go buy this right now you guys heard it here first if you're smoking cartridges and you guys don't have this battery you're [ __ ] up oh my gosh that was amazing I'm nyan cat that was amazing this cartridge is sitting literally all right remember to use this this thing is sitting at 80 percent THC right 80 percent total cannabinoids and and all right so let me just do a little let me show you yes and then that last raw garden cartridge that I got was at a 90 right dojo cush it was super amazing so super super smacked but I was getting most of the feeling because it was a cush strain right so that means that this this right here this has absolutely no cush at all in it it's just a bunch of fruity strains that they had that rubber and made up and it's smacking me just as hard if not harder as the dojo cush so it's sitting that at 80 percent THC so doo doo TC percentages really matter is what I'm trying to get at do they really matter or is it what strains they mix it with because tell you the truth I've had [ __ ] 93 percent cartridges and they don't they don't do [ __ ] like I'm dead serious they don't do anything for me so and I've noticed that a lot of lower end TC percentage cartridges smack me like a little like boom like I'm having a session I'm just like out after like 2 to 3 hits so raw garden you're doing phenomenal job with this frickin ucae punch like they're doing such great jobs I know this week they release a lot more flavor so by the time you guys see this I want you guys to hit that notification bill hit that subscribe button because we if you got especially if you smell Kroger mmm because we're gonna be keeping you updated with the weekly flavors and which one you should be getting so let's get it boys I'm gonna take another one on rent and go ahead and end the video out here actually I'll probably take it on the lowest setting that way you guys can see the clouds on that and end it out here and then give you guys the full review on this and get to the movement you know so cheers boys if you guys are 18 over 21 over you already know the deal like I said earlier alright that was a low setting but as you guys could see there and switch to the rainbow colors right it switched to the freakin rainbow colors and that I think from when I remember is like sesh mode and he keeps going after like more than ten seconds that one was super light super light in clouds but the taste oh we super tippy yo I'm telling you guys

money off of your pockets too so let's get it boys I hope let's get into the final review of the raw garden cartridge tell us is true this thing smacks your auger and definitely knows what they're doing I feel like what they're trying to do in order it like yeah they always release new strains but I feel like what they're trying to do they're trying to create a vault of like super specific streams that they like that are super like you know fan favorites and they're gonna be keeping those in the history of lineage of like seeds and stuff like that but you've got punch number 72 is a banger dude it's super berry no it's very very like note honestly no tones of earthiness at all it's more on the berry sweeter side but if you guys have been using raw garden you guys know what kind of like sweetness it is it's not fake it's super super nice like something you would get off of a flower and the hymen the highest phenomenal I would give it an 8 out of 10 tell you the truth like the only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 is because I since I have such a high tolerance I feel like it's not hitting me in a full effect but and then also an indica is usually super super cash luck but this one I'm like I'm relaxed I'm relaxed but I feel like I can still function which is good you know I'm not really hating on that so overall quality I'll probably give this a 10 out of 10 I'm 9 out of 10 Man 9 out of 10 it could use a little work like I said on the indica putting you a little bit more to sleep but overall man the quality raw garden never fails so if you guys are legal and illegal stay somewhere where you can get regardin years no you guys should hit them up see where you can find it legally so we're gonna end the video here if you guys enjoyed today's video man like I did go ahead and leave a sub it helps way more than you think and smash that [ __ ] like button and leave a comment I like to interact with everybody tell you guys the truth ie I interact with everybody so yeah let's keep it going boys and we'll catch you guys later", "evWCqaf4EX4": "hello my name is Kip and I'm the account executive for Northern California and Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks

everyone's been asking so I'm gonna start making a video where I'm taking apart one of these pens so I've never taken apart this kind before well I got is two pliers here I'm just gonna grip one here grab it by the tip I'm gonna have to use the other ones for it this is kind of what I did last time and I did just kind of might be crushing this one though nope there she goes let's see if I can get the other end off I don't even know I think I did this last time I don't think I need to get this end off let's get it off anyway if it comes off I think this would be the end with all the electronics yo luck I came right out so I had another one before but I could not get the damn thing out and I remember I was struggling hard this one came apart pretty easy okay so now I'm gonna take some outs here to poke it out hopefully there you go this one came out easy nice perfect so there you go and now this has probably made the exact same way yeah this is a little different wouldn't be sure it looks like this cap can come off over here so you can't just no no these one's a little different like this one's even different from the last video there I'm gonna worry about this that's just the battery rip that off I bet I can get that off look I'm close you'll usually see like ridges yeah I don't know if this is gonna focus properly yeah there's like a little Ridge on the top usually look for that kind of thing that was like the ridge on the end of here when you're taking that off same kind of thing it's gonna take a look at your unit and see where you need to grab onto like I gotta keep grabbing onto the tips here so it's really good to have a good pair of linesman pliers there you go there's the wek and everything she's toast and I'm sure I can just dig that out if I were to get something I could probably just dig that little guy oh but actually you know what doing this backwards because I think this here on this end oh yeah okay there you go that's there you go that little rubber nipple in there and that'll that'll be where my uh now this stuff I'm not gonna smoke this stuff cuz I jumped in a river with this one this is river water basically yeah Rasen there anyway there you go so I bet it would be a little harder to get that out if it wasn't so liquidy I'm sure you can figure out a way like stick a pin in there dip it in there I don't know you'll you'll figure out a way and if you have to I bet like this plastics kind of flimsy enough I bet you can find a way to kind of find an exacto blade and if you were careful enough you know not to cut yourself you could probably put it down and cut through it or even figure out a way to get in there and eventually you can get your oil this one's plastic I'm not sure how other ones are but there you go thanks for watching", "HPKNK7N_qS8": "hello DJ highway 9 paper here hey listen I just got a real good tip here maybe had this problem a while ago and I was like this would be good for me to pass on just in case this happens of people okay say you're vaping right and your battery starts to blink and you're like oh my god what's going on alright you go to hit it it's just bring first thing you do take your tank off okay push your button if it stays solid then you know pretty much it's probably your core but if you take your tank off and it's still blinking then you know my battery is about died I better charge it up so you got your tank on there vaping away everything's fine next he knows like my better kids blinking what's going on so take your tank off first make sure push your button ah it's solid so I know it's probably my course next step would be and this goes the same with sub tanks really because they both do kind of the same thing when it's either your battery or your coil I put the sub tanks with these regulated mods you usually tell your battery like change your battery or something okay but these right here you really have no warning other than a blinking light or some of these batteries change colors but regular bathing batteries probably just blink on you so that's why I'm saying this right so your battery is blinking you take your tank off if you put your button it's still solid next step now would be let's check for coil so you take your coil out first off make sure it's nice and tightly if it is then you know what goes bad I need to change out my core all right if you take your battery off and say it looks like this like what what's going on oh so that was my problem my coil was just sitting inside of my tank when it needs to go right here so screw it back on if it's out make sure it's nice and snug in there put it back on your tank all right now we just get our battery and if we push it and it still blinks we know it's our coil if you push it down and stay solid get out out my point was just loose so your battery's blinking first off take your tank off make sure your batteries not dead dead because some batteries won't give you no warning but a blink America but if you take your tank off and it's still blinking you know your battery's dead charge it up if you take it off and stay solid you know it's your call so that's just a quick tip help you kind of and down the road you learn this stuff but I'm just kind of helping you out ahead just kind of little tips you don't get aggravated vaping and usually it's not the product it's most of the time just the user a lot of people just don't know no better so I try to throw out these little tips just to help you along your way ever got any questions give us a call here at I went on paper a ball", "U0mo0DbH8KE": "hello buddy and tell us community if you got your boat laid up here's a quick tip for you to make sure that your battery stays fresh and ready for you for the next season if you watched my last video you see that i installed this power port that goes directly to the battery it's always hot what this has done is allowed me to install a float trickle charger i bought this this uh shoemaker unit and it keeps a charge on that battery all winter long batteries love to stay charged with a float they don't like to be left alone they they'll go bad quickly if you do not maintain them through the off-season hey if you like my videos please give me a thumbs up hit that subscribe button please help me get to a thousand subscribers you", "9x95J3ljQ54": "hey guys this is a super quick tutorial on how to rectify the center pin issue with ego type batteries now what happens is this little bit here this pillar that's what makes connection to this in the middle of the cart or your attic whatever now when you use different sized car toes and outies you will end up screwing down woodenly needs go off and see that's actually connected and if you can hear that that's firing but oftentimes will just get screwed down one you mean - so when you unscrew your center pins actually push down a little in the middle so that bit gets crushed the arty has free movement up and down the little bit in there so sorry about the background noise that's just my daughter doing some cooking you can't cheat at any if you saw the way I did that you just tease it up litchi I'm just using a little Christmas cracker screwdriver poke it in one side give it a little left poking yeah we're giving it a little lift to make it even welcome to the learning book there we go so that should just once again fire absolutely find so literally it's just the case of popping that little center pin just sliding it up and you just gotta be a little bit careful because apparently you can break the connection so if you can tease the center pin up from a bratty you're using apparently it's best to try and do it on that first personally I find it quite hard to do on these ones so I usually just end up a little bit up on here so there you go if you have any problems anything just isn't firing but other stuff is working you got any go type connector or center pin arrangement then it's most likely that all right good luck have a good one knows", "ajCmAbusdHw": "hey guys what's up its Keith Ville here with the CVD stored comm so what I want to show you today is how to take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape oil that is on the site that's in 12

the studio with a very special video for you today today we have the top five vaporizers of 2020 perfect to start your year off with a bang or I guess a fast heat up time but first if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go screw up and your way through this video please throw us a like before you bounce without further ado let's get into it coming in at number five the utility at 7:21 brings the heat without breaking the bank awarded best vaporizer at Oak cannabis 20:19 the world's most affordable convection vaporizer features a large stainless steel heating chamber 60 minutes of battery life and a magnetic mouthpiece cap that makes loading a breeze the 721 is a true two in one and the added ability to handle your wax makes us a very versatile unit comes with a wax canister tweezers a brush a USB cable and a set of earrings it takes 30 seconds to heat up and has a chamber capacity of point 4 grams with one button operation and ample vapor production you are going to be satisfied with every drop I like to send it to anyone for many reasons but my favorite parts of a deep chamber tasty vapor and how easy it is to use the one button on the side controls everything and the temperature options cover all the basics I would say this vaporizer is for fans of the crafty and mighty who can't splash the cash on a 300 plus dollar device all these reasons add up to the utility and 7:21 sitting in our number 5 spot coming in at number 4 the Arizer solo 2 is a great conduction vaporizer with flavor coming out of everywhere that long last stem that is a risers trademark cools the vapor really well before it hits your lips and the airflow is very free-flowing it comes with two of these glass aroma tubes a glass aroma dish some sample botanicals and no it's not the same kind of botanicals that we used to refer to on this channel actual botanicals a charger a carrying case with a belt clip if your feeling dad like to stem caps a stir tool and four screens the digital display and precise temperature control give you the ability to customize every aspect of your session and the three hours of battery-life is nothing to scoff at either the chamber holds up to 0.25 grams and it is nothing short of a workhorse vaporizer it is a well-built powerful device that will hit you harder than a freight train on steroids look the solo 2 was the third vaporizer I ever bought and I still have mine to this day it holds a special place in my collection and I love using it when friends come over or when I have a solo session I hate myself it's not necessarily a beautiful piece of machinery but it gets the job done and it is sturdy as hell one of my favorite things to do with the solo 2 is to run it through a water peace cooling the vapor down even more it gives some great smooth rips off a very capable device and that's why it comes in at number four coming in at number three the utili and 722 released at the end of 2019 brings a breath of fresh air to the award-winning view Tilian line the new sleek look and redesigned shell is classy as hell sorry and it's not just the aesthetics that have been updated this vaporizer maintains all the things that people loved event the 721 including 30-second heat up town while adding a couple more features utility does refine the airflow increase the maximum temperature and improved the boost mode all of these things add up to a better full spectrum extraction and I really love the changes to the 722 it comes with a cleaning brush tweezers a wax canister a set of o-rings and a USB charger the 2300 milliamp hour internal battery will have you vaporizing for 60 continuous minutes the included wax canister will help you paper as your favorite concentrate especially because the highest temperature has been increased to 225 degrees Celsius another true two-in-one the 722 is elegant in design and function features a point four gram chamber and has officially replaced the 721 in my lineup don't get me wrong I love the 721 but I just can't say no to a version update I love this vaporizer because didn't cost me much money and it looks and performs like a much more expensive device I call it my ballin on a budget vaporizer I'm sorry I said them nevertheless it comes in at our number three spot in spot number two the world renowned mighty from Storz and Bickel hasn't changed much in 2019 but it didn't really need to did it the mighty has great battery life tasty hits and packs a punch that could rival Anthony Joshua in the ring it is bigger than most portables surely but that trade-off gives you great design cool cool vapor and added functionality it features precise temperature control from 40 to 210 degrees Celsius the intricate cooling system housed in the mighty keeps your lips nice and chilly it's not a thing it comes with a grinder filling aid cleaning brush liquid pad extra set of o-rings charger and a dosing capsule for when you don't want to take your whole kit on the go look we all love the mighty if you have ever used a mighty there is a 100% chance that you enjoyed your experience if I could afford one I would have one I might steal this one don't tell anyone it features ninety minutes of continuous use that delicious flavor that Storz and Bickel is known for and can handle concentrates as well the reason it didn't make our number one spot is simple plastic if you've seen any of our other videos if I'm paying $300 for a device I don't want plastic yes I know it's not in the vapor path and yes I know it's specifically made plastic but still give me a nice tight metal body that sound gross I bet that sounded gross I didn't mean it nevertheless this is a fantastic vaporizer and that's why it sits in our number-two spot and now the moment you've all been waiting for or scrubbing - in our top spot this year is none other than the Zeus Ark named cannabis product of the Year at Oak cannabis 2019 the Ark is tiny and packed full of great features the haptic feedback will let you know when the unit is reached temperature and the accelerometer will detect when you haven't touched the unit in a while and will start to cool down to savior it also features an all gold vapor path which cools the vapor off really well and makes the hits off the zeus arc incredibly smooth comes with the charging cable a half pack spacer a flow singh tool and a bunch of cleaning tools it has a powerful 3500 million our internal battery which will last you 90 minutes of continuous use this high performance vaporizer offers massive clouds of flavorful vapor in a small compact body it looks incredible and the performance holds up to that look it's like picking up a novel with an awesome cover and then reading the novel and realizing you could have judged this book by the cover it gives me the high gloss German sports car feel I want in anything German made that tight metal body I was talking about earlier why did I say it again gross I've had my Arc since late 2018 when it was released and it is my go-to day-to-day device it is another unit I absolutely love ripping through my bomb one of my favorite parts about it is that it can come with you almost everywhere and it even fits inside of that don't lose [ __ ] pocket inside of your jeans you know that pocket in the pocket of your jeans I'm not gonna stand up and show you my lower half I'm not an animal but you get it either way all of these features add up to a fantastic vaporizer and that's why it's it's in our number one spot before we go a quick footnote we wanted to include the crafty plus in this list as it is another well-built device from Storz and Bickel the updates to the unit are great and I'll throw the link to the full video up in the corner here sadly Apple is seriously taken away from this device as they have removed all vaporizer apps from their App Store this means that roughly 50% of all vaporizer users will not be able to have the full experience of the crafty plus for those of you who have the Storz and Bickel app already this is a great device and definitely worth checking out but Apple helped Storz and Bickel elbow

I'll show you see the light lip and there was no vapor basically this is due to the cartridge and the battery not making connection typically in the center of the connections you'll notice here you see those two little buttons in the middle with the holes in them those are your center contacts and if those are just a hair off it will not make connection to each other and you don't get any vapor unfortunately there is an easy way to fix this and this not only works for the blackjack will that big slick but all the other electronic cigarettes on the market and I'll show you how to fix it all right so there's a magic tool that fixes your cartridges and that is a paper clip unfolded and just gonna separate the cartridge from the battery I'm using our big slick one of our most powerful batteries that we sell but in any case all the cartridges are the same right over here you'll notice your center contact with the hole in the middle and around that center contact is Valley and you'll notice the paper clip fits perfectly in between the threads of the cartridge and the center contact basically what you want to do to allow the center contact to make connection to the battery is just raise it upwards I'll show you the internals of a cartomizer in another video but for now the fix is just sticking your paper clip a met Valley which I get a better angle and prying against the outer part of the cartridge and you'll see that center contact raises upwards now if you pull this out too far it will pop out with our cartomizers push in very easily in 99% of time work again however try not to pop that out it shouldn't even be near the top but just raising it up I think we got least an eighth of an inch if not more all right so let's see if it worked catch our cartomizer to the big slick battery and that's it fix is what people think is a dead cartomizer just by raising the contact of the cartomizer and let it make connection to the battery", "cg3btKPRdwU": "hey everyone see her get stoned here doing another awesome review for you guys today I'm going over a product called timeless I'm going to be trying half gram strong manic art and their rest line if you're not familiar with timeless timeless products come in three different lines they have an energy a chill and a rest line so the rest line is supposed to help you possibly sleep or guide you into rest as I'm gonna be trying that out for you guys today and it says here that they're testing in the 90% range and that they're solvent free distilled THC oil with a hundred percent all natural plant and citrus terpenes so let's try it you open it the package your cartridge comes in this little childproof file it's a push down and unscrew I also have a timeless battery here to try our timeless cart with it's a 5-10 thread screw on it is buttonless so it's pulled to draw so you just need to hit it to activate it which is awesome and it's already set at the ideal temperature so that's really fun and as you can see here that it has a standard USB charger but it does not have a charging light indicator on it instead the timeless battery will light up at the bottom and then turn off when it's dead charging my have pre charge my timeless batteries so I could try my new timeless cart screw this one mmm it's really soft and smooth I have initial notes of fruit flavor little bit of straw strawberry banana it tastes like BAM give it that it's tasty it was delivered well so I really like it it's really tasty um it's also cool timeless comes with cases which you can put your pan in after dance now that I'm done using my medicine I could store it in here overall I feel sensations of relaxation and calmness um we'll see if it guides me into rest I'll leave that at a later date on the description of this video so thanks again thank you to timeless for let me try their best car and thank you to my viewers for watching my videos and you guys have a great day", "LODoIDizdi0": "if you want a canvas patient or of age please fight off of this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the vessel compass battery so it is a 510 threaded battery and we are going to be hitting it off of the grand daddy per papa zero cartridge from the last video so here it is trying to show it's just a small battery and it takes usbc and i also have a wireless charger for it that just sits on but i don't have a picture of that right now i might pop it up on the screen i don't know probably won't but there we go i'm gonna go ahead take a couple hits off of it and give a little sounds a nice hit nice straw so i do want to thank you guys for all the support recently i've been reading all the comments trying to respond to everyone and i see everything you guys have been typing and i really do appreciate it because you guys have been noticing the improvements in the videos i've been editing more trying to do more to videos and improving content so thank you guys for the subscribers comments likes all that i'm gonna take a couple more hits off of this and probably end up the video so this battery is good there are four heat settings i'm on a three out of four but i'm going to go ahead and take a couple more rips and end off the video keep it nice short and simple [Music] oh i feel like you got some smoke in my either oh one more rip getting on this off i feel like this video is going to be short there's not really much to talk about it's kind of like the other battery it's just a different type of design but it has the same heat settings as the other one so if you guys want to go ahead and watch the original vessel video it's just like a pen i kind of like that one better but it kind of rips the same i keep messing up on the ghost gotta improve but that's gonna be it for the video thank you guys for watching subscribe comment let me like all that and it's gonna be it thank you so much for watching and this ethan signing out [Music] peace [Music] you", "ZzlUeSYujww": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title there's another cartridge battery it is called the shiv by hamilton devices and i gotta say shout out to anna and the people that made this possible the hamilton devices is like the quality of these products have been mind-blowing like this pipe i've only tried one so far but this pipe is just crazy i just can't stop like holding it it's just so dope stylish but we're not talking about this one uh we're talking about this [ __ ] and i've seen some videos prior to making this video i would say this is the one of these batteries that has like one of the most features that i've seen in cartridge batteries lately and uh enough talking let's just you know open this there's an opening right here shout out to anna once again the people that made this possible dope products very dope products so we got the qr code good stuff you can pause if i'm going too fast a little split right here okay just open it okay this is a warning intended for adult use wow it's an experience just unboxing these things holy [ __ ] look at this [ __ ] this hasn't been all the way so warranty card you know about that i think it's six months same as the other one i would say let's just wow [Music] this has some [ __ ] weight to it man usbc too is right here right away this is dope wow so let's just set this aside and see what else is in here thank you for your purchase another one of these you could pause if i'm going too fast guys but damn look at this read me so from what i've gathered from watching that video is that this is cool because they can go in point one increments of the voltage so you can go as low as two voltages i believe um yeah the lowest is two to three 3.8 so that's a pretty pretty good a good range there you know you can go for the low voltage for your live residence higher for your you know distillates charge time one hour usb type c resistance 900 milliamp battery and look it has this little guide right here good positive i'm going too fast though hopefully it caught it and let's just get to it i do have my nug cartridge still so let's just pop this open see what's really really good about this so is this screw in oh this screw in you would think this would not be but here we are so it is not magnetic usually with these box mods it is magnetic but this is so dope so why they call it the shiv is that's wild that is cool so they did recommend not to have like leaf stickers on there or you know just stuff that would maybe make the diameter a lot wider than normal but yeah i mean it completely conceals it let's turn this on so five times i think one two three four five oh it has a little hamilton little shark thing right there so let's go down so as you can see i'm gonna go down to two let's see if you press down one more it'll go oh so if you press down and go to 3.8 if you go up from 3.8 will go to 2.0 that is dope it counts your hits as well all right let's let's start it this is dope cheers i wonder when the blinker is let me see let's just read about it 10 seconds 10 seconds so cheers oh that is flavor city right there so i'm gonna kick this up a notch maybe 2.6 let's do 2.6 cheers guys this is dope cheers oh yeah hands down this is probably the dopest battery the most functional the most it's hamilton devices man i don't know how much this cost but this like i said this feels like a [ __ ] box mod for wet like like e-liquids it's crazy it's it just fits fits in the hand you know you can fit hold it like this oh my god the only downside is that you kind of have to look over to see if you know you're done a blinker there's no like light indicating you kind of have to like look over like this but it's not really that much of a deal you know what i'm saying deal breaker let's take another hit and uh we're probably gonna end this video here uh what i'm gonna title this video is probably the best cartridge battery the most functional it's honestly it does above and beyond what what cartridge batteries should do and uh it's just so discreet too like like what am i like my beeper you know what i'm saying is my car [ __ ] bad or it's my car keys you know what i'm saying like this is dope wow i'm thinking yeah that's it for the video guys i i'm truly amazed by the the quality of these devices from hamilton or hamilton devices where the [ __ ] they're calling themselves truly blown away and uh yeah i still have two products of theirs to try and honestly i'm excited like if these two have been dope already i can't only imagine those so but yeah hopefully you did enjoy this video peace out guys [Music] you", "6pXRrfU_N-g": "hi guys I'm welcome to another video if you're new my name is Korra and today we're going to talk about red bed pods this is a vape cartridge system I really like these the style the flavours they're just an all-around good company it's a two-part system you do need the battery as well as the pods it does come with a charger it's an Android style charger you just charge it here on the bottom this is an auto pool it does have a little indicator light so that when you are pulling on it and you know you know that it's charged and everything the pods just drop in like so it's magnetic this one is about empty I'm sorry I just wanted to give it a decent Radio so I have used quite a bit of it anyways umm these come in sativa hybrid and indicas on the front it'll tell you it says right here how much percentage THC it is this is ninety three point two this is the wedding cake the only thing I don't like about these cards is they're 1/2 gram cartridges but to be honest it doesn't really bother me too much because I'm usually ready for another strain by the time I'm done with half a gram I don't usually honestly in my 1 gram carts I usually throw them away or give them away because I'm done with them you know I get tired of the flavor so half gram is actually kind of nice but anyways it's an auto pull battery this one is the wedding cake flavor or the wedding cake strain it is distillate so here we go Cheers all carts make me cough doesn't matter it just has a I always get a tickle in my throat sometimes it's worse than others just depends on the cart but if you guys are in a place where you can get the redbud carts and batteries you should definitely get you one I'm anxious to try another strain pretty soon so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you for watching please consider giving me a thumbs up like and subscribe down below all that makes me very happy so yeah thanks guys see there", "nJy5WO31Cm8": "hey everyone hope you're doing well today this is dave with innovative and today's video we're going to show you how to troubleshoot your vaporizer cartridge if you got it been using it and then all of a sudden it doesn't seem to be working so just like a battery you're going to have a positive and a negative connection on your battery here and that inside inner circle is going to be your positive connection and the inner threads that you see on the inside is going to be the negative connection so when they connect to the cartridge the outer threads the male part is going to be your negative and then inside the little kind of where you see the hole in the two lines that's going to be your positive connection and what can happen over time of taking the cartridge on and off when you charge your battery is that knit positive connection in between the center of the threads on the vape cart can actually recess down in there so when you put the cartridge back on your battery you're actually not making a complete connection so you can see in this video that it's pretty much flush at the top of the threads so that isn't going to make a solid connection so we have a real simple fix for you and that's going to be to take a little paper clip work it on the inside and slowly elevate that little center post so now you can see that it's just above the male threads which is the negative connection you can see the two lines right there and then when you screw it onto your battery you want to not go too tight you just want to make a snug connection so you don't recess that up in there again too far so make a connection just like that and your battery and cartridge should be good to go if you are in fact still having a problem you want to check that your battery is staying on with a steady green light if it's flashing after you inhale that means the battery needs to be charged so if the battery is not flashing has a steady light and you are still getting no vapor then there is a chance that the cart has become defective or damaged but no worries innovative backs their products 100 just take it back to the store you purchased it at or go to our website innovativecbd.com drop us a quick email and we will be sure to get you out a replacement any other questions you can always email us at sales innovativecbd.com thank you very much and hope you all have a wonderful day and uh have less problems and a better understanding of how to use this very simple yet sensitive vaporization device", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "Pe-mDXO91K8": "welcome to weeding aloud I'm Travis your host and today we have a grab bag from cetera the wellness center of Florida one of the many dispensaries in Northeast Florida I've got a dose cyst grab bag and I also got a hat that I left outside in the truck so what's a schwag trying out their new products and someday why was there a new dosis pens they got a lot just company cetera is very strained based strain-specific yeah I got tons of their info on their different flours and what they're what you know they have for each one like whether they have variable flow cartridges or whether they have legendary liquid gold oil and then for each strain they have the charts for you know relaxation uplifting effect happy appetite stress pain fatigue the normal what are their biggest most popular strains is obviously granddaddy purp Tillamook strawberry also one of my favorites the one that I'm going to be trying today is a local Florida strain Grune grown by the Myakka indians there is the Myakka native strain native to Florida State Eva rare sativa dominant hybrid from the Myakka region the strain is a subdued earthly profile due to its unique turpin profile citrus notes limo new Monet it's the terpene proton the strange TV dominant rings true for those searching for mental uplift always looking for a mental uplift that's not the one of the try first though we're gonna first wouldn't ride the dough cyst right here and this is the pamphlet for these these just came out they have bliss sleep calm relief these type boxes these tall boxes are for the 100 dose and this smaller one is a 50 dose it's just right there 50 doses cool thing about these is when you get that one dose in vibrates so it's a real handy way of kind of like you know I'm not going overboard if you're if you're really trying to you know keep track of how much oil you're in taking I mean me personally I don't have this thing in some kind of childproof thing it just compounding me watch you probably break it alright squeeze here and slide you seriously people are you watching this [Applause] my proves ain't been in this thing just got some kind of walking mechanism and it's I don't know it's it's uncanny I have no clue how squeezing here would release there beats the hell out of me and it makes no sense anyway this one is as I said for relief and the relief was the highest you got to two to one ratio I think was the highest ratio they had for this - THC - alright so here goes the dose cyst that went vibrated kind of like that's kind of little piney designed to work with your endocannabinoid system there's two those our product uses cannabinoids and Terrapins found in cannabis to deliver a target benefits the result is a safe and consistent experience with each and every formula pinch and hold at the top of the case so that arrows connect the whole pinching you place that thumb on the opposite end of the case i mighta memorize them if I didn't have an oxidant makes sense to me right three notices [Applause] getting that slight maintenance on the backside of that - of course already that comes right out that's heady though that's real petty no no you know I got some ups and downs some good things and bad things to say about this company these pins right here all two of them and within seven hours one has already went out on me and I paid $25 apiece for nice so I'm not really happy about that we'll get to this in a minute that is the Florida's finest all right these pens here and you have people saying cartridges no these are these are actually pitting income in this form they are actually called vaporizer and so don't hit me up in the comment section smartass is saying that it's a cartridge cartridge comes later this is an actual pin she's gonna like all right like I said I've already emptied one of these but the sad thing is it didn't even completely empty it just quit touching all five circles so then it started blinking with a considerable amount of oil in it and for $25 it didn't even last seven hours about two of these one for relax this is p.m. for relax and I bought one for relieve and earlier I was running errands run all over town and let's not stop until the minute and pretty much killed that thing in 20 minutes so sad to say that that piece really can be completely smoked in one setting just about the p.m. relax is really good though it does have a kind of like a blue dream kind of like undertone little Sour Diesel or something in there it's a little diesel e at the end or on the nose but I wasn't really impressed with these best especially for the twenty five dollar price tag not really a something that's gonna last now this bad boy here cream of the crop this is what they you know market is their this is these these major strings they mark it as their have the hitters and as such these are $85 per cartridge now I would venture to say that probably thirty dollars of that is in packaging because just looking at what every cartridge comes with it comes with a card with the oil cartridge all of the stuff about the same thing that's on that paper comes with the actual cartridges in Croker sack then inside the Croker sack you got this box really really nice packaging and then you open this box I've got this bottle so I mean you could just put the cartridge just inside the box or just inside the bottle and then in the back you didn't need both so then you're so excited already because this is looking good only to find what yeah that's right guys one of the cheapest most heavily used black-market cart has purported this company's best usage of their own oil to put it in this sad it was sad for me to see this I've been only difference between this and literally the worst carts ever made in the world is this right here the fact that this one has a variable opening variable air flow slot and they're really cheap and stone that's the only difference between this and the absolute cheapest black market cars that are out there these things are like 25 cent or maybe 10 cent a piece from China this particular just the cartridge itself when some of these you know nicer glass ones are like 80 and 90 seventies we're not just glass but like the brass and they're a bigger volume to look at the small volume of this this is like this can't be but 0.5 ml you know compared to a 1 a 1 ml and this was $85 3250 $85 let's see what $85 tastes like guys my turn they went lying about the citrus undertone it definitely has got that earthy on the front but then on the back you get that lemony kind of citrusy flavor it's there we go oh that's nice it's an $85 nice probably not like I said I think that most of that $85 or a good you know chunk of it this is wrapped up in all this all this fantasy presentation packaging all that there's all your extra money quit wasting your money on packages and they just put this damn thing in a box because I mean honestly what are people gonna do with all those Croker sack sack they've like bought 20 of these things and they got like Croker sack so little miniature Kroger sacks just floating around everywhere nothing but they're probably gonna throw them away honestly I mean if you only bought one you might keep it and like put some knickknacks in it or something use it for a glass bag to keep the pipe in if you got 20 of them it's gonna get old quick all right let's do one more good one where'd that damn dosage pin go I need a dose check out the vids on the oral oils from true lead and also the taro leaf it is the curly video on the the hybrid ex vape pen which is a must for any buddy wanting to buy flour from curly they use those flower chambers to go straight into the little car cartridge area and the dry herb chamber let's break out the dough spin did you hear that [Music] mmm it's like a little buzzer and like the vibrator on your phone how many was that five I lost count let's see if this thing has yeah you've really got to be spot-on if you're writing 50 doses on this thing and you know that you know it's gonna put out 50 that's pretty it's pretty on the nose I don't know exactly 50 I would like to say that it might have like 48 to 52 or something you know like I'd hoped that it had 60 that way they just knew that they went so far over that they definitely had 50 but I will give you feedback on that and whether it actually does have 50 yeah so up next we're gonna be doing a review on some glass that's got a pickle Ric pipe in yeah can't wait to try that out and some new chalets from grab-grab labs all on the cheapest on amazon so check it here first and weeding allowed signing off please", "uMsjGzQxpR0": "hey guys I'm back with another how to do video and this one is

[Music] [Applause] hello everyone welcome to Brian unbox in this video we will be taking a look on how the Skullcandy Indy compares with the Apple earpods - I have done a complete unboxing and review on both of the earbuds in my previous videos they will be available at the end of the video and in the description below along with the product links I will go over some brief specs take some measurements provide microphone samples and give my final thoughts if you are new to my channel or have been here before thanks for taking the time to watch also don't forget to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out on future videos and give it a thumbs up as well so let's take a look and just to go over some brief specs the Skullcandy Indy has a following 4 hours of listening time 16 hours with the case it uses Bluetooth 5.0 has touch controls microUSB for charging and it's IP 55 sweat water and dust resistant the Apple earpods 2 has 5 hours of listening time 24 hours with the case Bluetooth 5.0 it has touch controls and also the hey Siri function the charging case uses a lightning adapter and also has wireless charging it's not sweat proof or water resistant here you see the charging case side-by-side both are made of plastic and the indicates is definitely larger they each have the LED indicator on the front of the case the indi has a micro USB charge port on the bottom and the air pods have the Lightning port the back of the indi is planed while the air pods has the pairing button and here is the air pod case on a wireless charger you can see a charge you can also purchase the air pods - without the wireless charging case the lid on the Skullcandy case is firm and it closes nicely the earbuds are held into place by magnets so it's pretty secure inside the air pass case is also solid and the earbuds are held into place by magnets the Skullcandy in deep earbuds are plastic all around and it features the following it has touch controls LED status a stability gel interchangeable ear gel tips a microphone and the charging contacts controlling the earbuds are done by tapping on the outside and I have detailed the controls in my previous review video and here it is side by side the air pods is also plastic all around with a slim stem it features a following it has the microphones battery antenna dual optical sensors dual accelerometers and the h1 chipset it also has the touch controls on the outside along with the hey Siri commands and here is a side-by-side look of the earbuds the air pods is definitely slimmer and now for some measurements the indy case comes in at 2.5 by 2.2 by 1.1 inches the air pod case comes in at 1.7 by 2.1 by 0.8 inches the indy earbud is about 1.6 inches long and the stem is about 0.3 inches wide the air pod there's also 1.6 inches long and the stem is 0.2 inches wide weight-wise the Indy case is 48 grams and the air pod case comes in at 41 grams the Indy ear pods come in at 11 grams while the air pods come in at 8 grams and now for some microphone samples this is a test of the Skullcandy Indy microphone testing one two three testing one two three this is a test from the microphone of the Apple earpods to testing one two three testing one two three I found that the air pods microphone was clearer and louder when it comes to watching videos both earbuds perform well and I didn't experience any latency using my iPhone they also had good range one thing to keep in mind if you want to use the Indy on one ear there would have to be the right side as that is a master on the air pods you can use either the left or the right side individually so here are my final thoughts on the earbuds I always start off by saying sound can be subjective and everyone enjoys different types of sound signatures I have the Skullcandy Indy on my right ear and the air pods - on my left starting off with comfort the design is a bit different as the Indy goes into your ear canals and the air pods just sit outside so the air pods for extended periods of time are much more comfortable than the Indy but the Indy does fit well and feels more secure with the stability gel build and quality I would have to say the Indy they both feel durable and both have a plastic feel to them design wise the air pods are a bit more compact and portable but the Indy stands out because it has the ip55 rating so that is definitely a plus for those that lead active lifestyles when it comes to sound starting off with the lows the Skullcandy Indy definitely had a lot more bass than the air pods both weren't overblown and don't expect heavy hard bass from these earbuds mids and highs in my opinion were very good on both and it's hard to differentiate between them you can hear vocals and instruments with clarity and it's very clean so when it comes down to it I feel that the Skullcandy indeed has terrific value at its price point and it's definitely an alternative to the Apple earpods - it can appeal to those that have active lifestyles or just want to use it for casual listening the air pods price point is definitely higher and it will be hard to justify with the many competing ear buds at a lower price

today I'll be reviewing and comparing the tax era and the cz against each other to show you the differences the pros and cons of both and which is actually worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to dive deeper into either one of these vape pens have a suggestion for another vape pen or just a question let me know down below if you want to see more cannabis related content like this stay subscribe to see my newest videos like the next one we'll be showing you how to refill these pods with your own concentrates or follow me on social media if you enjoyed the review please leave a like thanks for watching", "fle-ESBzrmY": "here we're going over the most common problems that occur with the Atmos RX battery and charger and a few ways to prolong the life of your equipment first let's go over how to keep your battery clean on occasion a tiny bit of oil may drip down onto the center contact point of your battery causing it to stick to the charger possibly ripping out the internals of either your battery or charger when you disconnect it the best way to clean your battery and charger is to wipe it clean with a q-tip and some rubbing alcohol be careful not to put too much pressure on the contact point because you can push it down into the battery now let's go over connection problems and how to fix them by adjusting the center contact point one issue is the battery not charging when you connect a battery to a charger you should see the bottom of the battery blink a few times and then the charger light should turn from green to red if you connect your battery and it doesn't blink or the light on the charger doesn't turn red then you most likely have a contact point that needs to be raised you may also encounter this problem when trying to use a cartridge or a heating chamber and it doesn't work always check your contact point when any of these problems occur now let's go over fixing the contact point here I suggest using a small pair of tweezers but any skinny object like a paperclip or hair pin will work just fine what you want to do here is very gently wedge up the center point of the battery from each side till you feel you've raised it just enough to make contact you want to be careful not to use too much force because you can rip out the contact point and possibly ruin the battery we hope this video was helpful make sure to check out all our videos for more tips on other Atmos products", "_Zl3JFrkz2Q": "[Music] hi my name is Peter I'm with air vapor systems and we help businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "UmjFtUa94qA": "there's a review of the cloak 510 vaporizer battery it has a 650 mah capacity battery it is 3 point 6 volts it is rechargeable via micro USB port with a cord included it is inhaled activated so you don't have to press a button so no button while inhaling is required right now it only comes in black but soon it will come in red blue and white so what's so cool about it is that it conceals and protects your vape cartridge so it allows for a stealth vaping experience all while keeping your cartridge protected and hidden so here's what's in the box say too much frame those are little instructions goes over everything I just said working voltage is 3.2 to 4.2 volts charging voltage let's see low power warning LED flashes eight times charging time is about one and a half hours resistance range is 0.5 to 2.2 protection timer of puffs or per puff is 10 seconds so we'll stop hitting after 10 seconds it accepts all 510 thread cartridges which is pretty much what everybody uses so here's the box see it is pretty bad get your USB cable this pretty much comes with all the units these days you get a couple of these little rubber gaskets that keeps it sealed which I'll show you why in a minute so I was pretty excited about this cuz it's nice and discreet so it keeps everything protected so more light so there's actually unit there's where you inhale right there that's the microUSB port on the bottom and how you open it is you just pull this top off like that and then there's your cartridge right there a little magnet so it keeps this on top hopefully you can see that sorry about the bad lighting again and then you simply put your mouth on here and inhale I think that was in frame so it's actually pretty powerful which I'm kind of surprised of but it seems like a pretty strong design and like I said it protects it you know slides over and it seems pretty sturdy to get the cartridge in I'll show you so this is a Graham cartridge I'll show you with one of my tallest cartridges I have here so you just screw it in like so I don't think it really matters where it sits and then you just slide this over slide it down it kind of clips a little and that's it right there I'll show you with a smaller cartridge as well I thought it really matters I guess but just so you know it's everything since you're half gram there's a few different cartridges here so mostly see celled a couple of different other brands and like I said you just slide that over and then it clicks down and seals into place and then there you go so it's not too bad I like how it keeps it protected like I was saying so in case you drop it it doesn't break it and that's about it if you have any questions or you want to purchase it the link is down below thank you", "fcNXNFtP-fA": "yo [Music] hey guys and

below and we'll see you guys on another video peace guys", "kBbqaEMgesc": "hello and welcome back to another video today I would like to talk about a really really common problem and it is the center pin issue what is that you may ask the center pin issue is if this little plate inside here is too low and doesn't make any proper connection anymore with this little pin inside here with the atomizer positive pole or with sorry with the positive pole of your atomizer which is this bit in here most people think the battery is completely faulty and can't you can't go to work any more that's actually a little mistake because you can get it to work if you bet this Saturday the center pin actually can be too low after week of use after 2 weeks of use after 3 weeks of use or even after 6 month I don't know the reason for that is actually some atomizers have quite outstanding opinion here some batteries have a pin in here which is a bit lower or which is a bit more inside and therefore you can experience these these contact issues unfortunately and in this video I would like to show you how to fix it all you need to do is actually to take your battery and take your needle I take this needle from a multi meat for my multimeter now and you go inside see carefully and now you move this plate a bit into this direction and then you turn your battery around like so ah that is not easy doing it in front of a camera and you move it back into this direction and now try to get into the back into the middle again like so I really hope you can see that properly and then screw the atomizer back on it let's check it I hope you can hear that so this is working in again so all you need to do is actually just erase that center pin a tiny bit with the needle or something like that but do it careful and then you on the safe side and that's actually it so your battery's probably not faulty it's just a little reconnection problem and that's it thank you very much for watching and I speak to you soon gyah", "BmJZPhk9Y5s": "if you're not a canvas patient or of age please fight off of this video yo guys what's going on ethan here today we are going to be reviewing the dank tank battery so they did send me a couple of them so i have the blue one here unopened i have the black one here unopened and then i did open the red one for myself i already put my battery in and all that but here's pretty much what comes with it it comes with like a little lanyard a charger and then this one gram cartridge unopened obviously so i went ahead and put in my true leaf cartridge so it also does come with a magnet so since this is a half gram it does look kind of weird in here but it's not a big deal if you really want to keep it portable this is super super small so i'm going to go ahead and read off the back of it so i'm going to show you guys this and i'm going to read off the back of the other one so 650 milliamp battery i'm just going to read them the important things 3.2 volts to 4.2 the ceramic atomizer that's the ones that comes with it and then the charger and all the basic stuff nothing nothing too special but the lanyard does go on this piece right here and since this is the red battery came with the red lanyard i'm assuming this one is going to be blue and this one is going to be black but here is the cartridge itself the tree leaf cartridge i forgot the strain exactly but if you guys are looking at this battery i'm gonna have the link down below so you guys can go ahead and check it out it does help me out if you guys go ahead and use that link but let's go ahead and take a hit [Music] so you guys didn't see that this was lighting up but this is going to be the medium setting so it's going to be like purple and i don't know what the other one is let's see blue okay so it's like red purple and then like blue so this is the medium so it should be like 3.6 volts something around there and go ahead and hit it again this way you guys can actually see the color [Music] one second so if you guys are wondering why there was a cut i got a phone call so i was just answering that but yeah this little battery does hit well the good thing is that it's small and that's also a bad thing so it's kind of annoying if you like having a full grip on the battery but you can also palm this battery so you can't even see it if you really want to conceal it but i'm going to go ahead and take another rib i've taken like two or three already i'm gonna go ahead and take another one jeez all right it's like the third rip i'm going to take like one or two more i can see if they can take a blinker i don't know if this battery does but we'll see [Music] i don't know how many seconds i was but that was enough that i could take before i just coughed it all out so it would have been kind of useless of a hit because i wouldn't have been able to inhale it but yeah this is a nice battery i do have these other two maybe i'll give one away on my instagram and give one to my friend but you guys can go ahead and look out for that my instagram is at i'm ethan smokes you guys can go ahead and check that out but this is the battery like i said you guys can't go ahead and look at the link down below and if it's not there look at the comments because youtube is kind of annoying with the links and stuff like that so you guys can check that if not it might be on my instagram or my twitter it's the same handle so you guys can go ahead and check that out i can take one more hit and then end off the video [Music] thank you guys for watching make sure you guys leave

check this check Rove out hit them up go get one", "qC9kjfAu2MU": "hey guys it's Nick with blue farms here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "HcUBqHWDoHY": "[Music] next we're going to take a look here at the m60 cartridge which we refer to internally as the c6 now this cartridge as stated before has an all plastic body along with a plastic tip which helps to reduce costs while still keep retaining the C cell performance inside now this cartridge is available in two different finishes currently along with two different tip types now you can have either a chrome body with a flat plastic tip or you can get an all gold body with a round plastic tip here now these are absolutely interchangeable if you want to put the round tip onto the chrome body you can if you want to put the flat tip onto the gold body you can these are just here for examples however you can also get each of these colors or each of these tips in solid colors as well so if for example you wanted to have an all black tip or maybe an all white tip made out of not clear plastic that is an option you have to order in quantities of ten thousand or more in order to achieve that sort of OAM custom design but the great news is that you can order ten thousand of only the tips so you can buy the bottoms as you need them which is something that we recommend to help kind of save capital as you're trying to build a business but this is available again with two different types of tips as well as two different finishes on the body and you can apply a two color logo anywhere on the plastic tank housing you can then also apply coloured bands and or colored logos and or laser etching anywhere on the metallic colors at the bottom or the top again we don't provide any nor do we recommend any sort of branding or Lowe going here on the tips because a user's lips will touch these tips and you don't want them to ingest any paint chips or anything of the sort so we do not recommend branding on the tips however with these small amount of variations you can really create an endless different type of looks for this cartridge while still keeping your costs down and affordable for every user [Music]", "evI6IIFxum4": "young girl wit up at your boy group and back with another wholesome video here on YouTube one of the greatest platforms there is with one of the greatest subs there is you so thank you all for watching this video today this video is for patients 18 and older and yeah so let me get into it um last night I went to a calm the comedy store in Hollywood and went to see Joey Diaz and David Alan Grier and all that it was fun it was cool it was it had a good time and before that I wanted to stop somewhere so I stopped at Lake cush and picked up an ounce of cush berry cheesecake because it was on special it was cheap so I grabbed it and it was fire and I grabbed a f9 cartridge flight Farms new straw Nanna new straw Nanna strain that they just came out with flight farms in the f9 magnetic battery battery cost more than the cartridges I had it last night I liked it um it got me stoned the only issue I had was that the oil kind of ran out quick um was i hitting it yeah but I I just like with these seashells I noticed that um I believe is to see so I don't know let me see it's one of those magnetic batteries but kind of looks like a sea so anyway it's not it's magnetic but anyway it has those four chambers 1 2 3 4 5 5 chambers at the bottom so I'm guessing that's where the oil is that so that's where it goes so that's why I goes quickly but other than that it says strong NIT I barely taste the strawberry I mainly taste a banana which is great that it's awesome so here it is I'm taking it for you guys now right off the bat that's strong banana taste I love it um the only thing I don't love about the flight farms is that they go so quick you know what I mean they go so quick this battery I love I went to La Push when they had these bla these flight farm batteries buy a cartridge get a battery for a dollar sale and I'm glad because there's no way I would have spent 42 I mean I'm granted this is a very cool battery it's a very cool battery because number one it vibrates you know what I mean it's very discreet it's very I don't know I just I don't know some about this I do appreciate this battery I don't know what it is and this thing does take some clouds you know what I'm gonna do for you guys I still have some birthday cakes dizzy and I have the straw Nana flight farms so I'm gonna just hit both right

well make sure to do something positive for somebody else today I put that on my Facebook two days ago and I'll tell you what I almost forgot to do with that to do something positive but I do I didn't do anything positive for someone but I did something positive for something here in Southern California where I am I don't know I feel like the butterflies were migrating or something or whatever and there was just a shitload of butterflies and there was some injured so I picked some up and put them on the leaf and you know I mean I did I took him out of the street you know I mean so yeah I mean I guess I didn't do anything good I would've did that anyway but I'm gonna do that today do something good for somebody else the other day I copped that ounce know yesterday I copped an ounce and I was about to just give somebody a gram yesterday but my my girl was driving too fast I mean a gram isn't that much but when you're not expecting it and somebody just gives it to you and you don't have weed and like no it's pretty cool anyway it's been a pleasure hanging with you guys deuces", "LUDYeJtJidU": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome today we are going to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "hAPejPvr5UU": "hey it's mad at roughhouse studios and welcome to my review of the tick vaporizer from eros before we get started I would like to thank the guys at Aris Tech for sending out the tick and for sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about Aris tech products please visit our stead calm now let's get started here's what comes in the box with the tick vaporizer you get the tick vaporizer unit itself there's a little accessories package in it you have the two brass rings that couple it to the cartridges and also the micro USB charging cable the instructions are on the back of the box right now let's take a closer look at the tick unit itself it's a really nice elegant design you can see the bottom plate is metal plate with a screw on so you could access the batteries it's a micro USB charging port on the side and then there's one single function button on the front it's got a hinged top like a Zippo lighter and it flips open like that inside you have the the port that you put your cartridge down into it fits almost any size 510 cartridges that's like ecig type cartridges and there's a little slit and the sides that you can see the the cartridge and fill level and then we have these two brass rings that are magnetized and these are fittings that will fit various size cartridges into the tick now keep in mind it does not include any cartridges it's just the vaporizer battery itself and the fittings that will hook it to various size cartridges and then it has a magnetic fitting inside and as you can see there the little slit lets you see the quantity of your a cartridge and then it's got that swing top that completely conceals and protects the cartridge now we'll get the tick charged up and take a look at the functions and features you can see that there's a little red light there that will stay on while it's charging and then when it's fully charged the light goes off you power the tick with five clicks of the button it has three different settings that you can access with three clicks of the button Green is 3 point 4 volts then the blue is 3 point 7 volts and red is high at 4 volts so nice variable voltage function it cuts off with 5 clicks and that's it is really simple to use as far as the functions and features but my favorite part is always it's that usage and testing is it going to load it up with cartridge F some Lauzon made whacks there and my EC cartridge I'm gonna put it on high cuz I like to get the big puffs especially for the camera there if they're small puffs it looks like the vaporizers not doing a good job so you have to get the big puffs and it did not let me down it got really good nice puffs off of it really good flavor and it was really nice to have the variable voltage I left it on high pretty much the whole time because I'm a bit of a hog but it is nice to have that lower voltage if you have different kinds of cartridges or if you just want smaller smoother hits I really did like the performance of it I loved that swing top that covers up the cartridge you know so you don't break it in your pocket but let's look at the pros and cons it's got that perfect size 650 milliamp battery the compact elegant design that I really like with the cap that protects and conceals the cartridges the varial voltage which is really nice if you want different types of cartridges or different types of hits and it fits almost any kind of 510 cartridges comes in three colors red white and black and I really had no cons to mention on this when I grown it five stars Aires tech vaporizer is a really cool it's innovative and nice way to do your cartridges without breaking them and it's really discreet so if you want to learn more about it and Aris tech products visit Aires

thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis accessory reviews today we have a killer battery for 510 threaded vape cartridges from an awesome company that i've absolutely come to love what is it it's the compass from vessel and vessel is just absolutely a killer brand these guys blew me away with the first vape pen that i got and i reviewed and i had to get their next versions uh their original vessel battery has been just incredible and i have loved every bit of it um so i can't wait to try this one with a larger battery a different design and some cool other things so let's dive into it vessel is a company out of california it's designed in california everything's assembled in china this one's ultra compact ergonomic power optimally tuned air intake design cartridge swivel variable power smart power management long lasting 550 milliamp battery that's massive that's double the size of this original battery so that's huge and this one lasts you know usually an entire cart so 550 milliamps is great usb c charging badass you know it'll be really quick and it's got a six month warranty uh so let's open it up i don't even know what color this is look it might be gold that would be bad ass the gold fits my swag this package really nice it's packaged like an apple product as we have come to expect from nice electronic companies i believe this one is like oh i can't remember 60 us dollars like 100 canadian dollars so let's crack into it i've been waiting to try this battery out very excited i love the i love the stiffer cell phone i don't know what it is stuck to me beautiful box nice raised whatever you guys don't care about the box you care what's in it oh from the moment you pick up your vessel you'll obsess over its signature design and character we work relentlessly to make your every experience more intuitive personal delivering the best design performance in our line of products the collection is an honest demonstration of our attention to detail and craftsmanship look at how beautiful that unit is that's absolutely gorgeous uh love it you know that is one thing these guys are are like that apple standard that's kind of what we hold every electronic standard to these days is like they're the apple standard of vape batteries and the retail store we were selling more vessel batteries than anything uh get started we're gonna want to register it we're gonna charge it i like to kill my batteries before i charge them load it and enjoy power on off with five rapid clicks and three to change it five volt charger only start using the lowest setting and work your way up that's what we've got in the box that falls out nicely and it is this beautiful gold so i'm i'm stoked that i got a matching set because i love that gold and it's a really nice design you know what i actually like in my suit jacket is this tends to fall over in my in my pocket and this one you know i can i will actually be able to find it's not and it's totally different really like the design you can see the usbc down there uh looks like they might have a clip charger coming in the future from these toggles or these attachments going on at the bottom but great color well let's put a cart into it and see what happens i got this cart from hexo that i did a review on and then you screw that in and then it swivels it screws in and then it has a tight swivel so that you can i believe maybe not oh yeah you get you get 180 degrees of swivel so that's nice so that i can always have the optimal mouth piece that egg's pretty cool and now my cart's protected so it's a good good traveler one two three four five our lights are on there we go perfect and i'm on light blue that's my lightest setting i love how it looks the color the feel the look of it the taste of it the smell of it the texture i love gold so much the edges it feels like a really nice uh car key this is this is beautiful love it let's try it out killer airflow i it i should mention the smart battery that has its variable voltage on how it draws if you're ripping on it it likes to mitigate the battery a little bit so that every puff is consistent between everybody especially if you're passing it around very smart battery great technology big rips coming out of it let's try it here one more time i think it's huge that i can actually move this that's really nice and then we'll take it back out knock it past and i just want to do a little comparison to the original battery this one's a lighter airflow it's not ripping as hard wow that's fantastic okay so let's say this is a lighter airflow and this one's actually one temperature hotter so double the battery moving mouthpiece uh very slick design um you got your very you like i said the smart battery slick design good nice big easy button hidden tank killer [ __ ] battery um i love these vessel products i i love this one a lot uh this one might start being my everyday carry just because i really like how it sits in the palm of my hand um and i've been loving this one for a long time i have multiple colors i love them so much this is like it's a great accessory if you smoke carts at all and you don't have a vessel brand battery you're kind of screwing up this is like the mont blanc pen of vape batteries absolutely fantastic cannabis somalia approved stand behind it 9 out of 10 the only thing that would make the vessel lineup better for me is if they bluetooth and i could start having some more control with my phone to the degree temperature seeing how many puffs i took that's literally the only thing that could be better for me these are the best batteries that i've ever used for anything and i will continue using them and standing behind them love it love it love it go check them out thank you so much for watching i hope you make sure to like comment share and subscribe until next time cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis somalian", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars

i'm back with another review and [ __ ] and today i have something that was requested and today it's a robe for a real ca stamped rope like a [ __ ] real last rover right this is my first time getting one of these so we're looking at everything boys look at all that i don't know if y'all can see but it says um total cannabis 88.6 percent total thc 84 percent total cbd 0.3 so there's not much cbd in here yeah it's a disposable and we're about to see what's good it's a og indica it's just og but see what this og is tasting like damn you gotta rip the sticker off to open it and everything so it's like i don't know i guess the plugs can't open it before they sell this and [ __ ] so that's cool damn there's hella safety shits on here bro this shit's like i'm sorry if i'm quiet while opening this is because i'm kind of concentrated because it's just got a bunch of safety features on these [ __ ] and these shoes are over doing it already there you go this is what it's looking like right here see a stamp that's beautiful sheesh i need to quit playing with a rogue this is so sleek and it comes with the tip covered up and it charges the bottom alright man stop playing with it boys where is it oh wow oh bro i had a fake ass ropes before never like this the taste was similar but bro the way this just hits you bro [ __ ] kicks you in the chest bro like and you just feel that [ __ ] like you want to do a bubble test on it like a little bubble test [ __ ] is thick it's [ __ ] bro oh twenty percent better but all right oh we're cool enough all right oh i don't know like with the way we treat his [ __ ] be like oh yeah this tastes like some og i don't know bro i don't mean like remembering wheat strains taste like this tastes similar to some [ __ ] i've had before right but like i don't remember like like people be [ __ ] knowing all this [ __ ] like i don't know like i know a good amount but i'm not like very like like hella hella into it like maybe more later on when i start um actually smoking robot and [ __ ] on the channel and [ __ ] and then we'll will really be on like that but yeah it's just clean as a mug i'm about to hit a blinker bro better hit blinker and really [ __ ] test this [ __ ] out like look at the top of it oh gee oh gee this is just clean bro i messed up that don't count that's some [ __ ] good [ __ ] [ __ ] right there bro just leaving a good taste in my mouth like a fire ass taste but damn bro this [ __ ] is [ __ ] like reminding me over like when i first started cheating bro and like like my lungs were [ __ ] eyes back there like not like i couldn't like take as much like i wasn't like my thomas wasn't as high basically and [ __ ] i would call vicious like the way it would hit me with this like fishes and the way this is hitting me it just reminds me of like in the back in the day the way it's just hitting me like [ __ ] giving me flashbacks and [ __ ] bro but yeah i think that's the end of this video for today bro something definitely recommend this if you see this in your area it's on fire bro", "AIWclTyrV30": "[Music] [Music] what is up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another versus video i have two of the devices that i've gotten recently and i figured let's put it to the test uh we're gonna say i'm gonna say what i like about both of them what i don't like about uh both of them like i'm stuttering i actually took a hit previous so i'm sorry also i like to mention is that uh rj eats is filming and he's laughing right now because i [ __ ] up but we also got ben right here i like to mention you guys have been asking for a custom bandana i actually have one on right now it's actually one-sided uh i will show you the design but i'm gonna say something right now that i actually got a shittier one i ordered a shittier one for myself uh because when i uh i was i was actually happy to find like a website that did custom bandanas so i basically made this design i put it up there and it said it was a low quality image and i still ordered it but the one that i have on the website i readjusted it it's a bigger size and it actually has like a a little bit of a different design in the corner but nonetheless still the same design i'll post on the screen right now uh but yes back to this we are using uh the dip vapor this is an e-rig and then this i don't know what this is this is probably a portable uh email is what i would consider it a portable email and uh on a bomb or on a dab rig so what we're gonna be using first is the dip this is going to run you at about 180 but i unfortunately i know i have a code for you to get 15 off if you do want it uh it is on red right now so uh [ __ ] we are gonna we're not gonna use the dip first this is all red right now but we're chilling we're chilling we got that stuff we're still running with the show so uh let's see this is oh [ __ ] all right so basically what this is is a portable email uh if you have a rig you basically just put on top and it basically makes any dab rig an electric rig basically you put this on here it becomes one of the electric rigs but uh it is a more pricier setup you know this in uh this piece itself is 250 and then you're gonna have to get a bong i believe this bong was 30 right yeah 30 bucks yeah and uh also you know you have to get a compatible bong because not a lot of these are gonna have the thing on top you know some are gonna have them right here and it's just gonna be very heavy and fall over you know so you're gonna have to you know find the right bond for this specific thing but this device in itself is just dope you know i i do have the video it will obviously be uploaded before this video uh and you would have seen it by now i already did up edit that video though just to let you guys know and uh yeah from you've seen their in their faces from it they [ __ ] love this uh yeah it's basically still uh brand new i've used it i would say three times and uh all three times uh consistent consistent hits you know what i'm saying fat [ __ ] hits uh what i did mention in here i believe it's a usbc 30 minute to charge and you get 30 to uh dabs so that's pretty [ __ ] good you know if you're a guy that wants your dabs and for something this is actually i did a video on this right now but you would see it before it's actually the connected uh and bezel this is guava 2.0 okay you know that so this is actually going to be pretty hard to possibly put in here because it is you know look at this [ __ ] oh actually it's not that hard all right so with this you double tap and then it'll go to heating and then as it's heating up you can hit it and what you don't uh what you don't need on here is a cap because it's reverse airflow technology apparently so i don't know how to explain that the science behind that but that's what it is and that's probably why you don't need a cap on top but today all right no all right one of the hits you know i'm gonna give them a hit also but i like to mention is i don't know if there's interchangeable coils or buckets like e-rigs you know e-rigs they come with silicone carbide they come with ceramic they come with even quartz you know some of them uh this one i believe it's only one and it's a ceramic but you know people love ceramic it tastes [ __ ] fire on ceramic uh i do i like to mention that ceramic does seem to stain a lot uh easier than others uh but this device itself you could take apart and then just submerge it in isopropyl alcohol and uh it's pretty much very easy to clean i haven't cleaned it just yet because you know i've only used it like three times and it's just been vaporizing like everything like i really don't need to like i mean look at this [ __ ] i mean see it's kind of stained already but it is you know what it is having like some more in there but yes all these uh the links to the products will be in the comments below guys uh youtube's been uh [ __ ] with me you know if i do put stuff in the description i don't know if putting in the comments exactly is gonna avoid that but i don't know uh it seems to be working i haven't gotten any strikes uh that's what the other youtubers be doing so um but we are going to give it to ben so ben this is guava 2.0 you know the deal it's heating up right now but shout out to ben you guys already know the deal you want to say anything about this or after you hit it or before you hit it yeah uh wait till i hit it because i think it's about to be ready yeah i'm actually considering buying a dab rig after after getting one of these but then you have anything to say about this piece in in general yeah it's still still amazing like it still gives you that nice quality dab it doesn't give you that burning taste because it's like at the perfect temperature it's overall really great device there you go all right and you haven't cleaned it since no nice yeah all right randall that's his uh i got hello nicknames whichever you want you want that pleases you go ahead honey i'm saying all right so we're gonna double tap that there you go sir now sir well crandall sir boyle jolly i'm a grown man now i'm a sir just hit it all right how do you know it's ready when you put this right and it says that's [ __ ] cool man now it says i didn't know that at first it also vibrates don't press it yeah what the [ __ ] you press it after with this he blew it at john lennon i should have blew it over here let's do it again for the people is there still though no nothing for the people just uh here you go we gotta do it just you're done you're done that's up again ben's camera man all right that's right i like you to take over actually so i can lay down that's comfy right here that's where i want to be my back hurting looks like it's still red blinking failure no i was good for somebody i think so yeah we're gonna just share this uh because it i mean the session mode on here is a quite long much longer than here uh another thing about this like i said there's interchangeable buckets there's it's a more dab like experience you know you actually dab it and then there's carbs or a carb cap uh yeah and it's all in one you know uh yeah that's pretty much it i mean you do have interchangeable glasses as well uh but let's just let's just take a [ __ ] hit [Music] okay all right i would say that um the clouds are much fatter on here but it is a new device this one's a bit you know used uh the bowl is uh it's not as it's in pristine condition i would say a point it's still nice here hit this yeah yeah but this still hits guys uh and it's relatively cheaper you know coming in at about 160. i gotta diabetics better if you're expecting fat clouds that's what i mean that's what i'm trying to get across you also got to consider that the battery absolutely oh it is low but i do like that device though i will say that that one was much better than the smoke see you had yeah much better the smoke ski is better quality in terms of like the the build quality i would say but no of course so the even though like maybe when that one is fully charged it might hit better i don't know but like i don't know that that bag still like if you're very expensive if you're expecting a fat cloud you want to go to dab x for sure it's just uh it's not at its full potential guys right now it's still hitting like you guys seen previous videos um but i'm still gonna run with this versus video at the end of the day i'm just gonna show you what i like about both products you know they're very similar yet so different because one is attachable to a bong one is an all-in-one you basically put this on a dab break to become one of these you know yeah they're both good yeah they're both good they felt good that's that's all i'm one like i said that one's way better than the smoke scooter you got like it hits better yeah we know it's not the smoke ski in here though we're comparing these two yeah i'm just kidding but yeah like i said uh in terms of hit wise definitely better than the smoke ski but i like the build of the smoke ski better uh like the clouds are here man like then you're still taking hits yeah so this is more i would say of a party one because the the sesh time is longer i don't know actually there is a dab time on here i gotta [ __ ] with it more but there's there's certain features on here that i didn't play with in the the original video but i believe there is a dab mode let me see look at it here oh yeah dab mode skip preheat so you hold it for one second then you press it for a dab mode so that could possibly mean you know longer sessions i don't [ __ ] know but uh yeah just uh i wouldn't say a fool versus video uh it this is this is purely just a video of me comparing i would say the two best devices that i got recently uh you know that are similar you know i would put the email in here but you know it's it's stationary and all that stuff but uh let me know your comments you know you've seen the videos for both of them what do you think is is good and at the end of the day if you're going to consider purchasing any of these things these are all well above 150 worth of products so do your research you know there's plenty of things on the market and there's plenty of videos on the market so at the end of the day do your research and find the one that's best for your ideal situation you know sometimes maybe this isn't you know this isn't like for your situation but maybe this is you know what i'm saying there's just there's just things right things for everything um and that's what's cool about like the the product market or the device market when it comes to cannabis it's not a monopoly you know i'm saying there's just so many different things at different price points you know but that with ending with that i'm pretty [ __ ] happy with that we're gonna end it here uh does anyone have anything to add i mean or you pretty much said all your [ __ ] i don't know you you stayed at a lot of good points right now i feel like you laid it all out you know and all right and they're both good advices yeah all right so uh hope you did enjoy this video shout out to rj eats and be legit for you know helping us or helping me with the video he's floored it's actually better to have uh other people's uh opinions on these versus videos you know so other than that yeah hopefully you enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] one is [Music]", "wPu5weGONMY": "[Music] slip it on this single model whiskey put this right in the middle here get on

So, where do you put the fluid, why do you need power? I know nothing about this. - Yup, that's exactly what I thought. What the heck is a Juul? - What is a Juul? A Juul is a closed-loop vape system. It consists of a battery\nand a pre-filled pod. Pre-filled pod is filled with e-liquid with a high nicotine volume. A Juul is very easy to use, all you do is put the\npod in and vape away. - Lots of high school kids\nwould never think of smoking. They've grown up with anti-tobacco ads. - [Girl] With this contract, I relinquish part of my freedom, to you. - [Kavitha] The scary thing\nis they don't think of vaping as smoking a cigarette or as smoking. - [Boy] Vaping can deliver\nnicotine to your brain. - It is true that Juuls don't have a lot of the toxic chemicals\nthat say a cigarette has, but a tiny Juul pod has the\nequivalent amount of nicotine that's contained in an\nentire pack of cigarettes. So, why would kids Juul? - They love the flavors. - I've heard a lot of kids say like, just gives them a quick buzz. They feel good after they do it. - You see the younger celebrities, they're holding a Juul in their hand and everyone on Snapchat\nwill like post videos of them juuling. They just find it as a way to be cool. - If you have money, you\ncan get it super easy. Just ask anyone. - One of the things that makes\nit really hard for educators is that Juuls are really easy to hide. - So, if I'm a student\nand not dressed like this, but if I have a pocket or if I, I put it right here. - Juuls look so similar to\nsay thumb drives, right? It's really easy to get confused and of course, kids\ntake advantage of this. So, a lot of students told me about a game they play in class, where a student can go up to a teacher, who has no idea what a Juul is, and say hey, I've got my\npresentation on this thumb drive, can I charge it on your computer, please? Because, I really need to have it. And then, they go ahead\nand charge their Juul on the teacher's computer\nand teachers have no idea. - It's very tricky, it's\nmade to be very tricky, to trick us, so it's therefore\ndifficult as teachers to know if they're actually vaping. - So, what's a teacher to do? Here is some of the things you can look for in your classroom. - So, your typical high\nschool bathroom, right? - Frequent or long bathroom breaks. A lot of kids go to the bathroom and then they hang out juuling. In fact, it's become so common, that schools across\nthe country have either cut down on the number of\nbathrooms that are open, teachers may monitor the bathroom, sometimes even principals. - You might have five or six kids hanging out in here with\nthe door closed and vaping. - Watch out for kids who cover\ntheir face with their hands, who sometimes have sleeves\nnext to their nose, who put their head down often, and maybe they just hide,\nthey're teenagers, right? But it could be that\nthey're vaping in class. A principal I spoke to said one of the most\neffective methods he used was really involving parents. So, for example, he didn't just talk to\nkids about the problem, he had after school seminars\nwhere he would invite parents and then it grew even bigger, it wasn't just parents, he actually invited the entire community, so that there were lots of\nsets of eyes on his students. And parents are still really influential in their teen's life, I mean just listen to what this one kid, Zane, said to me. - My momma don't play that. (kids laughing) It's that simple. - [Kavitha] Your mom is a very smart one. - Yeah, my mom would kill me too.", "wYcPnFoQjT4": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real maddie

guys look how beautiful this is and so the battery is this in itself absolutely beautiful this wooden grip here then you've got the button here and then you'll insert the you'll insert the cartridge through this up there and so this is where you can kind of get into the actual area it's pretty simple just to twist it on um when it comes to the charging port i forget where it is oh i'm sorry it's a twist on so you'll plug in the charge you'll plug in the usb and then you'll twist on the back side right into here magnetic super dope that is pretty freaking cool so for now let's turn it on fun two three four five we got three it's on green all right this means that we can dive into the leaf works cured resin so super excited uh when it comes to leaf works they're based in wenatchee washington it's in eastern washington it's about two hours or so away from seattle they are well known for using single source they grow and cultivate their own flower and then they put it into their own oil they are truly soiled to oil and the single source difference here on the back all leaf works products are single source meaning they are made from 100 leaf works grown cannabis this single source production allows leaf works to deliver products that are consistent clean and terpene focused from soil to oil super dope uh only cannabis no additives no botanical terps no cutting agents no heavy metals no pesticides cultivated by leafworks at leafworks on twitter instagram youtube facebook uh all that it's absolutely beautiful absolutely look at the color on that resin there so let's dive right in we're gonna do a one hit review i'm gonna talk about it give you guys an idea of the taste and the flavor and then i'll hit it again and give you guys a score out of 10. it's very important with the vapes that you do hit it more than once because the first hit might be a little bit extra terpy whereas the second hit or the third hit might be a little hot difference and so you want that balance perspective per usual with these carts um you got the little rubber stopper here at the bottom you guys can kind of see a little bit of the live resin color absolutely beautiful this nice amber lightness i can't smell the terps i can't smell the terps through this right now but i definitely feel like it's gonna be a quality experience the strain that we're working with this is candy apple it is a sativa so all we do is put it right into here give it a couple twists it'll catch i did not over tighten it and now we're gonna rip it here we go one hit you y'all know the [ __ ] rules west coast will be tour baby so on this lower temperature you definitely get the best of the best when it comes to the terps it doesn't taste hot at all i can feel i feel like i'm taking a low temp dab and what's really cool about this particular product is the cured resin uh it is a flour based product i'm not sure in this case if they're using nug run or if they're using some trim or sugar trim or whatever the case is but the terps on this are very very noticeable uh you can taste every single bit of yup you can taste every single bit of the strain the candy apple it's sweet it's sour it's got this little bit of pineness to it and when you inhale it and exhale you get this nice earthiness like herby earthiness in the back of your mouth and so tastes just like weed it's fruity it's tasty it works second hit coming through let's go so again really consistent on the intake and the pull pushing the battery on this and ripping it extremely easy i like that there's various heat settings i think that's extremely important in the vape space you don't want a battery that has one consistent temperature distillate is best heated at a certain temperature live resin is best hit at a certain temperature i'm sure cure the resin is bested at a certain temperature at all various various boiling points various heating points so um i think overall between the vessel uh you know heating the heating the cartridge up and the cartridge performance you know i think we're having a very very high level premium experience the terps are shining uh i'm all very much already high i can feel my heart racing and my energy picking up um score out of 10 though i'm thinking cured resin you know it comes in that high chirping extract that vape space you know smell color taste potency you know the product appeal um i really enjoy the leaf works as a brand they've grown on me significantly significant quite quite a lot over the years to be honest they've made a significant improvement to what i believe is the coolness of their brand i think the product quality has always been there and this is a testament to that it's an incredible vape experience uh if you are used to buying a live resin cartridge or a sauce pen and you were to pick this up and it wasn't what you were normally buying you would not be disappointed with this and so because of that reason i 100 percent recommend it uh i like the presentation and the appeal i think this fits in with the washington market very well i'd like to see the terpene information on the back and some of the genetics information for the strain um i like the wall hangerness you know like you know for the hooks and and the shelf space in washington i could do without the sativa indica hybrids for those kinds of things but you know overall i think this is a for a cured resin high tripping extract um you know with the vessel here helping it out i think this is really close to a nine uh if not just a nine flat um you know read the full review i'll write up some of my notes and my full experience here and kind of share some more information on the article with respectmyregion.com but i think i'm going to settle in at a 9. i need some more terpene information i need some genetics information the candy apple is very much tasty the experience on this was very good highly recommended so let me know what you guys think in the comments give me some some of your thoughts make sure you go follow leafworks on instagram and all social medias of course respect my region too we got a lot of videos on the on the youtube right now so definitely go tap in this is jpeg here man coming at you guys live west coast weed tour review i got the vessel cured resin vape cart one gram high terpene extract make sure you guys go check it out in washington i'll see you guys down the road peace", "TcBfBuU86Q4": "[Music] welcome back to the channel ladies and gentlemen I am Matt today we are gonna check out the Veeck aero kit now funny story about this pod it did come out a couple months ago as Veeck vee k then i believe some big tobacco company called them on it said it was too close to one of their names it was kind of ridiculous and so now they've rereleased it with the III k in here ok this is a pod system that's actually really freakin nice-looking it looks like a higher-end type of pod system this is what your packaging is going to look like so inside you do have a QC certificate and a user manual a warning card your device an extra pod and a micro USB charging cable that's inside this box obviously and for extra plugs for the device it's this things about a hundred and one millimeters long about 25 millimeters wide made up of zinc alloy obviously the pot is plastic here and then you have these leather panels it feels like real leather I'm not certain but it definitely feels that way says Veeck right there arrow right there micro USB charge port Lee right there another little hole right there I believe that is for airflow and then you have this light indicator on the bottom now this thing has a 360 milliamp hour battery let's go ahead and take a look at the pods these pods hold two MLS of liquid they have a 1.2 ohm horizontal coil inside with cotton wicking there's what your mouthpiece looks like pretty narrow chimney in there obviously you need to pull this sticker off before use and you do have contacts and a couple magnets on the bottom in order to fill this you got this little plug right here it's kind of hard to get your nail in there there we go it's not attached to the pot unfortunately like I said they do give you a for extras though and I'm going to go ahead and fill this on up and then on these plugs there's that little down arrow that goes points towards the bottom of the pie and then you put this guy in like so you want to obviously let this sit for a minute or two let those wick saturate and then if you see right there there's an angle on the pod so this only goes one way it matches up with that angle you put your pot in that light will blink at you and I might as well just show you the manual here so you understand what the lights do no power red light when it's charging the light will flash when it's fully charged it to white light red light when there's only 10 to 30 percent battery blue light when there's 30 to 70 percent battery and white light when it's above 70 percent okay so that light will turn on when you puff it as far as size comparisons go here it is next to the Caliburn it's this is a little wider the Caliburn is taller the Caliburn has a bit more battery life and thickness wise this way this way the Caliburn is a bit thicker and here's the black one I've been using this also comes in a multitude of other colors only thing I wish is that this had a little more battery life all right let's go ahead go up top vape these and talk about them a little more all right here's the week arrow pod 25 milligram Knicks all in here let's vape it also check out the light when I'm baby a very warm vape off of this very very nice warm vape definitely on the warmer side when it comes to pod systems the flavours nice because it is warmer obviously it's a very satisfying V but the draws a bit on the loose side for my liking it's that looser MTL draw kind of well it's compared to where'd it go where did it go oh it's on my desk let's check out the Caliburn very similar drop I mean the mouthpieces are a little bit different so it's a different sensation but it's a very similar draw you get a similar amount of airflow so if you've already purchased a Caliburn and you like this kind of draw you're gonna like this draw as far as heat goes between the two this one's a little tiny bit warmer actually kelly burns no slouch in the flavor and weren't Department either but this one's like I said it's one of the warmer pod systems out there okay so anyway let's talk pros and cons cons first definitely got to mention the battery okay it would have been nice if they at least had like a 500 milliamp hour battery in this or something like that as is it might get you through all day especially if you have a higher nicotine liquid in here and you're not puffing it as often but don't be shocked if you're gonna have to charge this but you can vape while charging so keep that in mind and it does charge up pretty fast under an hour another con for me like I said is is a bit on the loose side for what I like with MTL I know there's a big market out there that likes this kind of draw same with the caliber the Caliburn is a great device as well and it's that looser MTL drop but for me I like a bit tighter vape the only other thing I kind of wish is that you could turn this light off while it looks cool if you're out in public or a darker area you're trying to stealth vape I mean yes you can cover this up but it's a pretty bright light it's a pretty big light here okay so keep that in mind I kind of wish there was a way to turn that off or dim it or something just in case you were trying to be stealthy alright as far as pros go like I said super warm vape very very flavorful very very saturated these pods have lasted me a pretty long time I can get like five to seven days off of one pod so I have no issue with that it's a very smooth draw as well and one of the biggest pros I have with this is just its looks the build quality and its looks it looks kind of like a techie type of product it looks higher-end than most pod systems out there I really dig it I also find that the mouthpiece is very very comfortable the pods fit in nicely no play at all okay those magnets work well the pods have never come out on me so all-in-all for 25 bucks which is what this goes for plus you get a second pod which is a pro I think it's definitely worth it if you like the looser MTL style vape now you can buy this off of eeks website vei kay and you can buy all the pods and stuff there I think there's a few retailers out there that have it in stock - like I said if you like looser MTL warm vapes you don't mind this battery size I definitely think it's worth picking up if you like the look of it and you like pod systems alright let's end it there folks that about wraps it up until next time thanks for watching suck my mod", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you enjoyed this review of the heavy hitters solvent free concentrated cannabis wax pens if you did please hit the like button and subscribe to roughhouse Studios for more cannabis culture videos made just for you this is mad at roughhouse studios thanks for watching [Music]", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "-Z_TWB9QcMg": "thank you for visiting this video today this is going to be a short video on how to troubleshoot your device from our many years of experience doing this both in the store and personal we're gonna try and take it through from the beginning to the end and hopefully it'll save you either a trip or a phone call to kind of figure out what's going on these are all pretty basic things that might go wrong with your battery okay first off okay if your battery isn't working or you think it's not working and you're vaping on it nothing's happening I want you to notice that if you hit the button and it's just not lighting up your battery might be turned off and for most batteries it's just a 5 click on and off so I'm going to click it 5 times and then I should be good yeah we're rolling because I can hear that that sizzling something for some people you are listening for that sizzling sound nothing's wrong with that at all it's just burnin juice okay so if it's still not working and your battery is turned on and the tanks just not firing don't tighten the tank down any tighter if it's not making connection what you need to do is this is pretty simple if you can notice right here in the center there is actually a connector pin and that's what makes connection with the battery just from daily use putting tanks on and off that pin can actually become compressed down into that rubber and if that happens all you need to do to make a better connection just take a standard paperclip or whatever you have on hand something that's got a little bit of strength in it and it's nice and thin and we're just going to take it and we are going to lift that post up out of the rubber just enough to make a better connection No there you go and that's about how far you want to push it up and that will solve a lot of problems right there and now when you put the tank on you will notice it tie it in a little bit it'll give a little bit you'll have more resistance when it tightens but still don't over tighten the tank to the battery because if you do you'll just cause a lot of leakage and that's another thing if you are noticing that there's just a ton of liquid and the battery and it's just flooding all out around here you've probably over tightened your tank to the battery and compress that wick and seal on the inside and everything's just leaking out the bottom which is also how you can compress the weight or compress that out and connect your pin on the inside see I'm just barely screw so now that I've pulled the post up and put the tank back on you can hear it sizzling so we are all working now now if there's still something wrong with the battery and you just can't get it to work or you feel like it's not charging or anything like that it might be an issue with the charging cable it's when you plug in the battery to the charging cable and it does not do this bring it in so we can test it and see which component is going wrong it should when you plug in the battery it should go red and the light should stay on and then in between four hours and a full night it should go to green letting you know it's charged if it's just staying green all the time if it's showing you orange reviewing something funky bring it in and we'll actually figure out which piece is going on and it might be the wall adapter or it might be the cord and we can only really diagnose that in the store okay so now I'm going to take the battery off and if there's something else wrong with the battery the it could be these batteries do have actually a timer cutoff okay if I hold this button for longer than about five seconds generally just gonna keep on holding it because you know you're taking a big long draw off this battery at this time it's gonna flash a couple times which a lot of people know that means a battery is dead and it's gonna shut off but in just a few they'll be ready to vape again and that is just from people taking really long draws and the batteries timing out it's a safety precaution to avoid it doing that all you have to do is while you're vaping just cycle the button every second or so that way you can get those nice big long lung kits that you're looking for and if there's still something going on funky with the battery bring it and we can figure out what's going on with it and that's pretty much everything for the battery that you might be experiencing okay everything else might be with the tank if you're noticing that you're just getting a lot of gurgling and bubbling think about the last time you put a q-tip down it if you haven't put a q-tip down it in awhile you might have a lot of extra condensation that's making it act like it's flooded and all you have to do is take the q-tip run it down the post until you feel it stop turn it upside down so you can let gravity do all the work and then all of the extra condensation that might have been flooding your tank will be on that q-tip this tank I can tell it's been a little while since it's been heated but now when I hit this it's probably going to hit like a champ if you're still having some issues gurgling there's probably something going on inside of the tank if it's not broken okay so I'm going to take a fresh tank and I'm going to take it apart when you take apart a tank there are a few things that you're looking for okay most of it has to do with this wick and coil this piece right here okay I want you to notice that there are three seals okay there's one on the bottom one in the center and one on top as well as little tiny wick here if you're wet if your wick and coil is screwed in that is the first most important thing always make sure that waking coil is screwed in if you're missing any four of these pieces right here most importantly the one on top this top gasket you will have a lot of leakage you will have bubbling up into the you'll be basically vaping juice or if you're if you've lost this this little link right here you'll be vaping straight juice and if you're missing either these bottom seals you'll probably have a little bit of leakage seals are definitely there for a reason and if you have lost any of them if you've lost the wick or the gasket on top of the link you just need a new wick and we do sell the seals for the base in this store so if it's if everything's there and is looking good then you shouldn't have any problems with that something else must be going on okay if you're still having issues more specifically that you just can't get it draw off this and it's really really tight make sure you've changed your wick and coil if you've changed your weekend coil within the last week and it's still giving you a really really tight draw there might be something else going on first thing you want to do is you want to check down this center post in the center post a lot of times we put down q-tips and we forget that the cue that somebody cotton comes off and that gets left in this center tube so that might be blocking your airway or just from something else of your pocket or your purse or something that's gotten launched in there so just look through that and make sure that's straight through and you can see all the way through it if it's still tight what it might be is when I put this together there are air holes on this okay you might either be covering these air holes when you vape because it's really easy to check your finger placement if while you're holding the button you've also got another finger somehow covering one of those holes you're gonna get it much you're gonna get a much tighter vape or the holes might actually be clogged up and if they're clogged up all you have to do is actually I've got a straight pin on me all you need to do is just take a standard straight pin or whatever you have that's small enough to do it and just take it and poke it through all of the holes and there are three air holes on this because a lot of times went in debris just from being in your pocket will get stuck in those air not let you fake through it okay if you're still having issues you do have to take into consideration this is a personal vaporizing device and they go through a lot of wear and tear us ladies we put them in our personal and put everything on top of them and gentlemen you put them in your pocket and you sit down and you might have cracked a tank or you might acredited out the battery somehow if you notice around the battery that it's not working and you've noticed that it's starting to pull apart right here then that means at some point in time that batteries have been pulled apart and if you've seen any wires or anything and stuck it back together and it still works it might not last you forever it's definitely gonna be something that at any point in time it can ground out or if you've noticed or if you remember having one good drop it might actually damage some of the components on the inside he might have grounded out your battery so that could be a reason why your battery is not working and if your tank is still just leaking and you can't find the source look around some of the places where cracks get ahead and I know specifically on this tank right here they get hit right here along the chrome lines to where you can't see them and they start to pull apart and that's where the leakage is but other than that I can't really think of anything else that you might need to know about troubleshooting this if you do have any other questions or concerns definitely drop by the store and lokan will be able to figure out what's going on with that but in conclusion we are open 7 days a week if you are still having any issues with troubleshooting or I've been Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. we also have our website which is www.hyken.com into this store because we can't actually see what's going on all over the phone other than that have a great day I hope you're having a good baby experience and vape on you", "dRhuWyCBo80": "[Music] [Laughter] [Applause] hey guys Rylan favor where today I'm going to show you how to fill your cartridge and insert it onto your pin with our cartridge you'll notice a blue rubber piece at the top remove the stopper fill it with your favorite oil once you're finished filling the cartridge replace the blue rubber stopper then take the cartridge screw it onto the end of the pin but don't screw too tight because it can mess up the functionality of the pin and you're ready to roll", "5wVWXw_sawY": "hi my name's Peter with air vapor systems and today we're gonna focus on how to properly fill the C cell m60 cartridge now it's available in a 0.5 ml or a 1 ml a cartridge size we internally refer to it as the c6 cartridge so if for any reason you give us a call and you are looking for this cartridge you can refer to it as the m60 or the c6 cartridge however it is very tricky to fill there are a number of small details that you must pay attention to to properly fill this cartridge without any issues so I'm going to separate this video into two different portions the first portion we're going to identify the proper technique to fill this cartridge as well as the tools and techniques used to cap it now in the second part of this video what we're going to go into is more of a troubleshooting mode when we show you some of the common mistakes that can happen why they happen and how to prevent them so without any further ado let's begin [Music] so to begin explaining how to fill the m60 cartridge we will first review all the parts and identify each piece of the m60 so you know how they all fit together and what order they should be put together that's very important to note these should be placed together in a particular order number two I'm going to identify the tools that you'll need to put them together two of these tools are a blunt tip syringe as well as an arbor press now this Arbor press is maybe something that you have not seen or you may not have however it is available from air vapor for under $300 and it helps greatly with consistently and reliably capping these cartridges in fact it's recommended by the factory again we have these arbor presses for sale but it's highly recommended that you use an arbor press to cap these cartridges so that you can consistently cap them properly now to begin let's identify the pieces here of the m60 cartridge it actually consists of four pieces the two main pieces are here the cartridge body as well as the cartridge tip now the cartridge tip is available in two styles you have a round or a flat mouthpiece tip available these other two pieces that you see out here to the side this piece here is the mouthpiece cover it goes on after the mouthpiece has been mated to the cartridge body and this other piece over here is the bottom thread cover for the cartridge body this also goes on after you have maded the tip and the body together so these pieces last these pieces first to begin filling the cartridge properly you will first notice that the m60 here is a side fill cartridge meaning that you're not going to fill the center post in the middle although it may be tempting what you're going to do is you're actually going to take your blunt tip needle and insert it into the side of the cartridge between the center post and the the inner rim you're gonna want to use a blunt tip needle for this because blunt tip needles are not sharp and it will prevent you from injury once you have your material loaded inside of your blunt tip syringe you will fully insert it all the way into the cartridge and for this syringe I am using a 15 gauge blunt tip needle that a 15 gauge needle is somewhat wide and allows me to easily fill this using thick material I will push my material into the cartridge and begin slowly raising the needle as it fills taping taking proper care not to fill this past the bottom edge of the metal top metal collar that is the fill line for this cartridge the bottom edge of this metal collar is really where you should fill this too and not above the explanation for that will be later in this video then you're going to take the mouthpiece and place it onto the cartridge and you won't have to press it in hard all you need to do is place it onto the cartridge so that it seats it self partially and then you're gonna take this cartridge and put it into the jig for this Arbor press then all you'll do is take the handle for the arbor press and push the tip all the way down until it fully seats into the cartridge body you want to make sure that this kind of bottom edge here of the tip makes fully to the top edge of the cartridge once that is done you now have a fully filled and capped cartridge and then you're just basically going to add the two other portions onto it which is the mouthpiece cover as well as the bottom thread cover to complete your cartridge and there you have it a full m60 C cell cartridge okay now that you have seen how to properly fill in cap the m60 cartridge we're going to move into the second portion of this video where I describe to you some troubleshooting scenarios and explain the actual physics of how the m60 cartridge fits into itself so that you can see in diagnose any issue that may arise during filling now the m60 cartridge has a very unique capping system what it features is a tip that pushes down into the body and remains in place through friction the way it creates this friction is by having a reinforced rim around the top of the cartridge body and then a tapered plastic tip at the bottom of the tip so that when you place this taper tip into the cartridge body and push it together friction causes it to mate to itself and hold it in place much the same way that friction acts to keep these two plastic cups connected together now if you've ever pulled two plastic cups out of the dishwasher or maybe out of your cupboard you might notice sometimes these things can get really hard to separate well this action where two plastic cups fit together and don't come apart is the exact same way that the m60 cartridge fits to itself you have a bottom cup here with a reinforced rim this top cup has a tapered bottom to it and as I insert the first cup into the second you have this tapered bottom eventually widening out all the way until it meets this reinforced rim and with just a slight press down further friction begins to engage around the tip holding the two together now the two ways in which you can counteract that friction is by either a over filling this cup or by be getting material on the inside rim of it let me show you how this can occur so as you can see on this cup I have a fill line drawn on it this fill line is meant to resemble the bottom edge of this metal collar the top collar around the m60 that is the filled line for the m60 cartridge whether it's in a point 5 ml size or a 1 ml size the bottom of the metal collar at the top that bottom edge is your fill line do not fill past that edge or what I'm about to describe to you will occur however I'm going to explain it just so you can see it just a little bit better and see it in action using these two cups now to represent the material that I'm going to use I'm just gonna have this right here this is basically vegetable glycerin with a little bit orange food coloring in it I'm using it solely so that you can just see what's happening in these plastic cups now I have drawn a fill line on this Cup as I mentioned before and that is to represent the fill line on the m60 or the bottom edge of the top metal collar now when I take my material and I pour it into this cup and I do not pour it past the fill line making sure to not overfill what happens is I get a great seal because there's nothing preventing me from or nothing preventing the cup from grabbing itself and from friction engaging around the rim in the taper tip and you can see because the I only filled up to the fill line the material did not start creeping up the sides nor did it overfill however let's see what happens when you do overfill so I'm going to take this out here it's dripping a bit but let's overfill this just attach shall we now this situation here is meant to basically replicate what would happen if you were to fill the m60 cartridge past the bottom edge of the top collar basically essentially over filling it what happens when you overfill it let's insert this cup down again and see what happens hopefully you can see there that the liquid starts to rise up the sides as the cup is placed into this overfilled vessel here displaces the oil forcing it to go up the side so when that happens what you don't see is the oil starts actually pushing back in wanting to raise this cup up right now that is essentially what happens if you overfill the m60 what will happen is the oil or the liquid that you have placed in there will begin to push back against the tip as you push the tip down pushing the tip which will then force the tip to pop back up on you now if you really try to force the tip down this is what's gonna happen hopefully you can see all of this material starting to pour out the sides of the cup what happens now is basically this this VG juice does two things number one it's providing pressure against the cup so it's pushing the top cup out but because I've now displaced so much oil that is pouring out at the top what happens is it prevents friction from engaging around the rim to hold the cups in place essentially what the this juice has done is it's overflowed and it started lubricating the rim when it lubricates the wim there's no way that it's gonna hold you see it just comes right out because there's no way for friction to engage this is what happens on the m60 cartridge when you overfill it you either have the oil pushing back against the tip or you drive oil up the sides thus lubricating the entire rim and preventing friction from engaging to lock down that tip that's the tip pushes up and out or it easily comes out during use in order to properly seat the m60 cartridge you have to first ensure basically three things happen number one don't overfill it because if you overfill it this is what will happen you're going to drive oil up the sides or you're going to set the oil or liquid against the tip and it's gonna push it out number two try not to get while you're filling even if you can have if you avoid over filling what you're gonna want to do is avoid getting any material around the inner edge of the m60 so what that means is when you're coming in here with your syringe and you're filling this cartridge what you want to do is when you pull out your syringe do it cleanly try not to get any oil trailing into the inner rim of this cartridge or else that oil or that liquid will act as a lubricant against the rim and prevent the top from completely seating inside there and holding together that's the tip will pop out and third the most important thing which we reviewed in our vision previously in this video is to use an arbor press an arbor press will allow you to fully seat that tip all the way down and you're gonna want to make sure that the bottom edge of your tip is seated fully to the top edge of the cartridge body this is usually only consistently achievable if you use an arbor press I've heard of people with strong hands pushing them together I think hands get tired after a while and a press like this is going to be a much more reliable way for you to see if those cartridges there you have it if you have any questions please do not hesitate to give us a call or send us an e-mail which will be reflected below and you can always drop a comment on this video and we will respond as quickly and as thoroughly as possible thank you for listening we'll see you next time [Music] [Music]", "1Q17dd0N7qw": "what up guys this is Brennan from vapor slide comm and today I'm gonna do a troubleshooting video on the dreaded red lights whenever you see those red lights that means that your cartridge and your vapor slide have lost connection there is a small spring in the bottom of here to ensure that you have a good connection and it has a little bit of give every time you put a cartridge in there but sometimes the connection needs adjust it and I'm going to show you an easy fix for that if you're using one of our cartridges they magnetically snap right into place like that and then use the preheat function that'll show you that you have perfect connectivity and that your core is heating up and then you can go ahead and hit it if you ever have connection issues with our cartridge just twist it slightly even just a little bit and try again and then your preheat should work generally these connection issues are just because your cartridge and your vaporizer are in a funky alignment and you just need to twist it a small amount to make it work again then when you're using a standard 510 cartridge all you need to do is screw it all the way in just make sure that the cartridge is going all the way down to the threading sometimes the threading feels a little tight when these are brand new and though that's just new threading and we have actually been free threading them to make them feel better on the next batch but for now if you get the red light with a 5-10 cartridge like that simply screw it in if it feels a little tight just go nice and slow until you're secure and then you can kind of back it out a little bit go back in and then you should fix the problem and have a good connection don't forget your paper slide as a one-year warranty for any issues that also if you have any problems with your slide feel free to let us know and we will get you a brand new one all right guys thank you very much", "bD6ACtDcGSQ": "[Music] today we're gonna focus on how to fill the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "8Kkh27wL3pw": "today I'm gonna show you how to probably put on your atmo blue mask it's really simple so when you have your mask you have your neck strap and you have your head strap and you also have this string tie right here refer for this video we're gonna call it our little bean squeeze alright you're gonna take this part right here and you know loop it through this little loop right here along with the bean squeeze alright once it's through take your mask take the neck strap put it around your neck now you're gonna have to do this several times before you find your ideal position for you where it's super comfortable on your neck take the head strap put on the back your head make sure it's cut and you get to go and that is how you put on your atmo blue mask [Music]", "Iu_RwFwgIJ0": "hey guys Dustin here from my freedom smokes calm do a quick video today on probably one of the most popular products that we sell here at my freedom smokes that is the ego with ce4 650 mah blister pack starter kit and it's easy to see why this is so popular basically you know it's a blister pack so it's in a retail package we have actually have a lot of wholesale customers that buy this from us and resell it in their stores so it's because it's got a really nice packaging to it it does come with one 650 ml battery you have a CF or clearomizer and a USB charger so it has everything that you need to get rolling in terms of vaping right away and it's relatively cheap we sell it at 14.95 for the booster pack starter kit at my freedom smokes calm you can find it in the electronic cigarette starter kits category there and that makes it a really great deal because these batteries alone I mean these these are actually variable voltage batteries but a similar 650 mah battery just by itself is normally you know 1595 just that piece so then you're you're basically buying a battery getting the clearomizer and a charger for free whenever you get this little kit so and it works really really well it is not a name-brand it is kind of a store brand that we sale it's not Joyetech it's not smoke tech it's not vision anything like that it's just a generic brand but we've gotten absolutely outstanding reviews about it it works really well the batteries are holding up for extended periods of time the Chargers are doing great the c4s are even doing great so really good starter kit I'm going to kind of go through some of the features of it here real quick kind of show you how to use it how to fill it up and what you need to know to get rolling so if you take a look here just took it out of the package it is just your standard 650 mah battery but the clearomizer on it and unscrew the clearomizer own screws right off the end there and you see right now it's off 1 2 3 4 5 out of 6 times and that's the 5 click function to turn it on so now you see it's on and is actually lighting up red might look a little orange on the camera there but it's actually lighting up red which is the highest voltage setting like I said this is a variable voltage battery to cycle through the voltage settings really simple 1 2 3 and it goes to the next setting green is actually the lowest setting so it goes from red which is the highest down to green and now you start from the lowest setting I think is 3.2 volts then 1 to 3 changes to blue that's the mid setting middle setting that's 3 point 6 volts and then 1 2 3 and we're back at red which is I think it's 3.8 folds you have to check the the product description on that one let's take it back down to green since we're just getting started with it here and then here's the charger you know just a simple basic short wire charger plug it into any USB outlet or get an adapter you get a wall adapter with a USB outlet on it if you want to plug it into the wall to charge it it just simply screws right on the end here it's not plugged in right now but normally that would blink or light up this will turn its normally green it'll turn red when you put the battery on it whenever it turns green again then that means it's fully charged and you can take it off but it's that's the charger fairly simple fairly easy to use now the the clearomizer this bench that we got actually came with flat tips a lot of people out there prefer the flat tip some prefer the round this batch came with flat tips we do sell round onde tips for the c4 clearomizers if you prefer a round tip you do have to purchase that separately from if you get one from this batch now a lot of times whenever we get new batches they may come in with round tips our flat tip we don't usually specify because we have a ton of customers that like each one so either way they they send it to us we're okay with it and we do have the replacements for those so just your general c4 clearomizer here you can see the the gauge on the side there goes up to one point six milliliters it's got a long wick in it actually several long wicks that's like four of them in there the hang down and just soak up that juice and bring it up to the heating coil right there in the center go ahead and take this mouthpiece off just unscrews from the top just like so so you can set the mouthpiece down and then if you take a look inside it's a nice open I've been setting with the tube right there in the center whenever you fill this up you want to try to keep the juice from getting in that tube that tube is actually the airflow pathway so any juice that gets into that center tube is actually just going to run straight through out the bottom or if you're unlucky enough if you will suck it straight into your mouth which if you've done that before you know it tastes horrible so just be careful whenever you're filling it up not to get any juice in that tube the best way to do it have seduced right here I'm going to fill this one up best way to do it fill up with some ry4 juice here just kind of lean it to the side here and then just drip the the liquid in and it will cascade right down the side of that chamber and fill it up try to go too fast here and some in there keep going and you really want to fill it up right to where those wicks come out of that center post if you go much above that and I went a little above it if you go too far above that it'll actually cause it to flood the clearomizer a little bit so you want to want to stick with filling it up right to where those wicks come out of that center post it'll be okay for this lunch of them just just testing it out here and then just screw the mouthpiece back on and that's it you're done it's full it's ready to use so now let's screw it back on the battery and we're ready to give it a vape all right let's let's try it out here after you see that I mean it got got a good bit of vapor out of it let's turn it up to this middle setting and give it another try Wow yeah that put out a ton of vapor uh yeah and then scope this high setting it might be a little too high but let's try it anyway whoo yeah that's that's a ton of vapor yes I mean you can see this is a really an outstanding performer for the money I mean it can't be beat and you're talking if you were to buy all of these pieces separately you're looking at you know 15 bucks for for the battery alone plus another four dollars for the clearomizer and about four and a half dollars for the for the charger so you're saving a lot of money by by getting this separately you're saving about eight and a half bucks there so or about getting this all in this blister pack starter kit so then an outstanding deal and it's just we call it the blister pack starter kit I think the actual product name is ego with ce4 650 mah blister pack starter kit it's it I believe it's the last product in the electronic cigarette starter kits section of our site so go there check it out this WWF freedom smokes calm and hope you guys have a great day", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "E4nCLxr0ijo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's come to my attention that a lot of people are having issues with their ego Evod style pen type batteries with the Pens not firing the tanks this can be caused by a couple different things the solution I'm going to show you today is the connection from use of the battery over time or tightening it too tight on the Chargers tanks etc will cause the center pin in the top of the pen to recede back into the battery there's a quick and easy solution if you're pushing the fire button on your pen style battery and it's not firing your tank I'd suggest first looking at the center pin and I'm going to show you today how to how to readjust the center pin in the upper part of the battery so that it makes a solid connection again there's a couple different tools you can use for this you can use either a small screwdriver something sharp and pointy that's quite narrow I've chosen to use a set of pointed tweezers they happen to have around now the problem with these ego batteries Eagle Evod stuff style batteries is this center pin inside the ego battery itself that small round part right there like I said from tightening it on to the charger too tight or you have your ear Cardo style tanks this is a dripper a small dripper that I like to use on Evod batteries once in a while it's got those the threads that fit on the inside of the ego battery and this one doesn't have like a stop prevention for me to stop me from screwing it in too far thus thus causing this pin to recede into the battery too far and then the Evod tanks ceasing to fire on these batteries now this is quite an easy solution what you're going to want to do is on the outside of this pin is enough room just enough room to get your pointy object in there and what you're going to want to do is just find the edge of that pin you're just gonna want to slightly pry back on on whatever you're using causing it to kind of teeter-totter back and forth and come up and you can see how that center pin is now moving you're just gonna slightly work your slowly work your way around the outside of it and you want to be really careful just to not put too much pressure on this because you don't want to have this severed from the battery connection whatsoever you're just gonna slowly work your way around work your way around and once you made I don't know a full rotation you're just going to want to you're just going to want to check your fit with with a tank and just make sure that it's making a good enough connection for you so that tank is firing successfully and all I did was pull up the center pin on that", "rmxwnuTRMiw": ">> Tristan Ambat: About 80% of the people\nthat come in here are mostly beginner vapers, people who come in,\nwanna quit smoking. They saw us either on a news broadcast or\nsaw us in an article. A good 20% of our customers,\nthat's steadily growing as the days go by, is what we would classify as more\nof the hobbyist level of vaping. And with that comes more\nexpensive e-cigarette models as well as what we\ncall rebuildable atomizers. With rebuildable atomizers, what they\ndo is you basically make your own version of the coil that's built into the\ntanks that are inside the e-cigarettes. That way you get a more custom resistance. With rebuilding, a lot of people would\nlike to go lower than the standard resistance, which is about 1.2 ohms,\n2.2 ohms. That way it sends more heat to the coil\nallowing you to get a better experience from vaping such as better heat, better\ntaste, that and one of the biggest things, bigger vapor, or what the community\nwould refer to as clouds. All right, basically, you would take\nyour atomizer and you would open it up. Right here you see\nthe base where right now, what I have built is two coils and cotton. What you would do on these is unscrew\nit and then remove these coils. They're usually held in with screws and through these little\nholes inside these posts. >> [MUSIC] >> Tristan Ambat: So if you can see, there's little holes right there\nthat you just slip your wires into. What I'm building right\nnow is a single coil. With a single coil,\nthere's only one coil in the base. >> [MUSIC] >> Tristan Ambat: The benefits\nof having more than one coil would equal more flavor, more throat hit,\nmore vapor, and of course more heat. But with that, you have to be careful\nbecause your resistance can run too low. The important thing that people need\nto know about resistance is ohms. And with ohms, there comes Ohm's law. The lower you go in resistance, the more\namps you're running off your battery. We go down here, screw both the leads on,\nmake sure they're nice and tight. Take this out, snip these two leads,\nand screw that last screw down. >From here we check our ohms. This is what we call an ohm reader, it basically tells you what\nthe resistance of your coil is. So on here I have a 0.8 ohm coil. Next thing I'll do is take my atomizer,\nput this on my mod and lock it. And then you'll see\nthe coil starts to glow. And what that's doing is just heating up\nmy coil just so I can get it nice and hot. That way I can get it to tighten up. And then eventually you'll see it\nstart glowing from the inside out, meaning that the heat is being evenly\ndistributed at the more consistent power. And the wicking material inside\nof it is actually cotton which basically wicks up the juice and\nallows you to vaporize it. There are people that say that they\ndon't like to use organic cotton, but the thing about cotton is 100% cotton\nis usually bleached to turn white. And with that, it also has pesticides\nin it which you don't to end up vaping. So people have to always make sure\nthey're using 100% organic cotton. >From here you just take out\none of the cotton balls and just take off a small amount. Roll this up into a wick and\nthen thread it right through. Take something to clip this and\nwrap it around. >> [MUSIC] >> Tristan Ambat: Afterwards, you want to\nmake sure that your cotton is nice and saturated. After that, make sure your mod fires up,\nget that vapor off of there. And from there, you just take your cap, get that hole to line up with your coil,\nand then you're good to go. >> [MUSIC]", "PXP64j29ueM": "what's going on baby family it's your boy fated Markie and today I'm gonna be comparing two things you guys I got a pod actually this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "hO8xN0JQGU8": "okay so to start out this podcast it is not flower it is not edibles it is not tinctures dabs it is not dabs thank you it is not dabs it is only vaporizers that will be vaporizer carts and the disposables yeah that will be banned in this shipping ban coming up because we still continually get so many so a dab safe a flower safe all those type of questions what did you say and so i'm just trying to address that at this point really my friends tell me [Music] 100 we get that question all the time which is understandable yeah i mean this was passed during the the coveted pandemic with covet uh legislation it kind of snuck in the cart ban into the the bill so it's understandable to be confusing not everybody has to be up on game like us yeah that is our entire purpose of being here but in short this is one of the last few videos we will make about this cart band before we're no longer able to sell out carts like mostly maybe like we had a run here of about eight months nine months almost a year really that we've been doing a lot of talking about a lot of cards with you guys a lot of the variants and that type of stuff but it seems like we'll probably be talking about this less and less we might only be talking about some of the companies that can really be found nationally at this point yeah exactly and um i'm i'm looking now we have exactly on this date today that we're recording this march 18th this may come out on march 19th but on march 27th it is officially the cart ban is officially beginning there's no longer um you're not allowed to ship cars through usps dhl ups fedex any of the anything you can't ship carts legally starting march 27th this doesn't apply to this lid this doesn't apply to the syringes that you fill up your own carts so nine days from right now will be the last time we'll be able to ship anything so definitely stock up we are um are we planning on doing a sale if we honestly ours are moving quickly enough and we can get them into shops that we might be able to sell if we do a sale i plan on putting this video out tonight it is a little bit later um but i if we do a cell i'm cool with something like for the next 24 hours but it would have to be something bulk it'd have to be like four for 90. yeah something like that something something along those lines is what i'm thinking what are you thinking yeah something like that but if you're at this point in the video and you're wondering if you get your hand on some good price carts we will we didn't plan on doing this so that's why we don't really have a discount prepared but just shoot us a dm or an email check out our web website cannabis cannabislibraryus.com yeah and um follow the links there to hit us up and see what type of deal we could put together for you because we're trying to bless people and i mean we need to get rid of our inventory as well realistically but at the same time i'm in the houston area we can still get them out into shops and things like that i mean hopefully at you guys shops right now it's not affected everybody's like our shop owner um has said that their price isn't going to go up well that's not really up to them yeah i promise to god if their supplier price goes up for whatever reason their price is also going to follow suit so and if unless your uh store is its own supplier which is very rare and then if you're in a illegal state probably impossible almost so definitely be on the lookout that kart band is fully enacted on march 27th what's today's date it's the 18th right now geez there we go eight nine days nine days yeah we're close as hell dude yeah we're under the ten mark we're almost at about the week mark so everybody hopefully what are we now we're not even around the 15th or first so what does this mean for um how cannabis is going or the trend and which candidate does this have any indication on that because this law really wasn't made for cannabis because i even had to explain that to someone today which with good understanding a lot of people think that this law and the way kind of even that we're framing it and talking about it is that it's a ban on delta eight but it's really a ban on the shipping of vaporizer products so do you think this has any indication and kind of the motion that the us's heading in uh no i wouldn't say just because like you mentioned it it was mainly based on nicotine vapes and carts and that was because the kids in middle schools were smoking them i think they even cited some elementary school kids were caught with some nicotine pens and so i think that was the main root of it and there's no mention of delta eight or thc or cbd specifically in the bill it just kind of says anything that's used to vape like create a vaporizer from a liquid is is illegal so any type of vape product to ship you're able to ship you know what i was thinking today about what i was scared of with this vape ban really is that this is going to drive things to become more local which is going to drive stores and local illegal dealers to be more inclined to like street dealers if you will to be more inclined to one cut it with whatever to get more carts out there and to force people to not have options like we currently have like right now we have all these online options that have reviews that have coas all that stuff but now people are going to be forced to buy what's next to them regardless of quality regardless of how much it can be trusted or i guess not forced because you don't have to buy smoking products yeah but you know what i'm saying like they'll be forced to buy what they can get their hands on essentially yeah i wouldn't say anything good comes from it because we also get the question a lot of oh you guys could just make syringes or make your own sell your own distillate which is possible that's also i guess a very small number of people know how to make their own carts using the syringes it's something that looks very easy yeah it's still very annoying yeah even with the terpene pre-terpened little syringes that you fill your own cart it's not as easy as it looks it's it's like dealing with hot candle wax yeah and it's like very very stringy it's hard to get perfect it's it's we've it's actually like the little instagram uh video you made with the dabs yeah it's like imagine putting that into a car exactly that's tough yeah that's not easy at all and along with what i was saying i'm scared that they're going to use it as a fear tactic so this is what i'm imagining and see if i'm tripping so somebody some kids high school kids or college kids want to get back on delta eight or they find out about delta eight so they start trying to do whatever they can to stretch that delta eight and these delta eight carts get out in the street and now the news articles for the first time people are hearing about delta eight is delta eight cards are hurting people see this is what happens when we legalize thc this type of [ __ ] happens not really with the full scope that all right none of this was happening when it was available online yeah two um that wasn't real delta eight in that cart and three we've still never seen marijuana legalization i'm just worried that that trend or that conversation is going to come up if something comes up that's not good and i guess kind of towards that being the trend i have noticed it seems like a big tobacco has come out swinging against cbd carts delta a cards thc cards whatever it may be because i've i've randomly seen and granted i do look at this stuff through my phone so it's suggested to me but yeah i've been suggested articles that are essentially blaming everything on on cannabis vapes they say uh children are getting addicted to them it's destroying kids lungs it's this and it's always framed and it's only the cannabis carts right that's what i'm saying and i'm really worried that some of these people with money is going to use this time to i wouldn't say that they're going to poison people but they'll jump on any slight news article to which could be inconsistent because i saw it with the kush but i remember when i told you my parents called me they're like this kush stuff is making people run around naked in the street because people were smoking like k2 and like and they were probably doing too much of that on the bath salts which i learned recently is the exact same thing as ketamine i didn't know that you know they're the same drug i'm not into the bath salt scene i didn't know that either but i watched a vlog and they were saying that ketamine and bath salts are the exact same drug yeah i had no idea but regardless like that type of stuff and then yeah there's def i feel like the propaganda machine is going to go into full swing because whenever tobacco loses a step yeah they're not even tobacco because i guess this is tobacco 2.0 with the the nicotine pens but the other ones being banned yeah that's what i'm saying so i think they're going to have to be the ones that uh they're now gonna try to frame it in against cannabis like oh you shouldn't ban us this is a problem of cannabis not a problem with the nicotine they're gonna lose that yeah yeah but they're long already yeah they're already starting to frame it like that's what i mean like it seems like there's some paid reporters who are putting articles into the mainstream opinion pieces that are framed in a way that is trying to frame thc as the bad guy in all of this to be to blame yeah which is isn't the case especially when you're considering the cbd carts like i don't know but like it's not going to be anything good you know whenever whenever bans happen whenever anything happens that creates an a need for another illegal market right especially in something that was legal today that won't be legal and much safer yeah it's a it's a very strange it's a it's a policy that makes no sense and it goes to show how much control big tobacco has in in the government because there's hey here's here's 10 million just sneak that in there escape people back on cigarettes man like it's a seven page bill get them addicted to cigarettes again and they'll come back home exactly exactly that's really what it is that's how it works okay you know it's just nobody's gonna read it nobody's gonna know and and the truth is nobody's gonna read it and nobody's gonna know and and like in these companies like see you telling me that these deleting cbd vapes are helping people not take more medication these medication companies like nah get the get that [ __ ] out of here too [ __ ] all that to meet people on this medication we need people smoking cigarettes and taking the medication to heal from the diseases that cigarettes cause yeah exactly and then that medication they can give them a side effect that they need the other medication exactly which leads that other side effect exactly and then we're going to tax them and charge them tough for like the all the medical bills at the end and then the grave absolutely like it's just you're not going to leave this life the reason i mean the reason it's full if you follow the trends the reason why cannabis is such a uh the reason why we're so behind in cannabis is because of the so many big industries would plummet except maybe fast food fast food should be riding the legalization train as hard as anybody yeah for sure fast food but you know big tobacco is going to take a hit even the vape big vaporizer whatever that is is going to take a huge hit once people legalize alcohol paper industry paper industry so you got alcohol paper and what else where there's got to be somewhere missing we're just talking those are huge ones though alcohol tobacco alcohol tobacco and paper firearms might even take a hit because cotton yeah another one because if this hemp like that hemp production it's just there's so many more things that you could do and have you seen how hip is like fire proof have you ever seen those videos yeah i've seen um if you insulate your house with it like that the concrete yeah like it can't burn yeah or it doesn't like it like it's it lights up but then it like fizzles out kind of immediately that shit's crazy dude remember when i was at the university of florida it was uh somebody was obsessed with hemp creek talking about how it was the future and he's right but yeah he's just one of those people that's too educated on the topic so he's not just [ __ ] it yeah the layman yeah i don't want to hear about this right now i don't want to hear about him cree right yeah exactly you're going through all the biology of it and why it works perfectly yeah can it build me a home yes is it cheaper yes is it more environmentally friendly yes i didn't really need to hear you say anything else that's cool with me but guys um regardless of who your vendor is regardless of who you get your carts from go get it go wipe them out right now because they're not going to be available too much longer definitely um about what nine days you said right nine days from so on march 27th so we got whenever you're watching this video if it's past the 27th well yeah you're [ __ ] well yeah [ __ ] definitely check out all your favorite cart brands check out us out legally lifted yeah cbd hemp library check all the channels out we got gp's free game on deck too oh yeah show support to all the the small businesses who are in the the cbd delta eight in the cannabis grind the cannabis grind is one that is very underrated because you're getting it from all angles you got the banks trying to ban you you got alcohol trying to ban you you got everybody trying to ban you got the paper industry you got the show industry gang bang you got dwight from the office trying to ban you they can't sell paper they can't have a business yeah so i mean we all we all out here fighting sell paper they can't have a show exactly there would be no office without paper so the legalization of cannabis would mean no office no office michael wouldn't do a job very underrated for a long time i mean i guess now not underrated it's not under anything underwater in my life i really didn't enjoy it until it was already completely done and i had 700 people come up to me i'm more parks right i [ __ ] with parks and rec too similar show though in terms of very very similar show but the nuances between the characters is like a whole different vibe in my opinion that's true but at the same time very similar show yeah like the setup it's amazing 30 rock is like 30 rocks in the exact same similar category of show but they're in like and hold it just in a different lane but it's the same like a lot of those shows like the same they figure a formula right in there personal relationship in the workplace regardless of what that workplace produces whether it's paper parks and recreation system or a major snl like tv show i think the the main distinction between parks and rec and office that i don't know if i've seen another show that i could think of off top is the the frame of talking to the cameras too like how they like they're acknowledging that the cameras are a part of the show yeah like in some i don't know many other shows like that those are really the only two i could think of oh there are other shows i can't think of i mean because we had kids shows that even used to do that with us that would like speak outside of the frame of the like realize that bernie mac oh yeah and they would kind of do that as like a split scene though right like bernie mac yeah like he would be explaining it was kind of like that but yeah but understanding it like just as a a god aspect like understanding that what's happening the nuances of the show outside of the show type [ __ ] yeah but i mean all classics r.i.p bernie mac oh yeah what [ __ ] i mean if you guys like delta 8 we know many of you do yeah if you like vaping it get it while you can and we're even hearing all of the big companies all of everybody's favorite companies are are going to stop selling them so people like maybe people just sell it past it like that's just not how it works like businesses don't take those risks like or else right now i mean obviously you can find anything you want online if you go look deep enough in the black market yeah but like in the open market that's why you can't just go online right now and google and get weed shipped to your house get mushrooms shipped to your house because like companies aren't going to take these risks like yeah there might be some and you might find some but it's not going to last too long guys so try to get it while you can and the sales are the best right now 100 yes it's actually if you're a consumer prime time to buy because everybody's trying to get these off including us so if if you are um into anything in delta let us know what your favorite type of consumption method is and if you would be the type of person that would be able to would be interested in having your own syringe that that you could fill up your card or take a dab out of or if you are a dabber let us know that you enjoy dabs yeah we're kind of keeping tabs on those things so we could know i guess how to keep the consumers happy yeah definitely we're running a a survey here you could say i don't think we have too much more to talk about in this video guys but get your delta eight as you need it but you don't have too much time if you want to buy it online so we always want to update you guys um we're just chilling having a good time trying to inform you guys hell yeah we always appreciate y'all coming through check us check us out on all of our channels but most importantly i would recommend going to cannabislibraryus.com yeah and that's like a it's our favorite space yeah it's our home base because youtube keeps banning us we have multiple channels they're always flagging this flagging that banning this now we have one more strike until we're permanently banned so cannabislibraryus.com will have our home base for all of our reviews our delta nine thc reviews we're gonna start a show we travel around and check out the cannabis culture worldwide oh yeah so um we're excited about that and follow us on cannabislibraryus.com and if you want anything about us it'll be on there for sure michelle yeah it's been another one it has peace [Music]", "2uwqcupoXIk": "here we have the pecs era thing pretty sweet pod it's empty these things are like $60 a pop so it'd be ideal to refill them and I'll show you how to easily take this off you need is some of these c-clip pliers so they can do this [Music] now they'll do this which is what we'll need so I'll show you these are a couple of taking apart first try taking the top part apart which is just a mouthpiece and it's hot on these two little things and then in theory you can syringe or push these plugs in and syringe from the top but it's kind of a pain in the ass and totally not ideal so then the second thing you can do is take the bottom piece out and it looks like this see how these little filters on each side like so sometimes it'll stay and then it just pops back in like so so I'm taking it out be careful so if you don't get enough pressure and then you pull this part out it'll pull these metal things with the wicks with it and then you'll get something that looks like this that's really pain to put back another thing I've noticed some of these cartridges gonna leak through the seal that's right around this edge there's a gasket right around there and when that happens you get all the filters or I'll get all soaked up with all the oil so this one's kind of useless too so now no syringe of some new oil I'm gonna fill it up touch this plunger [Music] there take that off and we can put this needle pour it on and we want to do is fill it up but not get it in the hole because then I'll just pretty much come out the mouthpiece good this is a 1 grand cartridge I didn't fill it all the way up as you can see and then we get the full cartridge plug around and test it up", "p2kL9EZnMQk": "yo wait hold up [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] because before we

between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "o4m-Ad5-fq4": "so sup everyone it's gonna be my first review on my garden I got me the triple og and 381 percent THC to house every D and C is that looks like already opened the packaging a

wonderfully ground them doesn't matter what string that's a big downer but for the price you can go wrong", "rIFOf4R1oyA": "you know what is going on YouTube welcome back to a quick little banger by your boy semi g-men so a question that I've been getting ass lately a lot men so you guys know that I've always upload a cartridge videos pata videos anything that has to do with a portable you know dabbing device then I'm pretty much using it because I'm always on the go I can never find a convenience to just roll down I mean sit down and roll one up you know or sit down and just heat up my mic to my banger or you know all that stuff so I always feel like I carry a cartridge or a pod with me at all times just because it's that convenient so but the question that I get asked a lot right is which one do you like better semi which one do you like better man you're always chief in this chief in that do you like cartridges better or do you like pods better and I was just like when when I saw that question I was just like wait hold on man I had to think about it I was like I don't know I don't know if I like cartridges or pods better you know I don't know which one I would choose on because I have had some really really amazing cartridges and then I've had some really really amazing pods you know and I feel like each one has their own you know up side to it so I think for today's video man we're gonna get down to the bottom of what I like out of a pod system and what I like out of a cartridge system and I guess so today though we are gonna be chiefing representing the 510 thread cartridge side we got imperial extracts this one right here is a lemoncello sativa and the main reason I wanted to put this one in is because lemoncello is one of those strains that is super freakin fire right now so I wanted you to give this one a shot shout out to imperial extracts mint for it you should handing this out to me and on the pot system side we got the big boy right here that's dizzy sitting on the nice big battery all right men shout out to Steve and I thought you know these two brands right here man they they make some really really good light resin so I chose some of the best ones that I could find and I just really want to see what what what makes it stand out more than the other all right guys so to start off I feel like let's start off with imperial extracts sitting that I think we're gonna put this out a three point five right lemoncello that's going what do I like about a 5-10 thread cartridge let's find out oh dude that is so smooth oh that libraries and hits though oh okay so off of that first initial hit I'm obviously not gonna base it off of the oil itself it's gonna be more about the cartridge and what I like about it so I think as the first thing the most obvious reason that I like a 5-10 thread cartridge over a pod would probably have to be you see this thing right here the battery man the fact that I could switch up my variable wattage is on a you know when I'm smoking if I tend that cartridge is something that is very very underestimated a lot of people do not know you know I preached this a lot when I'm doing cartridges and things like that but you have to if you feel like you're not getting the right amount of turps the right amount of flavor smoke whatever the cases the chances are you had to switch up the voltage side there go a little bit higher a little bit lower you know you go you have to find the sweet spot on a cartridge just so you can get that overall well you know smoke experience man when you're sitting there you're gonna get the the right flavor profile you're gonna get the Terps up smacking you get the smoke and I feel like when using a battery like this like this battery that has variable wattage right here on the down on the bottom I feel like that's a big upside to the 510 thread cartridges because men I I want it if I feel like it's not hitting enough I can easily turn it up and boom I'm getting smack because it feels like I just took a dab all right so that would be the first thing that I like about a 5-10 thread over a pot and next up on the list we got the stage right here like I said competing for the pod side and let's go ahead and take a little rip about this see what I like about the pod see what I like it but I don't like about it right choose or what I like over the 510 thread smackers dude I don't know it's dizzy so good but the imperial extracts man I think that lemoncello that they made Veneto bro finito so what I like about a pot I feel like what the thing that stands out to me the most about ippolit system it's just about the convenience and the sleek design that they give you I feel like that is the first thing that stands out to me right then no hands you don't have to push a button to draw this like you can do whatever you want with your hands while you're hitting it so I feel like that is the most upside about the about a pod system itself is the fact that you know you don't need to use press a button to hit it you just need to pull men in the designs at that you know they'd be coming out with with the paws system it's just the fact that you have a proprietary battery so you can really match it up and make it look very very appealing so that would be the first thing that I like about the pause systems is just the convenience and the visual appeal so back onto the cartridge side man I'm getting smack Manny I need to do some water boys don't forget summer is coming up man getting hot you guys need to stay hydrated all the time right so what's going on a 3-point boo it wasn't at three point eight holy shoot damn dude I think the first hit that I did was a three point eight so let's go ahead and now hit it a three point five and tell you what else I like about cardizem whoo that is fire dude it's so freakin smooth that I forget how much smoke is actually in my longings in their eyes like choking up so whoo yeah lemoncello definitely is I feel like the next thing that I would want to speak on about the 5/10 third cartridges are itself is I don't know what it is but I feel like I get a lot more flavor from cartridges of themselves because I've had I I can't remember what company it was exactly I don't even think they're around anymore but they went from putting it in a 5-10 thread cartridge and I remember tasting it it was so freakin good and they made the switch over to a pause system because they wanted you know hop on the wave up on the Uni style that was coming out and it just did not taste the same it did not taste the same I do not know if it has anything to do with like you know the build that 510 thread cartridges have as opposed to this one I mean at the other day they feel like they're both pretty similar you know they both have wicks in there ceramic whatever blah blah blah but I always feel like whenever I'm hitting a cartridge it's just a whole different type of like hi than I'm getting a whole type of different experience and then when I hit a pod system it's just it's satisfying for a short amount of time and then I feel like it's just I just get tired of it so that's why I'd rather choose a 5-10 thread over a frickin pod system goes one thing that I think both you know both the pod system and a 5-10 thread cartridge have their you know their negatives also so I don't know if you guys know but when you get to the bottom of a cartridge I there's always a little bit of oil up and in the pods it's significantly less as opposed to 5 10 third cards you can either way you're still losing oil it gets stuck up up at the top and I feel yeah that's maybe something that both a pod system and a cartridge system you know can both fix because with the with the holes right there it's the same thing as a pod it has a small hole right there and there are times where you just get stuck in the little crevice in between the cartridge and the hole so that's kind of a downside of both of matches [Music] dude I don't know they nailed this flavor like I keep talking about this imperial extracts cartridge but it's actually so satisfying it's my first time ever trying this limoncello it's like this is gonna be my daily driver from now on for sure screech this guy's discreteness is something that a lot of people have to deal with now it is because they don't want people knowing what they're doing and I don't know I guess nowadays everybody knows because it's 2020 you know you can't really if they see it they are gonna know automatically what it is it's been all over the news you know the cartridges have been blasted literally all over the news so people know exactly what it is so there really is no keeping it discrete but if you if you somehow find a way I feel like the most one to keep discrete would probably have to be this one because you could kind of pass off if you put it on a little on the slimmer batter you can maybe pass it off as a jewel you know take the little California weed sticker on and then boom there you go it looks kind of like a jewel and there's something they actually do have paws that are actually very very clear so you know it kind of pulls you a little bit closer to the Julian type of [ __ ] so you can pass away with very very you know look at being very very discreet is what I'm saying at the end of the day it's actually really really hard to choose which one I like better you know paws versus cartridges but if I really really had to choose I think I would just have to go with a cartridge itself like I was saying because you can endlessly switch variable wattages on this one man the hits the hits on a cartridge just hit way different as opposed to a pod man my experience is you know I'm a big long time cartridge user so it speaks for itself man it speaks for itself cartridges are you know my go-to I know that's really crazy to say and people always talk [ __ ] to me about like you know I do why do you smoke so many cartridges and like I mean now now in 2020 I've actually you know slimmed it down quite a bit I've actually been smoking a lot more deaths and I'm weed but before that I was cheating on a cartridge almost I was going through cartridges literally like two to three days but that's how crazy it was so yeah I guess 5-10 thread cartridges wins for me of us over pot systems don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the good old pot system you know they do their thing they come in clutch when when they need to so with that being said guys 510 thread being the winner let me know in the comments below what do you guys think which one do you guys like a better DEA's like 510 thread or do you guys like pods and yeah let me know if you guys have ever tried imperial extracts especially this lemoncello man is super freaking fire so I'm gonna go ahead and end out the video here if you enjoy the content do me one last favor and hit that like button comment back to me and most importantly

of this because of these labels here it's actually impossible no one can knock our stuff off and also it just takes too much work it's too much work like everyone they have to order everything they have to it's not something they can just do overnight at all and they have the etching on the carps and it's just like but what kind of business model is it to say i'm going to go into the fake cart business you know there's lower overhead because you don't have to pay for product you just send fake cards so well yeah i mean there's definitely money in it well i've been hearing already about fake cards for a few of the different brands and uh it's going to contain something well it does right so but i think okay so first things first what exactly is a fake card or a bootleg card so basically that is a cartridge that is not actually made by the the manufacturer right so it rather than it being like hey our carts cost this price because we've got all these employees staff marketing all the work that we put in for years this is what it is someone comes in and goes well damn i can order this packaging from china and i can do this other stuff here and i can just basically piggyback on these guys without putting in half to work and i can give a subpar product and uh i know i know the difference and so i can collect all the money now how do you spot a fake well first things first is always look to the test results uh test results is always first a telltale sign uh are the test results uh when you scan the qr code does it have the company name does it or does it have a different company's name does it have uh how many tests does that have as well if you see something like a 99 it's just [ __ ] i mean it's just they don't i it might not be fake but it's it's [ __ ] uh wait let's stop here we've already done a video on this i don't want to get into it again uh but basically there's no real 99 cards out there because you would have to you always put in terps stardudas it's not possible but anyway um so typically you you the colors are off the colors are off um the oil is off i mean you can look at a cartridge and they'll have a similar looking cartridge but what will happen is is that uh you know you'll see the oil inside and the bubble will move and if the bubble's moving it's typically being cut right again save cost say put a little bit of mct oil in there that used to be the thing in the day that people would when i get when we started with carts i mean pg and vg vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol were standard they were standard and i mean now even on the nicotine side i know that people uh still regularly use propane glycol with nicotine or vegetable glycerin or peg400 and uh i just want everyone to know that we actually had a customer that asked us like hey what exactly is this in the cartridge right they didn't it's so distal distal is in the cartridge and terpenes that's it we've never any fillers there's no no other crap in there another thing you'll see with the fake hearts too was i remember the whole scandal with all the vapes and everyone's getting sick because everyone was cutting their stuff with vitamin e acetate and vitamin e was basically looked the same your oil would be hard so the bubble didn't move and then people were just vaping junk and that's the other thing that's scary is like if you buy a product that you don't know uh where it came from or for instance somebody calls up a store they say hey i'm with owls they're going to send you some for free you want to place an order and then they end up getting subpar products there's no regulation around it right because it's fake and so you don't know what you're getting in there and especially it's not like you're buying a fake bag right you're buying something that you're going to ingest and put in your body so the last thing you want to do is to buy a product that is is not from a reputable distributor or wholesaler so i think the advice would really be to only buy from like us either direct from the store or make sure that your brands either have some way to tell you how to differentiate yours from others that's why it is to make sure you buy your product from your store yes i know it's also to wait lives it's also to where to live people who i know yes and no i mean that's not really the main thing the main thing is they want all the money i i i think it would actually be better if er taking away from the vape that you could actually just order cards directly from the the provider and know that they're legit i mean i don't really know how you tell if you go into a store and someone has like a product unless they said and i'm not trying to to their own horn here but unless it's owls you know exactly what it is there's literally no one else that even has any sort of tracking information on their products there's no way to differentiate any of them so i don't really know what other people do i mean yeah i don't i don't really know but uh there's definitely a bunch of fakes going out there and it's just important to always stay safe and that's why i like i like the amount of work that we put into our products this is the reason i'm here if you look we remember when i was working with the testing lab that's why i met you you kept doing all this testing i said this dude's legit he's legit he does more testing than anybody i know on his products well thank you thank you steve i'm impressed and that's and naturally and i think you look at the ingredients right because it comes from the start to finish right it's like like if you have good ingredients it means you have a good product made you care but that doesn't really correlate back to fake products at all so it was i went a little off there but overall i think look the most important thing here is this is that there is a bunch of fake products out there i'll tell you this delta nine on the delta nine side there's just like oh my goodness like if you have any of your friends and i know the people you at home you have you know people trying to sell a cookie's car all that stuff is absolutely a joke any black market stuff any carts black market i mean no testing it's junk i would not believe a thing i would not touch a black market card i mean if you could get a delta eight card why would you ever buy a black market brand again really i like i i i don't really know why you would take the risk when you could just buy it uh a delta a cars in general but um that's really all i gotta say on on our carts on on fake carts in general uh just be careful out there there's so many shysters and uh make sure that you either reach out to your provider and ask them always ask for owls or yeah just save yourself a hassle just ask for owls instead and just know you're no you're good and look for the testing look for the testing scan the qr code be safe everyone adios and what is a fake card i think it's good it's not fake it's not fake it's a guitar branding oh it's no brand it's a bootleg it's a bootleg and then i suppose fake", "zY7dMIYPhcI": "hey guys what's up it's cyn here back to you guys today with another video and in today's video we're going to be reviewing the uh colorado hemp pineapple express delta 8 disposable cart um we tried a hit of this in the uh stimulus check haul video but we didn't give it like a full-fledged review um so now i've smoked it a little bit i haven't been smoking it a ton though because i wanted to kind of give you guys as much of like my first half of the cart impressions so go ahead and grab whatever you guys are smoking on and cheers get a nice blinker hit on that so starting with starting with the flavor on these it is fantastic the pineapple notes aren't too [ __ ] heavy but they're there um and um the delta eight in this is very very decent uh the quality of the oil is very nice um just from the few hits that i've taken from it um not like right this second but like over when i did hit it a couple times i did feel it very much so and that's why we're going to go ahead and hit it again so cheers big shout out to lucky smoke shot for sponsoring this video um this pen ran me 25 um not very bad not very bad at all and it's pretty quality it's 95 percent delta eight oil and five percent terpenes as well as if you get delta eight liquid it is refillable now i don't know in terms of how refillable like how many times you'd be able to get a usage out of it but you can take the top off to it and put oil in there and it doesn't come with the charger but it takes a standard micro usb charger for your typical android not a usbc it is a standard charger um go ahead and hit whatever you guys are smoking on and cheers again huge shout out to lucky smoke shop for uh sponsoring this video quality product very much enjoyed it so far um and taste is good price point is good most of the delta eight carts are running around like 35 to 40 for a gram cart and this one runs you 25 the only minor inconvenience that i've experienced is the oil is really really thick and the bubbles are really hard to get out and uh but other than that i mean thick oil just means it's quality oil so we never have a problem with that you know um and yeah that's that's pretty much the review so thank you guys for watching this video um if you guys haven't already make sure to hit like and subscribe and hit that notification bell so you don't miss any more videos like this one and uh until next time [Music] stay blaze you", "-QsSBiww3VM": "Hey everyone and welcome back to the Sawickipedia. Today we're back in the Cube as we're going to install some steering wheel controls.\nThis model of the Cube doesn't actually have steering wheel controls, so I've ordered these little guys off eBay which basically just have\na little double-sided sticky piece that sticks on to the steering wheel, so we're\ngonna try that out. This is the little controller box, so these are little\nwireless controls which have a cr2032 battery in each of them.\nThey claim that it will last up to two years of use but we'll see about that,\nwon't know for a while I don't think. So the first thing we need to do is pull\nthe stereo out once again, which is fairly simple.\nI've done it a few times now, so we'll do that and after that we hook up the\nlittle control box. So it does have I think five different cables so you've\ngot power, ground, there's four cables, power, ground and control one and control\ntwo or key one key two, which I've just quickly wired up to a 3.5mm audio jack\nso hopefully that'll work out. I haven't actually soldered anything\nyet because I'm not sure which way around the cables are gonna go, but we'll\npull the odd stereo out find out from there. If you haven't seen how to get\nthis out, you can definitely check out the install videos from when we\ninstalled the stereo. If you don't want to do that, it's really\nsimple just pull the ashtray out, there's two screws at the bottom that need to\ncome out, and then this you just pull straight off, and there's just a little\nclip for the hazard lights up here which just needs to be pushed in.\nOf course I can never actually manage to do it properly. I'll just grab a tool for that. A flat-head screwdriver will do it. And the cigarette lighter,\njust need to take out the four screws that hold the stereo in, try not to drop anything. Alright once those four screws are out the stereo will just come straight out.\nI'm not sure if I can angle it around enough, but towards the back, but next to the microphone\ninput is the input for the steering wheel controls. Obviously double-check\nwith your stereo manufacturer if your unit is actually capable of handling\nsteering wheel controls, so I'll just plug that in. Now this little control box\nobviously needs power as well, so I'll have to wire up the red cable to the\nauxiliary power and obviously black to ground, guess I'll have to pull that out, I'll just use the\nexisting wires on the stereo to do that. We've hooked up the ground and accessories\nwire, so hopefully our little control box should have power we'll just turn the\naccessories on. Turn that shit off. Ok, so the Pioneer system gives the option\nfor a steering wheel control without adapter. I'm just gonna go for Japanese car\nand with any luck we should be able to program these little guys to the corresponding buttons. So volume down, hold that for a second. Mute, left, right, that's pretty much it for that one. And on the other side, so it's got a\nGPS button, I'll probably just program that to the microphone so if we need to\ntalk to Google assistant or Siri, hitting that GPS button we'll bring that up,\nseems like the most logical choice. Obviously they're little phone buttons\nso off hook, on hook, stop, I guess we'll program that to.. I dunno, it doesn't really matter, let's just\nprogram that to phone. And in the middle is a little M button so I'm gonna\nactually program that to AVsource so when you hit that it will cycle through\nradio or Bluetooth audio or whatever. So that looks like it, let's give it a test.\nSo yeah hitting that M button will go to radio and then as I said Spotify,\nwhatever's programmed on the head unit. Pushing the stop button will open up the phone book,\nbecause that's just basically turning the phone function on.\nOff hook and on hook don't seem to do anything because we're not in a call.\nYou'll probably notice there was a random pause there because hitting the Google\nassistant button automatically brings up Google assistant on my phone, so that was\nprobably a bad idea but that'll explain that. The rest of the buttons, obviously\nvolume up and down, left and right will just switch through radio stations at\nthe moment otherwise it'll skip tracks if you're in Bluetooth audio or playing\na CD whatever you doing and mute mutes. So that's really about it, obviously it's\na really simple one today and these little guys were like 15 bucks off eBay.\nSo it's a piece of piss putting them in. You can't really go wrong as long as\nyour head unit is compatible with steering wheel controls that don't\nrequire an adapter. And the cube steering wheel is almost ideal because\nit's got these nice little flat spots, so they'll sit perfectly on them.\nThere are other ones that I saw on eBay that sort of wrap around the steering wheel, so the\ncontrols are just on the inside, but I imagine that it get quite annoying\nbecause you'd be running into them all the time. So yeah I'd grab a pair of\nthese if your head unit can handle it. It's definitely a goer.\nAs always thanks again for watching, I hope this has helped you out, be sure to\nhit the like button if it has, and you can subscribe, and we'll see you for more\ncrazy Sawickipedia adventures.

next video sorry it's this video I don't know bro I don't know the", "aDv6EP4uQMg": "hey it's matt at roughhouse studios and welcome to my product spotlight for the aeris mystica pro cartridge vaporizer this video is sponsored by aris if you'd like to learn more about the mystica pro or their other products please visit aristechshop.com [Music] now let's take a look at what comes in the box with the aeris mystica pro it's a nice little small package there it comes with the arrest vaporizer there's also a little packet that contains a usb charging ribbon and a couple of brass adapters and we'll take a look at what all those items do later and of course there's also an instruction manual now let's zoom in and take a closer look at the aris mystica pro this is a nice metal frame it's got a slider on the side and that's to adjust the height to push the cartridge out when it's attached of course we'll take a look at that later there's also on the top a slider to slide a lid to close over the top of the cartridge and conceal it then on the bottom side we have the micro usb charging port that's the old style micro and then on the one side with the button we have the logo and then there's the one function button that does all the functions that it has and it has quite a few actually and then there's also the little tiny little light there that's an indicator light and then also included in the package is the two little brass adapters and those are to attach to different size or different height of cartridges this will fit in most fine thread cartridges with those various adapters [Music] now let's charge it up and see how the functions and features work when you plug it in and charge it it has a little red light that indicates it's on it goes off when it's charged when you put the cartridge in there it'll flash three times to let you know that the made a connection and then you press the button three times to cycle through the three different heat settings there's also a preheat mode that you access by handing the button two times and in this mode the device will preheat the cartridge at a low temperature so as not to burn it up but to heat the oil so that it comes down to the bottom of the cartridge and once it's preheated if you decide to use that function and it's ready to hit you hit the device just by pressing the button and inhaling it through it you cut it on and off with five clicks of the button like you do almost every vaporizer another really cool feature that it has is the ability to be able to cover for the cartridge so you can use the slider to pull the cartridge down into there and then the top to cover over the top of it another feature that this one has is something that i really haven't seen on a vaporizer yet it's really cool it's the uv cleaning mode now this mode is activated when the device is on but the cartridge is extracted down into the device and then you hold the button for three seconds and enters into the cleaning mode and it shines a uv light onto the cartridge on the inside there to clean it so that's a really innovative feature that has come at a really good time in our culture so there is the features and functions of the mystica pro [Music] and now finally we're going to get into the usage with a cartridge i've made uh some e-juice with some rosin and terpenes and filled the cartridge and i've tested it on all three levels and on the low medium and high it's kind of functions in that with the the higher the setting the bigger the puffs but it gets a little harsh when you get you know to the higher end but if you like the bigger puffs you're definitely going to get them out of this really good performance [Music] now let's jump into the highlights it fits most standard cartridges with those two adapters that are included it has the ample 650 milliamp battery three heat settings including also a preheat mode that really innovative uv cleaning mode which is really interesting to me first i've seen that a slider to adjust the height for the cartridges you got the lid to cover over and protect the cartridges and under 50 i think it's a good deal one thing that you want to be cautioned about is that you can check your connection when you hit the cartridge in there it should flash three times if not you maybe want to check and make sure you have the brass ring put on properly if you'd like to learn more about or to purchase the heiress mystica pro please visit aristechshop.com [Music] i hope you enjoyed this product spotlight if you did hit the like

wrong with it so if y'all could just help me out that'd be great thank you leave comments try too early link to a video whatever but uh help would be appreciated by", "xdekygz4k-I": "alright guys so I just recently bought my first ecig so love at rube and it was all gone pretty well and I got these standed clearomizers everything I was going on right but after a while I got a sort of a really really burnt dry hit taste I looked up on the internet try to find something - I don't know remedy or fix this problem I couldn't really find anything there was some some guy who had a similar problem but no real fix was found they said just tip it sideways and take a couple drags but I tried that and the dry hit comes back so I took took another one of these clearomizers that I have unused and I took a look at it and take a closer look you can see you can see that rubber cap on the inside there this one and if you look where the wick goes see how it's sort of sort of sticks out here yeah and it's pushing down on the wicks a fair bit in there you can see the wick comes up and enters here so I've fixed I've fixed my problem but what I did is I'll show you guys how to do this so what you got to do is you got to pull it apart so just unscrew this put it aside and if you take a wire and make a little like a hook on the end sort of I just push it inside down past past the rubber and the outside like like that and now push it down all the way and sort of twist it a little to the side and just pull that might take a couple goes until you get it right all right so once you pull it out far enough you'll see you see this this thing here sticks out a little just enough for you to get a pair of pliers and grip it once you grip it just pull it out all right so what you'll need to do is after you get this little rubber Cup out just push this metal piece out for now get a bit of a squeeze put that aside now what we're going to want to do is here's one clearomizer that's filled up already just to show you I haven't modified this one yet what we're going to do is is just cut off just like about that much just a little bit just so that the end of the rubber Cup comes up to just just about the top of the wick so it's not real so it doesn't restrict the wick soaking up soaking up the e-liquid all right so you got to get your get your exacto knife a bit of a push and take off just just a little bit if you're unsure how much to take off just let it take off a little bit rather than too much if you take off too much it can cause it to leak all right all right so after you've taken off a little bit it should look something like this and doesn't have to be perfect so long as you don't take off too much if you take off too much like I said it will leak I so now just take your metal thing he took out before and just push it back inside the rubber Cup like [ __ ] off you've done that that's pretty much it you just grab your have your clearomizer and put this rubber cup back inside and give it a bit of a push grab your wire again and just push around the edges of the rubber Cup like around here just pop it back in and and back on and if you can see if you have the rubber cup comes up the to the top of the wick see and there's no flaring on the rubber cup because it's not pushing down on the wick unlike this one you compare the two see how much longer this this one is compared to this one over here and see the flaring whereas this one has no flame this one now will work a lot better and it'll eliminate your dry hits but yeah he's not that great but I got two of them for free with my lava tube and one of them was dead on arrival and the guy replaced it and gave me another one for free so I've got three now I've also got this some VV Nova which is pretty good haven't got any dry hits out of that yet pretty happy with it fully rebuildable but I'm just waiting for my my standard ones the C for as long as I got with it to wear out and then I'm just going to use the VV Nova but yeah so if your came with these and you're wondering why you're getting a dry hit or a burnt taste it's most likely that the wick is too dry and and yeah you'll get you get dry hits every now and then I mean if you leave it long enough it sucks up the liquid but yeah anyways that's about it and that's that's ready to fill up now and you ready for some vaping all right a nice thanks guys for watching see you later", "TfeV8ovey8w": "guys it's a big girl stella is also recording a video but i want to just show you my vape collection and some tricks i know how to do and i scored like an absolute square it's shattered but it still works if you can see the lc screen it's charging but um this is a smok x priv and i got it for free so because it was broken um it actually had the bubble glass on it and i couldn't see the screen through the bubble glass because it was like all broken and melted up so i just took it off i will i'm hoping to re-melt it and bring it back down but well still it does still both of my vapes so but i can show you what i have in the box i have a posh plus i think this one is a raspberry ice this one is just pretty sure it's just tobacco flavored it's like breeze i'm up for gusty and then i have a blueberry mint brace plus and then i have all of these these air bars air by lux i have one two these two are green apple i have a i think we think these ones are great but we don't know then we have another earbud this one's my favorite i said that yesterday the last video another air bar we found some more today this one is my favorite out of all of my disposables instead i can i can do a video if you guys want me to do a video on how you can recharge these disposables just say it and i can do it because i know how to so all of these i can recharge and reuse and everything so this one is a i think it's a blue lemonade yeah this is just vanilla one of my all-time favorites then this i was hoping to take the battery out of it is a posh plus one sec yeah it's posh plus xl this is really big um compared it to a quarter of one sec the posh plus xl bottom compared to the quarter it's about that big one really big um i was going to do a review on my reusable vape and my box mod but stella distilled them and took them for her own video yeah i'm going to do a review because i'm the one that has them and i use them the most so i will do a separate review on that one and i'm hoping to do another review on a box mod that i will be getting from my friend but i'm sure she won't mind if i do a review on it um also this is not sponsored but i get a lot of my vapes from a website called vape sourcing it is so good they have really cheap vapes there um the one of mine i got only for seven bucks which is so cheap and it's so good i will do a review on that one that i got for it but i also want to do a video of i'm also gonna do in this video of me organizing this because i got one two three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and then 14 disposable once hers dies and it's close so but i was thinking about just color coordinating and brand coordinating so all the blues would go together so this one probably just go on the top this one we never use i actually really dislike heights they're just crap material they break so easily and they die really quickly i just don't like them see it's accidentally broken i would actually like to know what's inside of them though so it doesn't look that great so the blues are all going to go together on the bottom layer i had some in it you just couldn't tell this i'm going to put on the top we're going to do the yellows yellows and golds together i'm just going to put this one little red right there and these are mostly just miscellaneous colors terrible okay change of location better lighting though i have my expert baby smok someone was calling me that's i don't know that's why but this is charging right now and i want to get it a new mod thing up here this is actually not supposed to go to this it's supposed to be with a drip tip and everything it has a drip tip but it's not a a tank which is what i want to get for it but right now it's a right now it's dead but it up and down buttons i haven't used this yet so i can't tell you how good it is because i just got this up and down buttons up voltage down voltage power button and that's about all i can tell you for this i just but it does have really big good clouds that's a lot of it i can tell you about that one but this one my exceed edge this is the one i got off vape sourcing so five clicks on five clicks off two clicks to preheat this light tells you if it's dying it can tell you um when it starts blinking fast it means it's dying so oh that was i was not expecting to cough about that but this doesn't it has such long battery life it charges fast but if you want it to like last the whole time like i'm not even kidding it can last up to two months without charging this but if you use it all the time it's probably gonna only be around a month but if you want it to stay charged probably about two hours for charging and i think this holds about three milliliters of liquid goes all the way up there and when it comes it comes with an extra coil if you want me to do like a full ghost review video on this i can and i can teach you how to change the coil and everything you can show you the box but if you it comes with a separate coil a plug one of these just in case you lose this plug and it has a little targeting cord too that's about although so it comes with two coils here's the fire button press it down this works great i love this this is my everyday use i can do more than clouds by that but um i really like this one i can also teach you how to make these are just all future videos future video ideas but i can also teach you how to make your own vape juice and it's a lot easier than what people think it is it just doesn't taste as good so if you're really going for the flavor you should probably go for one of the pre-bought ones but you do whatever you want to do and if i show you the exact puff without doing any tricks it can make bigger ones than that you know as it heats up but i've had this for a pretty long time it has a nice sleek design this is it compared to my hand it's a pretty normal size probably about like as long as a jewel but like thicker and here's the tip that's what got my attention and this is what made me buy it so i would definitely recommend this and i only got this for seven bucks so yeah i really like this one that's the end of my video now i can definitely do more reviews if you guys want to recommend a vape to me i totally can do it i will buy it and i will do a review on it but just comment down below if you want me to do other ones bye", "wW9JY_l8BnY": "this is your hunky vape 5 on friday vaping new science and advocacy report for the 19th of march 2021 today we have new regulations in massachusetts american cancer society is being a hypocrite in kentucky marijuana dispensaries in missouri start selling vapes we have increased tax news in malaysia new zealand government remember last week we were talking about the new zealand government and how they just released the report that their uh tobacco tax revenue is half of what it was the year before well now they've got a new proposed vaping amendment bill that includes partial flavor ban yeah and it's already got an unexpected consequence i mean the bill was just introduced and now there's already a consequence of it yeah i also have an awesome bloomberg article published in the brussels times and i've come to realize that vaping has an image problem in the european union but that doesn't stop an independent retail store magazine informing its members that vaping is the most popular aid to quit smoking because it works we also have a eureka alert scientific paper examining gene expression when exposed to electronic cigarette aerosol well more like the lack thereof and i got a spiked article telling governments and media to stop spreading needless fear about vaping because it's costing people their lives you know why because vaping is a life-saving technology ain't nothing to it but to get into it yes ladies and gentlemen and here's the news this week i took last week off for my 50th birthday and jumped back into it today going all right what do we got what do we got today well it's got some good news got some bad news got some news that makes you go what i have a sub of mine that um is contacting me on facebook a couple different times asking different questions and whatnot and he left a comment on my 200 sub thank you video vape vlog saying that you know he fell off the wagon and uh smoked a cigarette and i'm like okay i mean i understand you fall off the wagon you know times are tough cigarettes are readily available on every street corner every convenience store every gas station most of the supermarkets some of the pharmacies i mean vaping that's a pain in the ass to try and get a hold of in some places in this country and now with the impending vape mail ban it's just going to get worse so i'm looking around i'm going all right well let me let me focus on the northeast segment of the country because that's where he lives and i'm like is there some new legislation there or something i don't know about well couldn't find anything in the state that he lives in but still some bad news massachusetts fall mouth board of health voted monday to revise two local tobacco regulations regarding exposure and sales yeah if massachusetts isn't hard enough on the vaping industry well fall mouth now decides that they need to impose some additional restrictions yeah how about new obviously it's all because of the kitties we gotta look out for the little kids because they're helpless and if we don't impose all these laws that [ __ ] over every american adult whoops and you know these kids are gonna do whatever they want not thinking about the fact that the kids are gonna do whatever they want anyway so whoops your laws do not make the situation better they only make it worse thank you i really appreciate your efforts well smoking and vaping is prohibited in any location that is now open to the public how about news yeah so no public transportation no playgrounds indoor and outdoor events and outdoor areas where food and beverages are served such as restaurants bars taverns yeah smoking bars such as cigar and hookah bars yeah well they're also prohibited now so if you owned one of those in town lock the door because you're out of business have a nice day yeah great and this is you know in order to prevent uh youth tobacco use yeah well businesses cannot sell or distribute any flavored tobacco product the taster smells like fruit chocolate candy mint or dessert or anything else you know might attract adults to the store i mean the teams it might attract the teens to the store seriously these teens are not buying them in the store whoops you really that ignorant you really think this is gonna stop them you haven't gotten onto any social media platform recently have you nope because it's everywhere whoops and you don't if you ban it in your town you think that they're not going to drive to the next town and buy it nope or the next state nope or the next country if they have to we talked about that last week in the news too yeah whoops they drive to canada whoops buy it bring it home get on social media they got a holiday paid for by all the stuff they brought home and sold yeah but you know that's not going to stop you from issuing these new laws nope yeah because you think that the stores in town are selling it to the kids yeah well if you're a business in that town and you were selling it to kids shame on you and let me tell you there's going to be major fines now businesses found in violation of the regulations are gonna face hefty fines the first offense that you get turned in for is gonna cost you a thousand dollars yeah so if you have a business in this town and you were selling vape stuff to kids yeah it's a thousand dollar fine and a second violation whoops carries a two thousand dollar fine as well as a suspension of the businesses tobacco product sales permit whoops yeah for seven days whoops yeah and then if they catch you again now it's gonna be a five thousand dollar fine issued yeah and a suspension of your business license for 30 days ah yeah that's in full mouth massachusetts beautiful just keep slamming the laws and keep slamming the regulations because you think it's going to change what people do nope well there's no talking to these uh zealots cause they don't want to hear it they don't care well how about the american cancer society decides they don't like something that happened in kentucky oh and this might also be some news for you if you didn't know it well the kentucky legislature just decided that well since vaping helps people quit smoking maybe we shouldn't tax the [ __ ] out of it and make it more expensive and cigarette so what do they do well they just remove the 15 wholesale tax on hardware used in electronic smoking devices as long as it's not being sold with the e-liquid so therefore it's you know an incomplete thing so the kentucky residents can now save some money just order a bunch of hardware don't include any e-liquid in your cart because then the tax still applies so if you just want to buy a bunch of hardware well there's no tax there's no 15 wholesale tax added now yeah pretty good news well except for the american cancer society being a hypocrite you know because vaping has nothing to do with cancer oh well except when people take up vaping they reduce their cancer risk yeah 97 percent yeah but the american cancer society doesn't care about that 97 no they want their revenue they want their customer stream their customer base because if it you know all these people quit smoking well then there's gonna be a lot less people having cancer and well that's gonna cut their funding so we we better stop that let's go against the vaping and make sure that we have plenty of a customer base well it sounds pretty bad doesn't it am i an [ __ ] for saying that nope i mean well that's the only thing i can come up with on why they would push for this vaping tax to be vetoed this vaping tax repeal on tobacco harm reduction to be repealed that's the only i could come up with i don't know well regardless of what you think that's what my opinion is and i'm sorry but i took a week off and i come back and i'm not happy with what i'm seeing here this is nuts well hey what's going on there you probably heard about the nicotine in the thc and the black market cartridges that caused the avalia outbreak that had nothing to do with nicotine vaping because there is no vitamin e acetate in nicotine vaping products and there never was yeah well this story comes from kansas city missouri there medical marijuana dispensaries are not going to start selling vape products so if you live in missouri well now you can go into your local dispensary in addition to your vape shop to get your cartridges your nicotine yeah are they only going to be marijuana vape cartridges not according to what this guy said wasn't a law change that allowed this it was a decision that they did and they pushed for it and got approval so if you live in kansas city missouri or in the state of missouri and you don't have a local vape shop but you do have a marijuana dispensary nearby well then i'd stop in and see them they might have some vape stuff you can get to keep you off of deadly combustible cigarettes yeah well malaysia they're frothing at the mouth yeah the government is frothing at the mouth because they're looking at this going we need to change their tax laws we need more tax money we need more revenue to be able to run this government and i see a market opportunity here yeah because in malaysia the vaping industry has been around for a long time and they've got like a million vapors in malaysia yeah over 1 million consumers using various vaping products well that's a tax base so they're going to be looking at new taxation frameworks how about new well because they want your tax money the current malaysian vape industry is valued at 2.27 malaysian ringgits and if you're looking for a conversion into that well it's worth about one malaysian ringgit is worth about 25 cents in the united states so you'll have to take that 2.27 billion and divide it by four to come up with the actual dollar value of it well they're looking to gain 300 million malaysian ringgits in taxes and excise tax revenue once they get this law ironed out and figure out the exact rate they're gonna have to impose well to get that new source of revenue how about new yeah you can take a look at the link in the description below if you want to read more about the malaysian tax nope well we talked about last week new zealand published their tax revenue and well it was half of what it was the year before so we talked about how they were going to be looking at you know some possible new legislation because well that's a revenue shortfall we have to make that up somehow and there were people that were begging the government not to raise the taxes just let them slide down because it means that vaping is successfully converting people away from combustible tobacco whoops oh so that it's working so let's just let it keep working we don't want people to smoke tobacco we don't want people lighting up right well it's not what's going on there is proposed legislation and it's going to include a partial flavor ban it's the smoke free environments and regulated products vaping amendment bill and they were looking for suggestions and submissions and comments well that was until the day after my birthday you know and and now they're going to be ironing out what these regulations are and from the looks of it well they might have a partial flavor ban well what happens when you threaten to take people's flavors away from them well if you're like me you just go buy a bunch of flavors and then you make your own but not everybody knows how to do that so what do they do well when the vape shops close at night you just smash the window in you bust through the front door and you get yourself a nice lifetime supply of vape stuff [Music] [Applause] what what seriously yeah that's exactly what happened yeah the matamata vape crew store was robbed this week as thieves stole thousands of dollars of vaping products and caused considerable amount of damage they cruised one of new zealand's leading vape shops with eight stores nationally selling top quality devices and premier kiwi made e-liquids well they these people went in and they robbed a place in the middle of the night and well if they're vapers they've got a lifetime supply of vape gear if they're not well then the criminals well they got a lot of inventory to sell in the black market whoops they might not be on the black market yet but if they impose this legislation and come august all the flavors are gone well that's going to be worth a lot of money yeah let's say you that they broke in and they stole 5 000 worth of e-liquid right well if you just hang on to that until oh i don't know september october november after these regulations go into effect if they actually do impose these flavor bans well that flavored e-liquid is gonna be worth like 20 000. yeah you'll be able to sell for four times what you could sell it for cause people are going to go into the shop and they're gonna go i don't want tobacco-flavored e-liquid nope what that's all you sell now well we're not allowed to have candy or fruit or bakeries or any of that stuff all you're allowed to buy now is tobacco nope what this is a tobacco harm reduction product because it gets people away from combustible tobacco why would you want the flavor of combustible tobacco never dull moment never a dull moment well we have an article that was published in the brussels times that i found and because the brussels times is like a lot of these media outlets nowadays plastering so many advertisements across their websites and newspapers that you literally have to jump through 20 hoops to read the article well i just went to the author's actual website they actually paid they actually paid for the article they actually paid somebody to write an article for them imagine that well here is this is this article was published in the brussels times and this is actually from the author's website because you know when you're an author and you write a bunch of stuff well then you know when you go to a apply for a job somewhere or you or you are trying to freelance and trying to write articles from different places and the newspaper editor is like well i don't know who you are i don't know what you've done well you can refer them back to your website where you have a list of all the articles that you've already written in all the publications that it was you know accepted and printed and disseminated for the world to consume so here we have yale asovsky forgive me if i pronounced your name wrong but he published an article in brussels times titled bloomberg's misguided push to outlaw vaping in developing nations yeah but we've heard a lot of bloomberg lately in the news and he's got so much money he could spend it every single day of his life and never run out and that's exactly what he's doing matter of fact he's got businesses set up to spend his money because he's got so much of it well they're not called businesses they're called philanthropic ngos non-governmental organizations because he wants to make the world a better place as long as you do it the way he wants to do it how about new he'll give you some money and you can go out and foster his agenda [Music] yeah well wonderful article pointing out all of little bloomberg's maneuvers about how bloomberg's charity partnered with the brussels capital region government for an initiative on air pollution and sustainability whoops yeah he boosted his role in the world gov world health organizations yeah became a global ambassador for non-communicable diseases and injuries oh it's not just tobacco that you know he's the ambassador for because you know when you give them money well they'll give you all kinds of titles whatever you want never thought i'd see the day when michael bloomberg would be like well he's kind of like a prostitute yeah well he's not the prostitute all the pup all the people he gives money to are prostitutes because they'll do whatever they want as long as he keeps shoving money into their pockets whoops yeah well vaping is better than smoking michael bloomberg's money is being caught in countries all around the globe it isn't just our world country in developing nations where his money has infiltrated the government take a look at this article the beautiful read points out a couple of different places i mean we talked about the philippines how about in mexico just past week it was revealed that a staff lawyer for the campaign for tobacco-free kids you know one of the largest global tobacco control groups well he's funded by bloomberg philanthropies yeah well they just drafted the law to severely restrict imports in the sales of vaping devices yeah it's alleged that carmen mendel president of the health committee of the mexican chamber of deputies well he contracted with the charity to advise on the law yeah but he ended up submitting a draft bill to still contain the name of the ngo lawyer who wrote the law whoops oops i guess he was supposed to take that out of the paper before he handed it in this is compounded by ongoing investigations into foreign ngo influence on similar policies in india where prime minister narendra modi severed ties with the bloomberg charity after his domestic intelligence services raised concerns hey man where'd you get all that money from shh it was bloomberg bloomberg gave it to me all i had to do was change a couple words in the legislation i was proposing no big deal in nations where vaping is endorsed and recommended by health authorities such as the united kingdom and new zealand real reductions in the number of smokers can be seen and i guess bloomberg doesn't want that because he's fighting against it unfortunately michael bloomberg's charity keeps giving and giving and giving and has been significant and well intended however the groups that receive the money for tobacco control have made the deadly mistake of equating cigarettes to the real alternative of vaping devices my weight dashboard this will be detrimental to the global health on a massive scale because he is undertaking his little trojan horse operations in every country that will let him get away with it how about new there'll be a link in the description below if you want to read the actual article and i'll also put the one in for brussels times in case you like looking at a bunch of advertisements while you're trying to read articles okay how about new let's move on turns out that uh vaping image there's an image problem about vaping in the european union i mean we looked at the euro barometer survey before right matter of fact if you go back on some of my videos you'll see i even you know contributed to it well sort of i showed people how to you know go about and fill it out all depends on where you live because that was part of the information they're trying to gather so i had relatives of mine go and fill this out because they live in europe and well even though they that they don't vape i wanted them to give an impression of what they see and what they think because it matters what people think you don't have to be a vaper to put your input in because it matters and it also reveals the fact that well the general public oh in the last couple years their impression of vaping has gone way downhill their impression of vaping is tanked oh jesus oh that's unbelievable no no no it just goes to show you how effective all of bloomberg's money has been and if you really really dig into the data you could probably calculate how many people die every single day because of bloomberg's philanthropic philanthropic endeavors wow i wonder who's got the balls to actually come up with and calculate that yeah publish that on the new york times front page bloomberg philanthropies cost the globe x number of lives yeah it could easily be done [Music] well it takes his money i wonder if bloomberg would fund that himself i don't think so well the euro barometer survey shows that among those who have little or no experience in vaping only 20 think that electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products help smokers quit 20 well that means 80 of the people need to be educated about the truth oh there's a lot of work to be done here vaping is better than smoking 70 think they do not the proportion of all respondents who believe the electronic cigarettes are harmful to the health of their users increased from 27 in 2012 to 65 last year and the survey doesn't ask what they mean by harmful because you know nobody has ever claimed the electronic cigarettes are completely risk-free but there are indications elsewhere that the average member of the public thinks that the risks are much greater than they are yeah we talked about that before too there's a percentage of the public out there that thinks that vaping is worse for you than smoking and they constantly belittle people to tell them man you should be smoking put that vape and throw it in the garbage i'll buy you a pack of cigarettes well that's the dumbest thing i ever heard in my entire life well they don't think it's the dumbest thing in the world because looking at all the media coverage that's been put out there well vaping is better than smoking it's not good whoops it's a sad day when the truth is constantly being belittled away the scientific studies are out there and they prove the vaping is safer it's a more effective way to quit smoking than pharmaceutical products and traditional nicotine replacement therapy products but that information is being suppressed and discredited if they can't discredit the science well then they just discredit the person that's publishing the information they personally attack that person to clean the slate and you know it's back like the old days when you had the mafia yeah you disrespected the mafia well they just take you off of the playing field they don't mess around even in england where health agencies have largely embraced vaping the number of smokers who think vaping is as dangerous or more dangerous and smoking rose directly from 36 percent to 53 last year less than a third of the people correctly believe the vaping is less harmful than smoking anti-vaping propaganda is brain poison and 40 percent of them wrongly believe that nicotine causes cancer nicotine does not cause cancer matter of fact nicotine vaping has a 97 percent less harm than smoking 97 less and depending on the flavoring you use it could be 99 percent less let's keep on vaping like our lives depend on it because they kind of do vaping has the potential to make the combustible cigarette obsolete within a generation and yet a decade after the electronic cigarettes came out of the marketplace the european union has 12 times as many smokers as it does vapors something has gone very wrong something has gone badly wrong [Music] truth is being squashed [Music] well focusing on the uk because that's where it has been embraced as tobacco harm reduction public health england has released its seventh independent report on vaping in england outlining the attitudes towards vaping and smoking in the country and when looking at vaping prevalence among adults the proportion of vapors who also smoke has declined since 2012. the figures vary which according to the public health england is the result of different definitions of smoking status data from the smoking toolkit study shows a drop from 92 percent to 51 percent tobacco harm reduction works when it's allowed to flourish vaping helps people quit smoking all you gotta do is let people vape make vaping cheaper than it is to smoke deadly combustible tobacco no that's not what's happening well this betterretailing.com is aimed at independent convenience store owners and it lets them know that well if you are an independent convenience store owner you should pick up vaping products and sell them in your convenience store because well it helps people quit smoking it improves their health how do we know that improves our health well there's scientific studies documenting it and here's another one that was just published yeah vape aerosol and gene expression in human lung tissue compared to cigarette smoking just published march 19th that's today and what does this study that was published do well they're not only looking to see whether there's damage or neuron they're actually studying the genealogical effects of vaping to see if it alters your dna you know what they found using highly sensitive toxicity testing you know what they found out nope cells that are exposed to aerosol from vaping are comparable to cells that are exposed to air the air we breathe around it they also expose those cells to cigarette smoke and documented the damage done to lung cells exposed to cigarette smoke yeah if you're actually interested in the methodology if you're actually interested in what the actual detailed findings are there'll be a link in the description below i highly recommend you read it let's keep on vaping like our lives depend on it because they kind of do [Music] what's the uh findings of this study we encourage regulators and policymakers to consider the weight of evidence that shows the clear scientific differences between combustible cigarettes which burn tobacco and potentially harm reducing next generation products that do not next generation products are vapes vaping is better than smoking when you compare vapes to combustible cigarette smoke there's clear evidence that they are not the same thing whoops misinformation misinformation about vaping here's the last article of today good news everyone misinformation about vaping could cost lives whoops well i wish somebody would have gave the author some balls because it's it's not that it could cost lives it's going to cost lives governments and the media are still spreading needless fear about this life-saving technology oh jesus one thing free-market liberals and public health campaigners can agree on is the importance of education if people don't know the risks they can't make an informed decision whoops annie status sometimes take this too far everyone knows that smoking is bad for their health they don't need gruesome photos on cigarette packs to let them know because they already know it get [ __ ] with the principle the basic principle of sound people need the facts and educating the public is one of the primary duties of health agencies alas they are failing while campaigners have been busy demanding health warnings on alcohol and more labels on food the public's knowledge about electronic cigarettes has been going backwards as a recent report from public health england concluded perceptions of the harm caused by vaping compared with smoking are increasingly out of line with the scientific evidence the proportion of smokers in england who think vaping is as dangerous or more dangerous in smoking rose from 36 percent to 53 percent and less than a third of smokers believe correctly the vaping is less harmful than smoking and 40 percent of them wrongly believe that nicotine causes cancer to be fair to british public health agencies they have generally tried to debunk the anti-vaping myths and unfortunately the situation is worse in the rest of europe where governments have been ambivalent or antagonistic towards electronic cigarettes the recently published euro barometer survey which we just looked at in the previous article shows that among those who have little or no experience of vaping only 20 percent think the electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products help smokers quit one study found that 59 of europeans wrongly believe that vaping is as dangerous or more dangerous than smoking that study was carried out in 2018 and the figure is probably even higher today given the relentless anti-vaping scare stories that have since proliferated and even today you can see them proliferate across the internet and across the interwebs the u.s has been in the grip of a full-blown moral panic about electronic cigarettes for several years and its junk science has dripped into the british and european press [Applause] experiments on mice zebra fish and other small animals have been inappropriately extrapolated to humans yeah like we did with the mice the cumulative effect of dozens of scary headlines has dealt a blow to the public's confidence in vaping as a safer substitute for smoking the 2019 outbreak of so-called avali which is a shitty title a shitty acronym electronic cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury i should have called it black heart disease because that's where it came from black market illicit thc cartridges whoops well it was confined to north america but it wasn't confined to north america in the media it was a global news story yeah people like to hear all kinds of bad [ __ ] despite what people say they don't like hearing good news it's boring they want to hear the juicy [ __ ] dripping blood traumatic injuries when people die well people pay attention but if you have some good news unless you're really into the the topic of conversation will people just skip right past it they don't care it's sad you would think people would be excited to see good news nope no not according to the views and it's not just you know me or my channel i see it all over the place how many people skip past good news stories well dozens of mostly young people died as a result of inhaling black market thc oil that had been adulterated with vitamin e acetate it had nothing to do with ordinary vaping but activists well they cynically exploited the incident to portray electronic cigarettes in the worst possible light the result is the people are more ignorant about vaping than they were 10 years ago when they first came onto the marketplace fear and suspicion has led to intolerance around 40 percent of european citizens are now in favor of banning electronic cigarette flavors that's up from 40 percent in 2017 and 71 percent of those who have little or no experience with vaping think that cigarettes should be regulated as strictly as tobacco get [ __ ] well in the united states because of what they slipped into the omnibus bill whoops well they're gonna be now matter of fact they're classified as the exact same thing even though they're not vaping is better than smoking why am i so irritated about this well imagine if water was classified as the same as vodka well they're both clear fluids and if you drank six gallons of water a day you would die yeah oh man haven't you seen that they're clearly not the same thing just the same as vaping is not the same thing as smoking a cigarette it's not the same thing as lighting tobacco on fire and breathing in that combustion the gas is made in that combustion state whoops nothing is combusted in a vaporized device in the tank it's heated to produce aerosolized vegetable glycerin but they don't care about that vaping is better than smoking the uk by contrast broadly embraced electronic cigarettes and has seen a dramatic decline in smoking prevalence between and 2019 the smoking rate fell by six percentage points from 20 to 14 by a neat coincidence six percent of british adults are regular vapers the only european union country with a lower smoking rate is sweden where smokers have switched to the smokeless tobacco product known as snooze which the european union and its infinite wisdom is banned everywhere else but even britain is not immune to anti-vaping misinformation and the number of vapors has barely decreased since 2016. millions of people continue to be dangerously misinformed and there is a job of work to be done to educate them just do it as the public health england report says greater emphasis needs to be placed on how best to communicate evidence of relative harm to smokers so that they can consider all the options available to them it is probably too much of hope for more responsible journalism bad news sells but governments charities and companies need to do more to get the facts out there's a film and i highly recommend you go watch it from the yorkshire cancer research and it's a great example of how to go about it electronic cigarettes and other reduced risk nicotine products are some of the great disruptive technologies of our time they have the potential to make smoking completely obsolete without infringing on personal choice and without costing the taxpayer a penny it would be a tragedy if their potential goes unfulfilled because of ignorance this is an amazing article unfortunately i don't know how widespread it's going to get because this kind of stuff doesn't get plastered all over the place only the stuff that gets plastered all over the place is well when they make fun of people or they ridicule people or when people get hurt the fear-mongering that goes like wildfire you know how hard it was this week to try and find the news until i remembered an old trick of oh well when you're doing a google search all you got to do to get rid of things that you don't want to see is put a little minus and then what it is that you don't want to see because the number one thing that every news agency across the world right now is talking about is how sean hannity was caught because he thought he was still on a break on a commercial break well he got caught vaping on tv he was using a jewel so you know his name's gonna be run through the mud right now because he was vaping well regardless of what you think of the man or not it's the perfect example of how bad press always sells and will always get plastered and retweeted and rebroadcast and republished on every website around but things that actually help people save lives stop people from getting cancer those things you have to go look for them if you really want to find out the truth uh anti-vaping propaganda is brain poison yeah it really is well ladies and gentlemen that wraps up the news for today march 19 2021 we've had some good news we've had some bad news we've got some science once again proving vaping is roughly equivalent to breathing air whoops at least on a level of the dna i mean how much more specific do you want to get we have millions of people on this planet that vape every single day we have people that have been vaping since the technology was first discovered and they're still alive today and their doctors if they're not told that they used to smoke well they can't see any evidence of any damage done by smoking because well they've been vaping for so long that the damage has been healed because your body has the natural ability to heal itself whoops well gotta spread the word my brothers and sisters in vaping you gotta spread the word vaping is better than smoking and that wraps it up for today i hope you guys all have a great weekend i appreciate you watching and i'll be back next week with another five on friday vaping new science and advocacy report have a great weekend [Music] do [Music] you"}
