{"DgShM2MmxBc": "- Today, I'll be reviewing\nthe LAMY AL-star black EMR which is a pen that is\ncompatible with the Wacom One and other types of Wacom\nEMR-enabled tablets and phones. The Al-star is a popular pen\namong traditional artists, but I'll be putting it to the test from a digital artist's perspective. Quick disclaimer, Lamy sent\nme this pen unconditionally to review in this sponsored video, but as always, all opinions\nin this video are my own. So, let's start with an overview of the pen and what it can do. The Al-star black EMR is based\non the rollerball version of the Al-star which is widely used for handwriting and inking. The Al-Star EMR brings the\nfamiliar feel of an analog pen to the digital domain\nwith a build that feels more like a traditional pen than a stylus. Gone are the rollerball\ntip and ink cartridges which have been replaced\nwith a standard plastic nib and battery-free EMR technology. This allows the Al-star\nEMR to draw on a display using pen pressure to vary the size, opacity and other digital art properties. Now, let's dive a bit\ndeeper into this device. The shape and form of the\nLamy Al-star is really the main selling point here. If you're looking for a pen that offers a more natural writing\nand drawing experience than what is offered by\nyour standard Wacom stylus, the Al-star is a good option. It features an ergonomic design that, at first glance, appears much thicker than the pen that comes\nwith the Wacom One, but after removing the pen cap, the end that you hold is\nabout the same thickness as the Wacom One's pen. The main difference being the\nAl-star has a triangular grip, while the Wacom One's pen is rounded. The Al-star has a glossy plastic grip. I'm used to having a rubbery grip, so that felt a little odd at first, but it didn't take much getting used to. Because the Al-start EMR does not require batteries or charging, it\nfeels light and nicely balanced as long as you don't put\nthe cap on the backside. It's made out of matte\nblack anodized aluminum and the body of the pen\nis flat on two sides and rounded on the others\nwhich keeps the pen from rolling off of your desk. A nice thick cap protects\nthe tip of the Al-star and it includes a metal\nclip to keep the pen safe and easily accessible in your pocket. The Al-star features over\n4,000 pen pressure levels which can be used to\nmake thick and thin lines or brush strokes that\nare more or less opaque. Artists will appreciate\nthis feature for drawing and painting, but the\nhigh pressure sensitivity also makes handwriting look and feel very close to analog writing. During my line tests, I found the Al-star EMR performed well. The lines are not wobbly and\nthe pen pressure tapers nicely. The only issue I had\nwas with the lighter end of the pen pressure being\na bit difficult to detect. This made it hard for me\nto do light sketching. I think this is more\ndue to the rubbery grip of the nib which we will discuss next. The nib or tip of the pen\nis 0.7 millimeters thick, which is perfect for\nboth writing and drawing. The nibs on the Al-star have more of a more rubbery-feeling\ngrip on the surface of the display compared\nto the standard Wacom nibs which feel more slippery on the Wacom One. This has a tendency to make\nit more difficult to draw with very light pressure as the friction causes the pen to skip along the surface. However, the added friction\ndoes add some stability to medium and heavy pressure strokes which does feel nice if you\nare inking or taking notes. The nib also has some\nspringiness to it that dampens the sound of the pen tip on\nthe surface of the display. The Al-star EMR comes with two spare nibs. There is also a metal ring\nthat is used to bite down on the nib to remove it. Fortunately, if you don't\nlike the feeling of the nib that comes with the\nLAMY AL-star black EMR, you can swap it out with\none of the standard nibs that comes with the Wacom One, if you want that slicker feeling on the surface of the tablet. I recommend that you go ahead and do this if you want the best drawing\nexperience on the Wacom One. Pen tilt is supported\non the Al-star black EMR which will let you shade\nwith the side of your pencil in apps that support pen tilt. I find that when you tilt the default nib, it has too much friction and\nmakes it difficult to draw, so definitely swap the nib out\nfor one of the Wacom One nibs if you're going to be shading like this. On the grip of the pen is a\nsmall button that may be able to be programmed within your\nart or writing application to perform a function. For example, it may be used\nto invoke an erasing mode. Most digital pens I have\nused require you to press the button with your index finger, or at least that's how\nI've always done it. The Al-star's button is\nplaced low on the grip, so it has to be pressed with your thumb. This may take some getting\nused to if you're like me. The button is inset\nrather than being raised above the surface of the grip. There isn't a good way to\nfeel where the button is without looking, so in my opinion, it would have been better\nto have the button raised a bit and located near\nthe front of the grip. The Al-star is compatible\nwith the Wacom One, Samsung Galaxy Note and other types of Wacom EMR-enabled devices. You can find a list of compatible\ndevices on Lamy's website. So now, I'll do a quick\nhandwriting and drawing demo with the Al-star. We'll start with the handwriting demo. Handwriting on the Wacom One feels nice. You have the option of\nusing the default nib which has more friction\nand will make your lines more stable, or if you want\na looser feel to the pen, you can use a nib from the Wacom One. Moving on to the drawing demo. Drawing with the Al-star feels comfortable even during long drawing sessions. I did this quick doodle\nfrom imagination here. Just drawing in pencil first and then going over it with ink. So as you can see, I'm\nable to use this pen not only as a ink pen but also as a pencil or a paintbrush and it also works well for navigating my computer. The Al-star EMR is an\nexcellent pen for handwriting, painting and inking. It's refreshing to work with\na pen that feels more analog. And I'm happy to recommend\nit to anyone who wants a pen that feels more like a pen\nand less like a stylus. If you'd like to pick one up for yourself, I'll put a link down in\nthe video description.

Thanks for watching and\nI'll see you next time.", "YDfUpXgGZ3w": "this video is brought to you by - lien one of my main men my big brother of sorts in this youtube tech community isaac AKA canoopsy sent me a text yesterday as I was slowly passing out while doing homework in a common area at my university and he said hey dude check this product out is pretty intriguing and I was like okay I clicked the link I saw what it was I saw the ratings and I saw the price and I immediately clicked by now and this thing shipped to me within 24 hours and arrived at my doorstep this morning and today we're gonna find out if this product the stylus pen super fine nib active capacitive sold on Amazon for about $40 USD $50 Canadian is in fact a good and effective and affordable Apple pencil alternative for iPad Mini iPad air iPad 10.2 and iPad pro 11 and 12 point 9 but before we get into this I really appreciate it if you leave a like on this video comment if you have any questions suggestions or opinions as the YouTube algorithm likes that and will help push this content to more people so as you can see I have a literal pile of iPads that will work with this device but first let's unbox it here slides out just like the Apple pencil box but you know cheaper it's a cheaper box obviously and we're immediately greeted with a user manual that says capital iPad active capacity pen opening it up we can see there are some diagrams of it how to use it etc definitely comes in handy but I'll put that over to the side and here is the actual stylus right off the bat it looks exactly like an Apple pencil first generation I have a second gen right here very similar in diameter the alternative is definitely lighter but still it maintains a form factor that is comfortable to write with in the hand and I can say that because I use a 2nd gen apple pencil to write notes like everyday you can also see there's a USB type-c import for charging and they do include a USB type-c cable in the box so and I'm happy to see this I'm glad they're jumping to a more universal connector rather than micro USB you also get a little condom I mean cap for your stylus here and you also get a replaceable nib if yours wears down so while that's all well and good how does this thing actually work with iPads let's start off with my main daily driver device the iPad pro point-9 I take notes on this device anytime I'm in class for calculus microeconomics and I write my planner here so I am always using the Apple pencil okay so first let's connect this device it says touch the top of the capacitor pen lightly the light will turn on quickly and the capacitor pen will enter the working mode so let's do that I will tap it here and a light does come on and it immediately connected doe right off the bat this feels like I'm navigating through iPad OS with my second gen apple pencil I'll be it cannot attach to my iPad but the same thing goes for the first gen Apple pencil which costs double this stylus right here so let me open up a pretty typical multitasking situation here that involves the Apple pencil I'm doing math homework so let's write out this problem here so 19 F of negative 2 is undefined I'm just copying this down just for the sake of writing with the pencil and immediately this is a comfortable experience it's smooth the typical Ides across the display just like you want with the more expensive Apple pencil I don't think that there's any pressure sensitivity let's test that out real quick I'll get the pencil tool in the Apple Notes app so let's choose that here we go so yeah we only have one pressure sensitivity here but hear me out if you are a student like me you're writing notes all the time you're doing homework is that the biggest deal no because as you can see right here I can do you know do some math here f of X of 3x over 2 or the limit of H approaches 0 is equal to whatever I'm supposed to be learning X plus h minus f of X over H like this is comfortable this is smooth I already enjoy writing with it let's go to my econ notes and I'll write an imaginary definition here so I don't know supply and demand or related if you're an economist you're probably cringing but you know there you go here I'm writing it's really comfortable it's really smooth and yeah I mean for 40 bucks I am very satisfied with this let's try this stylus with another great device the iPad Mini 5th generation which supports the Apple pen so first gents let's go into I don't know notability let's just say so let's make sure the pen is on reset it maybe and here we are connected easy as pie so let's look up notability so let's get to writing hello oh that's just great handwriting right there that costs 40 so yeah I mean just a really nice smooth experience in notability here in good notes once again this works with any newer Apple device the iPad Mini 5th gen the iPad 10.2 which I have over here the iPad ar3 and the newest 3rd gen iPad pro 11 and iPad pro 12 point 9 but before we continue with this stylus review we have a quick word from our sponsor once again this video is brought to you by dashlane a streamlined and intuitive

your devices for 30 days no credit or debit card required at checkout let's try this out with the iPad 10.2 inch here a great budget iPad for schoolwork and note-taking as I said in my full review so let's go back into I don't know it's going to OneNote so here's a previous note let's make a little bullet point maybe hoops ins to say hey I'm making a note yeah I mean like this is literally a cheaper Apple pencil first-generation without the pressure sensitivity so like I said if you are an artist that might be a big deal but if you're an everyday person you want to take notes you want to interact with pad OS with a fine point of input for example if we go into Adobe Lightroom here you might want to adjust things with the fine tip of the pen here rather than your fat finger this device will do the trick and honestly if this fits your requirements I don't really see a reason why you should buy the first an Apple pencil over this one especially because the charging situation is a lot less awkward you don't have a lightning connector sticking out of the tip of the pen here you have it conveniently placed the USB type-c port once again and this thing costs $40 USD $50 Canadians so very affordable - and with the money that you're saving buying this alternative stylus you may as well opt for a more expensive iPad like the iPad air 3 so if you really want the Apple pencil iPad set up it's more attainable by once again buying this cheaper substitute in comparison to the more expensive first gen Apple pencil but when you compare it to the second gen pencil this is where it gets more competitive if you have an iPad pro 11 or 12 point 9 if you're choosing between these two you're really choosing between a cheaper price versus pressure sensitivity and immense convenience as we know the 2nd gen pencil attaches to the side of the iPad and charges there it's so convenient to have it there at my disposal whatever versus this this would be in a pocket or pouch you know it has more of a chance to get lost and it doesn't charge nearly as conveniently I have to pull it a cord and plug it into the wall versus this I pull it off I use it for whatever I'm doing I slap it back on the side it's charging it's always connected convenient but once again if I primarily use an iPad Mini fifth generation an iPad 10.2 inch or an air three and my writing stylus oriented tasks didn't involve pressure sensitivity like I said note-taking for school as I've said I would honestly buy this stylus over the Apple pencil 1st generation it has a less awkward charging method and it's half the cost so I will leave a link in the video description if you're interested in this product I am certainly impressed by it and thank you once again to isaac for bringing my attention to it and that about wraps things up I hope this video was helpful and informative I'll be leaving two links in the description one to our sponsor dashlane check them out once again if you're interested in the second two this great Apple pencil alternative I'd really appreciate it once again if you leave a like on this video comment if you have any questions suggestions or opinions and subscribe for more

Kinnaird get this removed from the review on [Music] what's up guys and welcome back to another episode of JP reviews I hope you guys are having a blessed and an amazing day out there today I'm not using my normal camera because I usually use my blue Fuji film but I'm starting to like this Canon camera better because it has way better lighting now it doesn't have 60 frames per second but it does have 10 eggie and that's fine with me I hope it's fine with you guys - that's totally different in the subject of today today we are buying a new stylist for my iPad so I could be able to draw way easier and I saw one in Walmart that girl zero long and we ain't too expensive but it's not like those expensive Apple stylist is either I hope this one works for the iPad we're gonna buy it we're gonna test it we're gonna film a four of you for you guys and hope you guys enjoy so if you're looking for a stylist to see if this is a great budget one for you guys so without any further ado as always let's jump right in we're at Walmart the big store this product we are looking for will be found in the electronic area where the iPad stuff is let me go find that here it is black web rechargeable active stylus mister came here get this removed from the review thank you for shopping alright so first we're going to look at the specs it is a rechargeable stylist and then lasts 12 hour battery life and has a fine tip for precision driving and drawing that's one of the main reasons I bought this thing for and has all the other specs here in back and yeah good buys this at Walmart for 22 bucks and has the charger now we got whoa on that thing we got a trusty little might feel that you always see me used in the unbox and we're gonna open this thing up and see how it looks like inside alright so we got a little piece of small tape right here but unless you like cut that thing open and take it out [Music] I can get out and here it is outside of the box oh actually feels really nice like a real pen has a great feel to our thousand be way lighter but it is not has a real fine tip pick it up show you guys the real fine tip on that thing very nice and then it has this right here for the charging port now that part is also a stylus as well as one of the those are oval like rounded off stylists not the start pen one but if you want to use this one you could totally go right ahead this is the power button let's see if it turns off straight off the box and it does so I might give us a little more charging and then we'll get right back into testing this thing now we're probably gonna test it with an iPad 2 because that's what I have so we're gonna see if it works and if it links and you think you need Bluetooth board still gonna try it out so uh here we go now I have my iPad 2 here and we're gonna see how this thing works it is it through bluetooth or not let's see it's powered on and it works no Bluetooth at all [Music] let's see what this thing can do now I got some drawing apps here we're going to try out to see if this thing works [Music] let's see here [Music] not too bad working so far perfect for drawing now I would totally recommend one of these gloves when you're using this for drawing because since this isn't Bluetooth it doesn't have the palm rejection which means if I try to use the palm it'll draw where my palm is touching the screen and not where the pen is so it is not bluetooth I will totally recommend one of those gloves to when you put your palm down it doesn't draw or do anything or where the stylus is but this is like perfect you get different colors and they go for red here [Music] and you can go the eraser now I wouldn't recommend using this without a screen protection because I just wouldn't take the chance and scratching the actual screen with this even though I'm pretty sure it won't scratch anything at all I just want to take that chance me personally grace that and yeah this thing is working perfectly fine let's see how it works with some notes [Music] welcome leblanc never use this before not now let's just try to add some notes okay so it's typing let's go [Music] for those of you who use your finger like me to just do slow types this is like perfect I'm not gonna say that even though automatically did and you can also use this side right here as I said as you can see it's also a great stylist I would use this more when I'm using it for like the screen when I'm drawing and doing more stuff that I need the tip I would use this part and yeah this is perfect you can also do some good reading and a lot of stuff with us [Music] [Music] see you could copy easier [Music] biggest found in all these times in Genesis this is a super great stylist for also reading you could insist like one of the best and the cheapest ones I'd only paid 22 bucks for this if we were to buy an Apple stylist but even though it's a lot better cost you an arm and a leg but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this stylist I'm gonna rape this stylist I'll totally wring it a 4.5 out of 5 it is one of the best ones I've seen out there for a cheapest price now if you were to use this just totally for drawing I wouldn't totally recommend it because it is not like blue tooth I will recommend more like a Wacom or a bamboo fine line those are one of the best but of all if you don't want one of those for because of the price too expensive or you just don't totally want to use it for drawing I will totally recommend this because this is great for typing for if you just want to use this side and a stylus if you want to do a little bit of drawing if you want to do some writing taking some notes this is like the perfect one for that and I want it I can all in one so that I bought this one and it worked out perfectly fine has a 12 hour battery life this is magnetized I think I told you that earlier so is this thing gonna be lost and it has I believe it has this power saving mode so every 30 minutes it will automatically turn off now I think it said when egg is about to die it will like blink it will like do some blinking for like 10 seconds then the HeartMath we power off and that means you have to charge it so yeah it is uh has a comment came with a charger right here but I since I already have an Android I don't really need that it came also with a small little instruction manual showing you how you do the simple stuff but that's almost unnecessary just take it out of the box you power it and it just starts working that's how simple this thing is no Bluetooth needed and a very fine tip and I'll be using the stylus a lot more than my finger because sometimes I finger does get tired and if you want to use drawing I'll totally recommend one of these gloves for that I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you like this camera better than the other one please tell me in the comment section below and if you have any other questions about that stylus also leave your comments down there and in fact any more ideas cuz I have some great ideas for some prop more product reviews I saw in Walmart there I really want to check out and some fishing challenges and budget challenges and all sorts of fun stuff so subscribe to the channel and if you want to support the channel I have an eBay store listed in the description below right sell a bunch of cool things if you want to pick up one of the items definitely checking out but I hope you guys enjoy the video if you want to see the video YouTube recommends hit the one down here if you want to see the latest video I posted hit the one right here and if you want to join JP nation hit the bar right up here so until next time this is Josiah signing out [Music] [Music]", "0yRnxus4yzw": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Chris's cool stuff and other neat things I am Chris and what I have for you today is a little bit of a artistic tech review so I am a little bit new to drawing with a stylus on a screen I do have a Hui on pen display but I don't use it that often because in order to use it I really have to devote I'm sitting here in front of the computer so due to the unfortunate passing of one of my closest friends I was left his Apple iPad so I'm just starting to get used to doing digital drawings and paintings on a tablet now it is fifth generation iPad so it is too old to use the Apple pencil so I was looking for other methods of using the stylus with it the stylus I have currently is one of these guys here that if you can see it got those little little discs on the tip of the stylus it works pretty well but it's still that this is having the stylus at the end gonna kind of gives me the perception that the the tip is a lot thicker than it actually is and sometimes to make the drawing a little bit awkward I do watch a lot of art related videos on YouTube and just the other day a video popped up on my feed that was reviewing a fine tip stylus for non iPad pro devices or even older iPads before they were able to use that Apple pencil I went to Amazon I picked one of those styluses up right away and we're gonna go ahead and do a review alright so first up we're gonna do a little bit of an unboxing so the stylus comes in this white box because he just says stylus pen super fine nib active capacitive what you do is you just slide the tray out exposing the contents back there so we have a package inside this this card essentially giving you the information about customer support happy on this side unhappy on this side put that aside next off we have this little case for your pen or stylus we have the drawing glove it's great that this came with one because I do have a glove that came with my pen display and it is starting to fall apart so I was in need of one of these people say that these gloves are to help minimize friction between your hand and the screen but also for me I find them very important because in the event that you don't have a higher quality stylus that has palm rejection these help keep your palm from touching the screen and going up your drawing next we have the user we have the charging cable so USB USB see and here is the stylus so the back which is one of those are more wide nibs that just pops off its head held on magnetically that pops off and right there is the charging port and right here is the power button so all you got to do is power this on and it's ready to work it's not bluetooth so you don't need to pair it with your device so the directions you can tell that this was definitely a Chinese product just based on the way that the directions were written definitely not written by somebody whose first language was English and we go through some of the details here first off product features stylish and minimalistic style aluminum alloy in piano baking varnish calm and luxurious novel and durable number two made of pure copper fine nib provides smooth and excellent writing feel whose friendly interaction keeps away from scratches number three is compatible with 98% of capacitive touchscreen devices on the market like smartphones tablets etc number four product enables to be continuously used for up to five days under full charge and auto pour off after 30 minutes without and use no calculated in two hour two hours per day let's go ahead put this guy over rice ELISA week one on how to use please press the button directly on the top of the pen the blue light will quickly turn on the act act of capacitive pen enters into a working mode sorry not into a working mode into V working mode number two now you can use complete in operations like clicking sliding and etc on the screen of phones tablets or laptops through the pen instead of finger you can also use the pen to write paint in specific apps when you press I'm sorry number three when you press the button again the active capacitive pen enters into shutdown this date the pen will automatically enter shutdown state every 30 minutes during the use so I'm guessing that means not during use I'm saying if it's not used after 30 minutes they'll shut down automatically at least that's what I hope because why if it shuts down on you while you're using it there's definitely not a very advantageous aspect to this pen okay so how to charge you can charge a pen battery in three ways please use a standard USB to mini-usb data cable to charge connect one end to the Pens USB interface and the other to the USB interface of the tablet or computer please connect sorry number two please connect one end of the data cable to the pen and the other end to an SV DC power adapter the number three please connect one end of the data cable to the pen and each other to the SV power bank note at the bottom during this is kind of coming here during not charging but during char wicking chair reading process the red indicator is on the charging times is one to two hours when is fully charged the red indicator will auto off so I do have it plugged in and charging right now and I'll have to say it says the red indicator is on right now the indicator is green so I don't know what that actually means it says it when it's red one is charging and it's off when it's done does green mean it's done maybe I don't know okay so I just want to apologize in advance I really haven't quite figured out how I'm gonna get the camera set up when I'm filming the drawing right now I'm gonna be dodging a tripod right here in front of me with it bump the camera I definitely apologize so here I've already said this is a Autodesk SketchBook Pro this is a free program I can get online I've already set my color to black and I selected a thicker line weight so hopefully you can see the image in the video let's go ahead and turn on so I've already heard on other reviews that there tends to be a lot of line jitter with this pen and you know what and they were not kidding so let's go ahead and try to draw a diagonal line here and you can see how wavy that is and I don't have a hard edge ruler available when we see if I can go find something here there's a note so this is definitely a straight line here you can see how wavy that is so initially I didn't think that was gonna be too much of a big deal because sketchbook has this line prediction so even though it's drawing wavy the program recognizes that I'm trying to draw a straight line and it straightens it out so that being said let's see if we're able to do any nice artwork with this pen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] okay so you may notice that I am in different clothes so this is two days after I started doing the review but we've come down to it now it is the time for the moment of truth let's start off on a positive note so we'll go through some of the pros on this pen first off it is inexpensive I've got mine for her I think it was just like 20 21 dollars on Amazon Amazon Prime that free shipping here in two days so that was super cool depen maybe it does feel solid it's like the night feels nice in my hand it's a nice solid pen doesn't feel like it's cheaper or anything and it came with that glove that I needed since my other one was ripping so I want to say that's pretty much all the pros I can come up with let's go ahead and remove or move on over to the cons so as you may have guessed it from the video I did kind of ragequit that picture I was working on the line jitter was so bad that the particular line functionality in sketchbook was very little help there were so many points in time were even sketchbook had no idea what I was trying to do had other instances where the line would be jotted as if the iPad or the pen thought I removed the pen from the surface and Amelia won't lie back so it's a tall dotted so I ended up doing another picture offline and I gotta say here it is and I'll do a picture at the end of the video to see exactly what it is but I mean it's not a super complicated drawing it's just like a simple cartoony character basic colors this should have been a quick sketch and even this was a struggle to get finished definitely way too much time put into this then to be and by the way I said when I was reading in the instruction manual that it powers down after 30 minutes I assumed that meant after 30 minutes of inactivity but they were 100% true to their word it powers off after 30 minutes so there was numerous times when I was trying to do the drawing then also I lost all functionality and I couldn't remember I had no idea why I looked down at the pen and sure enough power was off the no idea why they would want that to happen makes more sense to power down after inactivity non during use so at the end of the day I can only come to one simple conclusion this is not a pen for artists there's no way you can do any quality work with this pen maybe it's good for students who need to take notes but that's the only thing that I can see would be useful so if you are in the market for a stylus to use with your older tablets or phones for doing quick doodles or drawings do not get this you'll regret it every step of the way if you have any questions at all please let me know in the comment section down below I do thank you for stopping by again my name is Chris and I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "miybeIlE-e8": "I literally got thousands of messages on\nInstagram from people asking me what stylus to use on your phone so I went\nonto Amazon to search for the best stylus pens and because I couldn't\ndecide which one I wanted, I ended up buying all of these. And I can tell you right\nnow - don't do that - it would be a massive mistake! As it turns out, I spent so much\nmore money then I needed too and you'll see why in just a minute. But now that I\nhave them all we'll try them out so we can find out together which one is best.\nYou'll also notice that the Apple pencil is missing from my collection here\nbecause unfortunately the Apple pencil doesn't work on the phone. Why Apple?? I think there's so many of would love to have an Apple Pencil for the iPhone. Let me know the comments if you\nare one of them, maybe we can send this whole list of comments to Apple and\nmaybe they'll listen to us - you never know! Alright so let's see what we can do\ninstead the first thing we're going to do is have a quick look at all our\ncontenders and then we'll put them through some very rigorous testing to\nsee which one performs best the mistake I made when I ordered all\nthese stylus pens is that I didn't really understand how they work. You see\nthe iPhone is made to be used with your fingers where a certain amount of his\nskin touches the screen that's why you'll see a lot of these effective sort\nof stylus pens sort of like these ones they pretty much emulate your fingers\nbut the problem is that they're not very precise you can't really tell exactly\nwhere you are touching the screens that's why companies have come up with\nstylus pens that have a little disc at the bottom like this one here. I was\npersonally never afraid of these stylus pens and I've never tried one until now\nI much more favored pens with the super thin tips kind of like the Apple\npencil sort of like this where it's really really fine and you can see I have\na whole collection of them here okay let's group these pens the first group\nhere is what we call capacitive pens they used the touch functionality of the\nscreen just like your finger would and then we have this group of pens here\nwhich are sometimes called active pens and you can see here on the box that's\nwhat they call it but they actually active capacitive pens they have the\nfine tip we're looking for and you'll notice that now all powered you have to\ncharge them with a USB cable but they are not connected via bluetooth as it\nturns out these pens have been engineered to simulate the white touch\nof your finger with some electricity magic technically speaking it's called\nreflective electrostatic but all you need to know is that if you see the\naccuracy of a finer tip stylus without requiring a digitizer in the display or\nBluetooth connectivity which brings us to the next category and that includes\nstylus pens which connect via bluetooth and they've worked in conjunction with\nthe digitizer off the screen of course each one of these types of stylus pins\nhas pros and cons and that's what makes it so hard to decide which one to get so\na comic was the ultimate stylus test challenge to rate each one of these\npins and they will see how they compare you'll probably want to use the stylus\nfor a variety of tasks so app looking to the following categories how to never\nget your phone back to take no and then you probably want to create\nsome art like sketching drawing and painting and then of course we are also\ngoing to look at lettering and calligraphy because this is really like\npassion and then of course we also take the price into consideration because as\nyou will see there's a huge difference in price between all these different\npins so now let's look at the contenders of the challenge I've put them here in\nthe order of price and we'll start with tasting the cheapest pins first and then\nwe go all the way up to the most expensive one to see every ready to\nspend that much money alright so we've got our scoring sheet ready to go you\ncan see here all that stylus pins with their names so we've got our freebie pin\nhere this is one that I got when I ordered an iPhone case many years ago\nI've no idea I got it from but I've been using it for a little bit so it goes on\nthe list this one is at stylist called home skin this comes in a pack of three\nlet me show you so this is their packaging and it's also got a yellow and\nevery opinion they were just fine any of you know you can leave them in different\nplaces three of them is eleven dollars then next up we have this Kim C active\nstylus pen this kind of looks like a black Apple pencil in it really feels\nlike the first generation Apple pencil tip it's black so this one is $22 and\nthen we have the active stylus pin by a company called so cool I don't know how\nto pronounce it it's is CLL and again this also looks like a first generation\nApple pencil similar rate as well and this one is $25 and then we have this\npretty stylin see you know this one's pink so this is pretty cool this is the\nmock car universe so active stylus pin and you can see the difference here\nbetween the previous one this one has the fine tip but then it's also got this\nfat tip at the back you could be handy you can never know next one up is the\ndonut pro 4 this one is a capacitive stylus this is not an active stylus so\nthis doesn't need any charging and this one is $28 so this\nit's quite expensive for a stylist that doesn't have any electronics but it's\ngot this little disc here at the front and then we have the stylus that looks\nlike the second-generation Apple pencil it's also got this flat part here it's\nnot super useful because the Apple pencil uses this for charging but this\none doesn't get charged here this one actually gets charged here you can see\nhere this is that USB charging port and this one is $30 and the next in our\nlineup we have the dominant - 3 stylus pin this one is actually a little bit\nfancy this is a little bit metallic unlike the other one said that all\nplastic this feels quite nice although I have to say this is quite light but it's\ngot a really nice fine tip here and this one is $37 and then of course we also\nhave a stylus bike on which is the back on bamboo fine line this one is for six\ndollars so this is quite a bit more expensive the nice thing about this is\nthat you can sort of open it up and turn it on almost like a real pin which is\nkind of cool and then the fine tip comes out having said that this tip is a\nlittle bit wobbly some bit concerned about this but so far this is quite cool\nit's got sort of a slightly triangular shape so this feels quite nice in my\nhand and then last but not least we have the only active stylus pin which\nactually connects to bluetooth to the device and this is the a doughnut pixel\nstylus I've had this for a while this is not one that I bought new I bought this\na few years ago to compare it was the able pencil on the iPad I didn't like it\nthat much so it's been sitting in my cupboard for a very long time but I\nthought for this challenge why not bringing out and see how it appears to\nall the other stylus pins alright so now that we have their overview we know all\nour contenders let's grab the phone and let's try them out so now before we get\nstarted I also want to mention that the phone I'm using for this test it's the\niPhone XS max this is not an iPhone 11 Pro this is the previous generation and\none of the reasons why I keep this phone and didn't upgrade to the new one last\nyears because the new iPhones don't have 3d patch in\nand while it's not a crucial feature not really something that you would miss too\nmuch to me it was still a feature that I quite appreciate and that's why I\ndecided to keep this iPhone having say that there's going to be new iPhones\ncoming out later this year and I don't think that not having 3-d patch will\nprevent me from getting a new iPhone this time around alright now it's time\nfor the piece and to speed things up a little bit I'm going to do this taste in\ngroups so the first group we are going to look at are the capacitive stylus\npins so we've got our freebies we've got the whole skin and then we've also got\nthe garnet pro 4 they are all pretty similar which means they don't need any\npower they connect to any device that you might have and they all work very\nsimilar we're going to use that procreate for all the piece because as\nthe egg I really like using for creativity and the good thing about\nusing the appropriate pop of it is that using the stylus pins in this means\nit'll work for other apps on your phone as well such as the note said or maybe\nif you have two good notes or any other note-taking app it will work as well\nthere freebie stylus pen this is the one I've been using a lot and you know it's\nnot ready it kind of works really fast but it's just not very precise so if you\nwanted to do something that needs a little bit more precision such as\ndoodling it's pretty hard to know where the lines start and stop so this is not\nreally ideal now having their slightly smaller tip\nlet's see what the difference is with this so you can see already I have much\nmore precision over my lines and then zooming in gives me quite a nice amount\nof precision here and then we have there this stylus and of course this is the\nbest one because I can really see where I'm doing my lines so this is very\nprecise and this one works actually quite nicely\nright now it's tiresome littering and maybe a little bit of calligraphy and\nagain using that freebie stylus first so you can see it's a living wobbly and you\ncan see already how much more precise I am using\nthis stylus pin and then their third one so I would say out of these three stylus\npins this one here is the clear winner this is my father uses to use it has no\nleg and it's actually quite precise alright so now let's move on to our next\nset of pins and this includes all of the pins yeah so now we have six different\nones and this is probably the mistake I made because they all have the exact\nsame problem and I'll show you right now what that is so let's just pick the\nfirst one which is their embassy and let's turn it on\nand all you have to do is press this little button and then it sort of turns\non and now let's do the same case that we've done with the other pin so as you\ncan see navigation is actually quite nice so let's try some doodles and it's\nnot too bad but you can see how already this line is quite wobbly and you know\nit was at me because I've used the stylus pins before and this line was not\nas wobbly with the other pin so it's definitely the stylus creating these\nweird wobbly lines so drawing straight lines is okay but then as soon as I\nstart drawing these diagonal lines you can see how wobbly this is so this is\nsome major drawback and I'm actually very disappointed about this and the bad\nnews is is that all these pins have exactly the same problem so no matter\nwhich one of these pins you choose they all create these wobbly lines I show you\nso let's just choose all of them and let's see if there is more or less\nwobble between them so I'm just gonna do the same again so I think the so-called\nactive stylus is worse the black one here now let's try out pink stylus this\nis at least this one is very pretty so let's see if this one works a little bit\nbetter so I'm going to do the exact same test we're going to draw a circle and\nthen some diagonal lines and you can see it's got the exact same problem you can\nlisten the problem a little bit by drawing faster so the faster you draw\nthe least more obvious that Wiggles are but unfortunately it still got this\nproblem as well so this pin has stood\nVantage that it's got the effect tip on the other side as well so if you wanted\nto draw lines like this then you can do that with the other side and so this is\nmuch better other than that the stylus pen actually\nworks nicely very precise for navigation and also for painting this is quite nice\nSophie choose a different brush and we do a little bit of painting this is\nactually quite nice to use so this one is that King those stylus\nthis is the one that looks like that second generation April paint so let's\nsee how this works so this one turns on at the back so gonna turn on it just to\nbe fair let's choose black as well so now I have to actually press down quite\nhard in order to select the color so this is already something I don't like\nso much so it's not just like taping on the dot you can see I have to press it\ndown quite hard so I don't like this so much but now let's see how it performs\nwhen we draw our circle so this is not much different to the stylus pins I've\ntried previously all right so now these are all in a similar price range and\nthen now we've got the donut there's three and also they're like common\nstylus pen so you'd think that because they were expensive they might work a\nlittle bit better so let's see how these two stylist pins perform so it with the\nID on it there she turned on at the back here and it turns on it's got a little\ngreen light there so now it's on so now let's see how this performs and you can\nsee this is quite disappointing because even though this is a mood spin\nsubstance pin it has got the exact same problem as the other stylus pins so\nunfortunately this is not better than these ones so now we've got our last\nhope which is the most expensive styles pin out of all of them which is the\nbamboo fineline pin and one of the benefits with this pin is that you can\npair it with the app so let's see if that makes a difference so it's better\nmodify and then let's go to preferences and connect third-party stylus so now we\nhave welcome here in the it says turn the stylus on to connect it and you can\nsee now it comes and it's connected and also but this\nstylus pen you can see it's got different selections here so you can\nselect right-handed or left-handed and then also your writing style upward or\ndownward and I'm not quite sure what mine is mine is kind of in the middle so\nI'm just going to leave it at right-handed and didn't see what happens\nhere sweetie Hey and and now we're gonna do the same\ntaste again and see what happens if this is actually either obtain the other pins\nwe've tried so we're gonna do it the exact same taste again and it is a\nlittle bit bigger so this is quite a lot better actually than the wobbly lines we\nhave created before now let's do the diagonal taste as well and so this is\nactually a little bit better I have to say what I don't like about this stylus\npen is that it's got a slightly wobbly too so this was a bit similar to a\nstylus pen you get with your Microsoft Surface tablet for example they have a\nslightly wobbly cheap as well and it's one of the reasons why I don't like\nusing them so much that's why I much prefer using the iPad pro and Apple\npencil and as you can see this eliminates some of the bubbles but\nhaving said that it's also much more expensive all right so now last but not\nleast let's try out the doughnut peep salt stylus this one works worth\nbluetooth so we need to connect it to the phone first let's turn it on and\nthen let's connect it to bluetooth so now we need to go back to our settings\nhere and then connect third-party stylus and being a doughnut and you can see it\nhas already paired which is nice so this was very nice and fast it also allow you\nto customize these buttons here and again we have for that writing style\nthat you can choose from so now let's see how this performs so\nnow let's go through the taste again and draw the circle first and then also our\ndiagonal lines and while the stylus doesn't create that wobbly lines you can\nsee here that it's not very precise even though I'm touching the screen right\nhere it's that's drawing the line sort of outside so this definitely doesn't\nhelp me being more creative by having to worry exactly where I place\nthe pin on screen to me it should just work\nso for $77 I'm not sure whether it's good enough given that the April\npencil is $99 so I definitely don't recommend the stylus pen all right and\nnow let's bring back the iPad let's have a look at how these stylus pens kid in\ncomparison I think it's very easy to tell that we have a clear winner which\nis the donut Pro which is the stylus that has the transparent disc here at\nthe top and interestingly this is the stylus I didn't think I would like until\nI tried it and then in second place we have equal the hon Suki and also the\nWacom Bamboo Stylus and the hans keys going to get the silver meter just\nbecause it's so much cheaper there's a new stylus and really if you think about\nit the price difference is really not worth it the vacuum stylus is certainly\nnot that much better so I don't recommend that you waste your money on\nthis packet there Hans key stylus instead and now let's have a look at the\nscoring of the rest of the pins and you can see here they all score reasonably\nlow so I don't recommend that you get any of the other styluses that I have\ntried especially the ones that are called active stylus pins they're not\nreally that useful for art if all you do is taking notes and navigating your\nphone then those stylus pins are okay for the type of creative work that we\nlike doing so much I really don't recommend getting one of those stylus\npins now let's have a quick look at the rankings of the other pins and you'll\nnotice that I haven't given out too many fives I've only given out the 5 to the\n3v pin for the price because it doesn't get much better than free and then also\nthe Adoni pro 4 I gave it a 5 for taking notes I really found it's the be a\nstylus pen for taking notes because it has no leg and it's really fast and\nprecise and then also a 5 goes to devack combi boot fine light beam just for the\nbuild quality i really like the way it's made I like their triangular shape the\nmet blegh so overall this is a very nice looking stylus and then other than their\nI don't recommend any of the adult stylus piece especially for those of us\nwho like to do creative art don't be fooled by the name eggs of pain those\npaints really don't work that well the wobbly lines are super frustrating so I\nrecommend that you save your money and you don't buy one of those but speak to\nthat con ski stylus pen you get three for $11\nthis is really good value for money and it allows you to be creative on your\niPhone and now that you know which stylus pen to buy I really recommend\nthat you watch some of my other videos as well I'm gonna plug them up here and\nhere so that you can continue watching and learn how to be creative on your\niPhone with your new stylus pen

for\nwatching and I'll see my next video", "nfiOnDh_Unk": "hey and welcome to our short explanation and demonstration of various types of touchscreens what we're going to do here is explain the different types of screens and then we're going to test things like the typical rubber end that you may have played with through - a stylus from our friends at Microsoft three Dell styluses and then a generic stylus so let's just go through the history very quickly so you get caught up so you understand what the differences are there's really three different types of touch screens there's capacitive resistive and the digitizer so the capacitive and this will be very short by the way so capacitive is what they were invented in 65 at they started catching on in the mid 1980s a capacitive touchscreen consists of glass panel with a capacitive charge storing material coated on surface basically just a coating and when you push on it circuits located in the corner of the screen gases - exactly where you are which means it's not as accurate as you might like the next type is resistive it we're gonna be very short on this because it's not something that's used heavily today basically all it is is an overlay on the screen and there's a there's really three layers there's a screen behind which has a positive charge there's a spacer that's transparent you can't see and then there's a negatively charged piece of plastic or glass on top and when you push on it you're literally touching the two pieces together you're closing the gap between that spacer and the front and the back piece and that is how it is figuring out where you are the problem with this is it doesn't feel very nice it's not very precise it's relatively cheap and that the only place I see it today is in cars so you'll you might feel it on your touchscreen of your car the next and the newest are the digitizers now digitizers are you get your glass panel and then on top of that you have a grid and it's transparent you can't see it but there's a lot of vertical and horizontal lines and an active stylus will pick it up and we're going to explain that that's these three here and ball Plus this one that's all of these except your finger and the rubber tip so let's get on to the actual meet of this we're gonna we're gonna ignore the resistive ones and just go to the capacitive and digitizers so capacitive requires electricity to flow through whatever it's touching like your finger so finger or rubber tip and that means it's based on some sort of moisture content which is why rubber tips work and your finger works but a hard plastic stylus won't work capacitive screens are inexpensive and they rarely have batteries or buttons they're usually just like this they're just sort of a you know this is literally a pen with a rubber tip on the end capacitive touchscreens are really durable they're using a wide range of applications from point-of-sale systems to industrial controls you know because you get guys with dirty fingers and they you know they can't use the keyboard so they just have to touch the screen you'll also see them if you're at the mall if you're at the mall and you have a screen that you want to go over and and find you know where story is that's almost certainly a capacitive touchscreen the problem with it is there's no palm detection palm detection is the ability for the system to ignore the rest of your hand and just focus on the point and that is something that these capacitive screens are not usually very good at some are some are but not usually there are also not pressure sensitive so if you push a little bit you get a dog you push a lot you get the same dog on a bright note there's no buttons to get confused about and well rarely anyway and they really also have batteries if they do with their using bluetooth to actually talk to the screen or well talk to the device so what they're doing is they're you're touching and it knows where you're touching and then the buttons tell it what to do so I want to right click on I want to drag something whatever I want to erase something digitizers this is this is really where it's at today and the two laptops are going to show you today both have digitizers they are they have to gain vertical and horizontal lines in a grid they gain used Bluetooth to talk to the buttons on the devices and they are much more accurate they do have palm rejection so when I'm writing on the screen it'll ignore my hand or my palm or finger whatever and it will just pay attention to the stylus which is really great biggest problem with them is they're expensive you can spend between 50 to $200 on these things you spend more than that - and they can also be made to be locked down to a specific device so for instance the Apple pen only works on the Apple devices Apple wants it to which is kind of annoying okay so let's get to some of these demonstration we're not going to show resistive because we don't have any I'm not in my car but this as you can see is just a little rubber tip okay so I can go into here and I can draw and you can see if I touch the screen or I push really hard it doesn't really make any difference so to be clear virtually all screens with digitizers are also capacitive which means the more expensive screens like these Dell laptops have support for both the your fingertip and for the rubber tip which is great so what you'll notice let's just show you it doesn't have pressure control when I put a dot on here it just gives me a dot and I can push as hard as I want it doesn't make any difference he doesn't have pressure control pressure sensitivity but it does sup and it doesn't a palm detection you can see it's skipping here and that's a bit of a mess so let's get rid of this stylus and let's go on to this unit this is so let's show you the ones we've got here we have a Dell 5 7 9 X we have a del P and 5 7 7 w we have the P + 5 v 6w and we have a generic one now this is this hopefully will work it doesn't say it well specifically but it is an active stylus and it says it will work on most of these devices including a dell inspiron so this is a Dell Latitude so close enough they're almost the same so let's set these up and we'll go from there so what I'm gonna do is I'm not gonna bore you what I'm gonna do is I'm going to unbox them and I'm going to put the batteries in and then I'm going to add them to bluetooth so let's do that right now now if you've got one of these Dell pens you'll see that the most of them if not all of them and with these small little batteries as well as a large well large triple-a battery and you may wonder how to get into it well what you have to do is take the take the stylus and untwist from the spring and you'll see that there's this little connector in here that your little slot in here that you can put the batteries if you read the manual they say they the heads go down so square end up round end down let's plug this in screw back in the heads on these go in so the positive end goes down negative goes up in so I'm going to start with this generic one we're going to go over a couple of things the first before you get started the first is most of these will come well many of these will come with alternate nibs so alternate tips will also usually come with a little remover so you can change that my experience has been that unless you're an artist you don't care but basically just put the may have been there and you pull it and then you can put the other nibs in for some reason these Dells didn't come with it but this more expensive Dell did okay so I have these four or five stylus is ready to go and I want to show you why you really need to check the compatibility list before you buy these so basically as I mentioned in the explanation various devices various active stylus is using very similar technology just don't work on active the screen so you really got to make sure that it fits so let's go through this so I'm gonna go with your and I'll do set up bluetooth I'm going to set it up with the this is the Microsoft stylus first and it's gonna sit there just trust me it isn't gonna work okay this one isn't going to work either no this is on adele 5300 this is the pn 5 7 7 w and i can hold that the way you do that in this case is you hold the a race at the end there you press the button at the end won't say it just trust me we won't do it and the most frustrating of all this knockoff pen that's really enough knockoff it's just a generic one which has some pretty awesome well it's very very expensive and it feels nice and it it looks good for sports pressure sensitivity has three different nibs I mean you know it's a nice device it just that can get it sink either so if I know what you're supposed to do this is press and hold the up the well the upper portion of the button on the side for three to five seconds and it's supposed to sink just trust me it's not going to the only one that will sink with this is the one that says it's supported which is the five five six double you know that is from Dell and I've already well let's pair it so I'm just going to press this now press the button at the end there it is and connecting and we're done so let's go into a net and you can see here well maybe you can't see but the you know the stylus is working from from above the screen if I touch the physically touch the screen it will draw you can't see it but just trust me it's got pressure sensitivity on there the buttons are programmable so I can to pen settings here and I can set what I want to have happen when I double click I can in this case it'll launch snip and sketch I can have it launch other things as well I can program although the buttons here again this is just all through Windows you don't need to add any additional software so it'll even convert your handwriting to text if you want so you think well that's just Dell let's let's try something else lovely Microsoft Surface and I can tell you it's the same so when I go into settings I compare the stylus that came with it but none of the Dells work and none of the well I've tried several mock-ups they don't work either well she didn't call them knock-offs you think okay well maybe the Dells just work with the Dells Note see here we have Adele 5490 let's give that a shot so I'm gonna go to add device and I can tell you that these aren't going to work and I can tell you that the Microsoft Surface pen is not going to work let's try the one that just worked on the 5300 hmm there it is isn't that nice connecting so that's happy let's try this next Dell this is the Dell p m5 v 7w see if it works nope and same thing with the knockoff pen that's because they're not on the supported list so again what shouldn't call it a knockoff that there it is just isn't there so if your pen isn't on the supported list you can buy it but you're probably just going to get frustrated so that's that if you have any questions or concerns please get a hold of us www our tech dossier thank you for buying", "9pejvetFu3Y": "it's no secret that the best stylist out that you can currently get is definitely going to be the Apple pencil however it only works really with the iPad pro and it cost eighty nine pounds so today what we're going to be taking a look at is a budget option that I think is really awesome in the way that it works the functionality and also more importantly the price point so let's take a look and the products that we're taking a look at today is the Miko two-in-one Universal capacitive stylus now yes the name might be a little bit long but keep in mind that the price point at the moment for this is around twelve pounds here in the UK or around twelve dollars in the US and for that twelve pounds you don't just get one stylus you actually get two now you also have some interchangeable tips as well and you've got a ton of spares as you can see here you've got the clear disk tips for that more precision in terms of your stylus and you've got some fabric tips as well so you've got four of each giving you a ton of the still see and also a lot of spares if you need to change one or if you lose one and whereas the Apple pencil is made pretty much all of plastic the Miko two and one has a really nice metal and rubber finish to it there's actually really weighty to hold in the hand the interchangeable tips are really easy to change they just unscrew as you can see here so again really easy to change the tip if you need to know that you do have two styluses in the box you really only need one because as you can see here all you need to do is take the lid off one end put it on the other side and then you've got the additional tip there as you can see with the queer disc and then you've got the fabric pad just underneath and being a universal stylus this is gonna work on pretty much any device that has a capacitive touch screen so whether that's an Android phone as you can see here of my le phone you pro or something more substantial like the iPad or iPad pro or in my case the really awesome original iPad Mini now for me the larger fabric tip of the Mikko is really just for navigation at round a device as you can see here is extremely responsive and I'm not gonna lie it's kind of fun to use a stylus on a handheld device it can takes you back to the days of actually writing down notes or using a stylus on an older device for example when people didn't really know that touchscreens were going to exist also with a lot of newer devices being glass on glass on glass then it's really good to alleviate any fingerprints by using a stylus your device looks clean all of the time now you can still use the fabric tip for drawing and sketching but that's really where the clear disk tip comes in as it gives you a little bit more precision you've got like clear disks that you can see through onto the screen so it's a little bit more precise and where that will really been the only ones in the tablet market these days the App Store has a ton and I mean a ton of different drawing applications that can take advantage of something like this stylus or the Apple pencil now don't get me wrong this isn't going to give you all of the features of the Apple pencil and sometimes it doesn't work but as you can see here it works perfectly fine once it does now the reason for not working to be honest I think is the iPad itself I've tried on a ton of other touchscreen devices and it works perfectly fine so I wouldn't really worry about it not necessarily being responsive now I don't film in any crazy high frame rates here on YouTube so if I do try to slow down my footage this is what its gonna look like but it still gives you a good indication of actually how responsive the stylus is on the touchscreen now it's not going to give you the pressure sensitivity you're going to get with the Apple pencil or any of these tilting options but it's still really good for doing some sketches and also jotting down notes and once you've got enough skill you can create some really awesome pieces of our work like I've done here and it's not a picture I actually okay I didn't do it myself but this is just an example of exactly what you can do with a stylus on a touchscreen device and that's going to do it guys for this video now I'm gonna have the amico starters linked in the description down below if you want to pick one up for yourselves and if you did enjoy this video be sure to give it a thumbs up down below if you've got any questions or comments let me know in the comment section or on twitter at copper vs. grass if you're not already now is a great time to subscribe and once you've done that hit that notification bell so that you're notified any time that I post a new video here on the channel I'm Michael from copper vs. glass thanks for watching and I will catch you guys in the next video", "0aD8PEncFHU": "hi everyone this is teal from Park Blocks calm today I'm going to talk about capacitive and activist Alice's from their perspective of an artist and hopefully after you left watch this video you will realize how difficult it is to find perfect stylus or your tablet alright so when it comes down to the different types of dollars down January to type active and positive when you're buying a tablet or drawing purposes of a use Edward digital sketch pad you should know the differences between active and capacitive cultures because there are some differences that really affect the joint performance and today I'm going to talk about the different features the pros and cons of each type of scholars I am going to cover a lot of information in this video if you want to save time or you find that this is getting a bit confusing I recommend you check out the article that I've written on my blog it's easier to read and digest the link is in the video description below so how does the capacity scholars work it comes down to the screen expensive screen has an electro static field and when you tap on the screen with your finger it will distort the feel and the processor sensor will try to figure out where that distortion happens so they will know where you are tapping on the screen and one condition for this to work is the tip has to be wide enough to generate capacitance so a finger is wide enough to do that and that is why rubber starters work for starters with the fine tip they usually do not work well with that active screen so what about an active scholars and active stallers it works with digitizer screen digitizer is a special sensor or technology that is built into the touchscreen so that it can actively stand for the presence of a compatible solid by default almost all touch screens are a form of capacitive screen that's why they can work with your finger but not all screens are equipped with a digitizer so this is an active pen and when you move the ethics and close to the tablet the tablet will sense that the stylus is nearby and it will show you a cursor beneath the chip so this is a key feature of active sources and active pen and the digitizer technology provides additional features that are just not possible with capacitive stylus for example when active stylus is near the screen you get to see the cursor this is the Oval mode and with the cursor near the screen you can actually right click on a fault if there are buttons on the side of the stallers you can right-click on the cell and bring up the contextual menu or for some sources you can actually click the stylus around and you have the eraser mode so there are many different features some of which I'm going to talk about later on these are some of the capacitive sensors that I have I have already revealed all of them the links to the individual reviews will be in the video description below I just want to talk about the general pros and cons of this salsa's now the main advantage is they work with all sorts of touchscreen so they are just like a finger you can use them on any touchscreen I think the move common one would be solid with the rubber tip so this for example is the scholars with the rubber tip sometimes you may see salsas with the brush tip as well same thing they also distort the feel the electrostatic view on the tablet so that's why they work now those rubber tips like this they are not very accurate because the tip can be quite big and when you're drawing something like this it blocks the line of vision or the strips that are coming up beneath the chip so over the years there's this company called the doughnut you came out with this solid with a disk in fun now remember earlier I said that you need a big surface area for the tips in order for it to work so this tip here it's rather small but they have this disk so this disk is large enough to distort the electrostatic field on the tablet surface in order to create a line and it transparency allows you to be true to the lines that are drawn beneath so this is a rather smart design capacity sources like this are generally quite affordable for other dollar tips you can get them under US $10 for this doughnut dot true it's under $20 and some of these are brushes they are bit pricey but not as expensive compared to digital services or active sources trusted sources like this they do not have a lot of features you would just use them like you would use your finger and that's about it however there are some passages houses that are digital and they will communicate with your tablet to provide additional features for example this is a digital capacitive stylus if it has a big rubber tip and relative added fat as well this is called pencil that is made by this company called 53 and it's made specifically for this app called paper by teaching this is powered by an internal battery and this actually provides additional features TDS dollars you can pair these dollars we've got habit through YouTube connection and for example we're not drawing like this with the picture turned down you can get a watch group and when you're drawing like this you can get a very nice group and when you're kind of solid behind you can get the reason so all these are made possible because of the digital technology that give insight if you are going to be using a stores like this there is no way for your tablet to know when you're slipping to the other side or at what angle you are drawing with solid so what are some disadvantages of capacitive Salters like this as mentioned earlier the big rubber tip that blocks the line of vision the other thing is there is no palm rejection so when you are drawing something like this for example and you put a pump down on the screen there is going to be straight strokes because the tablet doesn't know that that is a pump because it's capacitive this is a finger this is $1.00 it has no way of differentiating between the finger and the scholars that's why when you put a pump like this and when you are drawing if you're not careful can see this sonic careful you will create straight strokes and this is very irritating especially for people who take notes who draw when you're doing something like this when you lift your head and then like that heat there are space trucks over there it could damage or destroy the work that you've done so no palm rejection is Nixon downside for artists now the other thing is there is no pressure sensitivity with houses like this you may see that there are some variations and troops but actually this is because of the South s slide by the software it's not because of this brother chip in recent years there are some new digital capacitive stylus I am referring to positive with quote marks because I do not actually know the actual technology used in sites but they perform exactly like the past eight scholars that means when you tap on the screen to draw they do give you lines but there is no palm rejection there is no prejudice sensitivities now the downside to such causes is there can be some misalignment problems depending on the angle that you are holding the sellers and the orientation of the tablet whether it is in vertical format or horizontal format that is going to affect the misalignment so let me try and draw our vertical stroke I'm not able to draw anything because my promise on the screen there is no palm rejection so as long as my palm is on the screen I cannot draw anything so I have to lift up my arm prevent it from touching the screen so that's quite irritating when there is no palm rejection now that I lift off my hand and try and draw a vertical stroke check out where the line is coming out from it's coming out from the right side of the tip so that's the misalignment problem that I'm talking about if you draw with the stolid vertically then it's not so much of the problems that you really depends on whether you're comfortable on what point vertically like that all the time so I have one straight stroke because of the lack of time objection let me turn this into a vertical format and show you the misalignment problem again now I'm writing in my normal head writing position notice how the line to come out directly beneath the tip now I'm actually holding the stylus at an angle not vertically this is vertically and this is at an angle and it's accurate at angle so when this particular tablet is in vertical format I'm able to get accurate lines that's no misalignment issue that when I choose this horizontally I get me to London problem that is specific to this particular tablet if you are using some other tablet or some other phone it's going to behave differently so you have to try it out and most of the times you are not able to try out because you don't have to sell it on hand to try out so it's like tea and meals with a misalignment but usually usually I've tried on many tablets I've tried many sources it will either work in one mode divided work is vertical format or horizontal format but not both format that's when it comes down to the misalignment issues one significant downside of digital services and by digital and referring to active scholars as well as digital capacity spouses so the downside is when drawing diagonal lines absolutely there is this jitter effect so it's almost impossible to draw a perfectly straight line only thing that is because of my trembling hand so I'm going to use a ruler and draw the same line again so it's the same thing so this happens only for diagonal lines for vertical or horizontal lines it's doesn't seem to affect them so this can be quite irritating if you need that level of accuracy earlier on I mentioned that capacitive salsas they do not support regular sensitivity however digital capacitive salsas some of them did you support pressure sensitivity for example I'm using one right now and if I press down hot I can get sick lines I can get thin lines and click one so there is some sort of technology inside these capacitive dollars that communicates with the tablet to unlock that that pressures and I'm applying all right enough with capacitive salsas let's move on to active sauces now the benefit the advantage of having an active scholars is they are more accurate because when you're in horrible there is this little cursor believe it that will tell you where your line is going to come out long so just it's very accurate there's not going to be any misalignment issues at all so you can hold your pen in whatever and go or what a position that you like most active sources they support pressure sensitivity now this is a feature that is sought after about artists the digitizer screen is able to register the pressure that you apply on the screen and create the lines with appropriate thickness because there is the whole world mode when you see the cursor you can put your palm on the screen and you have perfect calm rejection so that is great for taking note and drawing with digital capacitive sources sometimes they say that there is a four-pound rejection but so far I have not found any that support perfect palm rejection or active spouses they have perfect public action as long as you see the cursor the screen will know that there is a spellers there and you will block out all your finger oil palm or touches basically the main advantage of having an active scholars is the accuracy that it can provide so it's very accurate it has palm rejection it has pressure sensitivity so when you're drawing the lines will come up exactly where you want them to and you will come out in a Cell that you want and now let's talk about the downside this is a digital taller so it has some problem with diagonal lines as well there is still the jitter layer the only digital sources that I know that do not have the jitter problem or where the jitter is not very significant will be the Apple pencil the doughnut pixel this is for high faculty and welcome scholars for the are mobiles in kicks another downside of active sources is the price this is a digital seller so it is more expensive compared to those rubber tip sources however this is not as expensive compared to the Apple pencil which is you have $100 or even the doughnut pixel or iPad which is us $80 the last thing I want to talk about is the support for features on digital sources now whether all the features are supported it depends on the app and the OS that's important for example if you want to customize the button on this dollars and there is no driver for you to do so you will not be able to customize the buttons obviously you may be surprised that I mean you have a solid button there should be a driver provided but that is not always the case and also these dollars may have pressure sensitivity but how well it actually works it will come down to the app support how good that applicants are all rather or you can adjust the pressure sensitivity curve whether you can make this more than this more sensitive or less as it is again the driver may or may not be provided with the tablet that you have one important thing to note about these active sources is they are usually designed to work with devices are made for for example this is a renewable active pen it can only will reverse the specific removal tablets and with the Microsoft's of this hand you can only support Microsoft Surface product if you happen to have a Samsung Tab 8 you may notice that there are two different models of Samsung's happy there the first model is called Samsung 50 the other model is called some songs have a with f10 so if you have bought Samsung tap a without the S Pen and you decide to buy the S Pen later on that S Pen will not be able to work on your device because your device does not come with a digitizer screen so even though they are both columns on cafes the technology is slightly different in your screen I know I cover a lot of information and it might be a bit difficult to absorb so I do recommend you check out the text review that I've written the link is in the video description below before the final which is the best dollars for the tablet that you are using check out the link below so that's all for today's video if you have any questions feel free to put them in the comment section below I will try to answer them thanks for watching see you in the next video bye you", "apoKdu-awFQ": "hi everyone this is Jill from pakka blocks calm today I'm reviewing the Adonit jot Pro fine point stylus and I'll be reviewing this from the perspective of an artist it uses these to draw so let's get right into the ravine and see how it performs this is the stallers meet by a doughnut a doughnut also makes a lot of artists Alice's as well this particular one is called the jot Pro fine point and the construction build quality for this is excellent it's metal throughout comes with a pen cap that you can screw on inside you have the tip with this transparent plastic disc and I'll talk about the disc later on when drawing and pen cap is very useful for protecting the plastic disc because once I drop this pen onto the floor and disc detached from the tip and I spent the next five minutes trying to find where the plastic this is because it's transparent and it's difficult to see again stick around so that's the kapu after plastic disc from disappearing so always remember to cap the pan when you finish using there's this little rubber ring here at the bottom not sure if you can see so when you screw it back on it will dampen the the cap a bit before you actually can screw it totally I think that's a very good design touch there it's very nice then we have the grip there's some more texture here which makes holding a bit I think better but overall the stylus is a matte body comes in black mushroom there are other colors but I bought one in black color then as these panic click behind and when you uncap your cap and screw your cap you can put it at it back one thing to note is you should try to screw this tightly on the back because it does come loose be easily so I always try to screw it as tight as possible on the back so that it doesn't get lost so oops drop on the ground ok let's see how it does how the stellas perform when it's drawing I usually draw with this stylus on the iPad but you can use it on any tablet or phones because there's no electronic component in sight it functions more like dumb stylus or like a finger you can use it on any tablet and in brands of tablet phones there drawing app that I'm using is the Wacom Bamboo you can use these stylus on any drawing app so it's not hep specific so let me show you the some of the strokes that you can do using the pen 2 in this app so what the nice thing about this particular disc here is that you can see true to the lines that you draw so you get a more accurate drawing let me show you just by drawing a few ships I'll try to con complete lines so I'll draw a vertical stroke and then because the tip is transparent I get to basically connect the dots together my palm was touching them so this stylus is not does not have any I will say electronic our communication device that will communicate your tablet so if you were to put your palm on it and draw it bill you will not draw so you have to leave your pump off while you're drawing so you can see this tree dot here let's meet by my palm so I always have to lift it up when when I'm drawing me draw a few shapes it's pretty cool the rice exceptionally smooth on the screen I don't think that this is going to scratch the iPad screen in any way and its really very smooth and it's a pleasure to actually draw of this dollars let me use the brush too same thing there's no lag whatsoever it's almost like drawing with your finger except it's more natural because you are now drawing with a pen like to draw a car you see that the strokes come up immediately there's no lag whatsoever and it's pretty accurate as I say the points the lines go exactly where you want them to there's no pressure sensitive to this particular stylus but a doughnut they actually sell version of this stylus with the pressure sensitive this pressure sensitivity but that one is press this battery power and it's more expensive this one costs about US dollar $30 that's three zero $30 so we can do a lot of nice catcher's on it it's really very smooth I mean try one maybe after all myself so that's why I like this dollars for drawing it's very smooth and performs very well and you can use these dollars on any applications as well using Wacom Bamboo paper so you can use it on maybe procreate or even just the paper by 53 so this one is paper is it 53 I think by I think this is how they spell their company's name we go back to show you how the pen writes is very good for writing as well so I'm going to choose a pen - okay my captive ruled off so remember always to cap it right so sometimes I use these dollars to take notes as well this is the shot bra fine point and by the way the tip has some sort of a dampening effect so it does actually move a bit backwards I think is a nice design touch again so this pan cause about u.s. dollar to T dollars and it writes quite well as well very good sometimes I like to do some here's some funny sketches Sita is very nice for doodling and stuff like that and I think that's all for the reveal it's a very good stylist I like it because you can use it on any tablet on any drawing application and it performs very well it performs very predictably unlike some electronic stylus where the stylus depends on the drawing app this one you can use it on any drawing app and it performs as well on one app to the other app so if you want to buy a stylus I will say keep an eye out board is more watch shop look for this one doughnut thank you for watching and this is a very good stylus that I really like so if you have any questions just feel free to post them in the comment section below I also post some links to drawings that I drew with the stylus as well remember to subscribe to the YouTube channel because I'll be posting more after that reviews and sketching videos in the future thank you for watching have a nice day", "YWi7zoM-aKE": "hi there in today's video I'm going to be comparing the Apple pencil first-generation to a generic digital stylus before we get into this if you decide that you enjoy my content and want to see more please click that red subscribe button down below along with a little belt icon so that YouTube will hopefully notify you every time I upload a new video maybe you've been wanting to get into digital art because of all of the amazing inspiration plastered all over Instagram and Twitter but maybe you can't afford an iPad pro in an Apple pencil like everyone seems to be using nowadays if so keep watching and hopefully you'll be able to find some alternative solutions with this information that I've gained from my own experience all products mentioned will be linked in the description if you're interested in any of them I'm not affiliated or sponsored by anyone and where I ended up purchasing my iPad pro and Apple pencil I will talk more about at the end of the video plus I'll make some digital art for the first time so stick around if you're interested in that so up until recently my devices were an iPad Mini 4 and an iPhone 5s I know they're super old models but in all honesty I've had both for several years now and they are both still basically in perfect condition my iPhone charges faster than any device I've ever owned and I had no intention on getting a newer iPad because of how well my Mini 4 works and the fact that I was able to purchase and download procreate on it was a big plus you may be wondering about this monster here but we'll get to him later there is also procreate pocket for those who don't know it's a mobile version of the app procreate as 10 US dollars and pocket is 5 the original stylus I've been using for things like editing thumbnails is this one it's from the brand mix ooh on Amazon it was like 12 or 13 dollars it has a rounded fiber tip on this end and it's a pretty nice smooth metal feel and has a pretty good weight to it it doesn't feel cheap at all has a rubber grippy on it and the cap just unscrews the cap is super important because this pin has a disk nib which seems pretty fragile it's flexible it does come with two replacement disk nibs in case you need them the instructions tell you not to remove it the pen will not work without the disk and it works pretty well for what I was using it for but when it came to drawing it was a little difficult to know where exactly the point was when I'd place it down the screen and that was a little annoying so I decided to upgrade and went back onto Amazon unfortunately come to find out that Apple pencils are very expensive even the first generation but I was greeted with a whole slew of unbranded digital styluses that all promised great things as a comparison to the Apple pencil at half the price unfortunately again most of them are only compatible with iPad minis fifth generation and up mine's a four so the search continued and eventually I did find one that was compatible with my device yeah so here it is it was $30 and since it didn't feature palm rejection like all the other ones did I also purchased some palm rejection gloves either I didn't read the description well enough or something because the stylus actually ended up coming with a glove no matter the one it came with was actually a bit loose on my hand I have no idea what size it is which isn't a huge deal I guess I just felt like I had to keep pulling it up and the ones that I purchased they came in a pack of two for like eight dollars were a size small and they were nice and snug some glove listings have a slide that shows which hand measurements fit which size of gloves so that was really helpful so after playing around with this stylus for a while here are some of the pros that I found also remember that I'm using it on an iPad Mini 4 and though this model has been discontinued for sale from Apple it still gets all the new updates but obviously it doesn't have the same processing power as newer models also it does work on my iPhone but this review is focused on the iPad so basically you just start by clicking this button the on and off button it doesn't take any Bluetooth connection or set up you just turn it on and it automatically works on the screen it came with a USB charging cable and I plugged it in immediately when I got it and it showed being fully charged after like a few hours of course it did have a bit of charge when it arrived and the cap is also magnetic so you just pull it off to insert the cable and then obviously this side goes to your power source right now I have on the rounded fiber nib on the back but it also comes with an interchangeable end cap that's just it just it's nothing it's just a cap I'm not sure why you wouldn't need this maybe just for looks I don't know it seems kind of useless to me so I just keep this fiber one on because this one also works on the screen and the regular cap it doesn't it has a pretty nice hand feel and a decent weight the 13 dollar one is actually heavier even though it's shorter I mean it's not bad it doesn't feel cheap it still feels like a nice quality and it's magnetic so it can somewhat hold your iPad [Music] [Applause] [Music] the biggest Pro I feel like this stylist has over the Apple pencil is just the fact that it does work on older models of iPads so if you have an older model of iPad like I do and you can't afford to upgrade this is a great cheaper alternative to still be able to create digital art or you know do whatever else you'd need to do with a digital stylus like take notes or whatever before I start the con list I want to remind you that a lot of these cons stem from me just not having a compatible device but if you have an iPad Mini 5 or newer iPad 6 generation iPad air third generation or the iPad pro 11 or 12 point 9 inch then some of these cons might not apply so for the cons just kidding I don't want to dissuade anyone from buying one of these if it is all you can afford and you really want to get into digital art just find what works for you so it was decently responsive at first I started noticing that certain things wouldn't work right unless you held it and a straight up-and-down angle like changing the size or opacity of my brush you can see I'm holding it at a pretty natural angle to hold a pencil I feel like and it seems like the nib would be touching the like the size changing bar here but it's marking but if it's straight up and down it works fine I wasn't sure at first if this was the fault of the pen or the iPad but I did notice that when I'd used my finger instead it worked fine also flipping the pen around and using the fiber network fine even from an angle obviously a stated before it doesn't have palm rejection so you kind of need the glove unless you're really good at not letting your hand rest on the screen while you draw I tried out both the glove that came with the stylus and the ones I purchased separately and they both worked pretty decent but there were a few times I think my hand was detected and it caused a mark where I didn't want it it's working pretty good right now though trying to make a liar out of me I see there are multiple settings that you can customize that don't work with the generic stylus only the Apple pencil for example I'll make a mark here so I've got it set so that whenever I'm touching the square icon the pin will smudge if I take my finger off obviously it will draw and if you go up here to your settings and your gesture controls so if I were to change it to this one where a finger will always smudge it doesn't differentiate between a generic stylus and your finger to the iPad they're the same this is a feature that is exclusive to the Apple pencil so the nib on this stylus is flat so you don't get the feel of a traditional pencil with a point the Apple pencil has that pointed tip so it's much more of a realistic drawing feel with this knit being flat if you have the pen tilted too far at an angle sometimes it doesn't register your marks whereas with the Apple pencil just like with a real pencil if you're using it directly on the tip it'll create a hard line but if you tilt it on its side it can create a smoother shading effect / larger surface area mark you can't get that with this flat nib there are some digital styluses that have a fine tip fiber nib but once again not compatible with my device this one could probably not be considered a con if you were able to get used to it but I noticed that whenever I would try to connect to lines okay what is happening I still have it set to smudge okay so if I try to connect to lines it doesn't mark right where I feel like I've put the nib the calibration is just a bit off even though I feel like I'm pretty close and you could see how this would be very annoying having to constantly go back and under your work at the fault of the pin there we go there's one and that's by holding the pen straight up and down then I can get it right on there but a lot of people don't draw like that I certainly don't draw like that and you can't calibrate it yourself because it isn't connected to the device in any way so it just depends on how much you're willing to pay for and settle for and get used to I did end up getting an iPad pro which I will talk more about in a minute but still using the same generic stylus I was having the same line connecting problem as on the Mini 4 [Music] not sure what happened there deleted itself I'm not sure what's happening I've got my entire hand resting on the screen but it's completely protected by this glove so surely it's not detecting my hand through the glove when the line is thicker it's less noticeable so this is straight up and down and then at a more natural angle once again this might just be user error or something that you can get used to but we're gonna do the same test with the Apple pencil to see how it compares well I can't do it on this one because it won't work but we will do it on the pro so this seems like a pretty consistent issue on both devices so whenever I try to draw anything slowly the line would be wavy like noticeably the slower I go the worse it is I don't know about you but when I'm working on certain details I have to go slow to get it exactly the way I want it if I draw a line fast it's much smoother but that's just not practical for me and the way I draw and that'd be nice there is a setting you can adjust when you choose your brush called streamline if you raise it up it will somewhat smooth out the line but it will also predict where your mark is going to go so if I raise it up all the way you can see when I draw a circle it doesn't draw exactly where my pen is marked it tries to predict or I want the line to be so raising streamline does somewhat smooth the lines but if you raise it too high it can mess with your precision so just keep that in mind now I'm doing the same slow line drawing test on the iPad Pro and I started with the streamline all the way down and as you can see it's much smoother than on the Mini 4 there's still a tiny bit of wave but it's much less noticeable and drawing so slowly that I feel like any bumps are just my unsteadiness so raising the streamlines setting still activate predictive drawing but it's not necessary to get smooth lines when drawing slow Oh in a smaller con but I still feel like it's a con the digital stylus is too large to fit into this iPad pro case unless you take the cap off but there's a place to put that too so do with that what you will obviously this case was made to hold the Apple pencil so but still probably the biggest con and the reason that I did opt to get an Apple pencil in the end is that the generic stylus doesn't have pressure sensitivity and what I mean by that is when you're drawing traditionally if you press light the mark is light and thin you know depending on what medium you're using obviously in the nib but if you press harder the mark gets darker and thicker with a generic stylus it makes the same mark no matter the pressure you use there's no sensitivity unlike the Apple pencil which we will look at next even though I was limited to this stylus because it was one of the only ones that was compatible with my Mini 4 I didn't see any other generic styluses for newer models that featured pressure sensitivity I believe that is exclusive to the Apple pencil and now for the real star of the show this is the Apple pencil first-generation and I'll be demonstrating with it on the iPad pro since it doesn't work on my other devices so the first thing that I noticed is that they both look and feel pretty much the same I can barely tell but it does feel like the Apple pencil is a hair heavier maybe two hairs you can see that the digital stylus is a bit longer and obviously the Apple pencil does fit in this slot with its cap on so there's no on/off button you just you connect it through bluetooth by plugging it into your iPad where it can also be charged if you buy them new they come with female-to-female connector so that you can charge it with an apple cable but since I bought mine used I can still buy one separately if I want to but you don't really that though as long as your iPads charged you can just use it to charge the pencil which is awesome so once it's connected through bluetooth it stays connected even when your Bluetooth is off so Google says that when the iPad is asleep so is the pencil so there's that the pressure sensitivity is apparent right away barely touching it to the screen makes a very light mark and pressing harder makes it darker even at this extreme angle the pen still works in the size changer like you don't even really have to try unlike the other one where it had to be straight up and down to really work for the slow line test I'm starting with the stream line all the way down and there is a tiny bit of wave not near as noticeable as the first pen though now let's raise the stream line up to 10% the waves are happening much slower and I'll hardly put any pressure so you can see how light the line is I press down harder so obviously quick lines will be nice and smooth [Music] circles nice and smooth let's turn the streamline all the way up to the max that's pretty great there is the tiniest bit of wave but it's night and day compared to the other stylists with the circle test it's still predicting where I'm gonna draw so you do have to bring it out and around to get it right but if you draw a circle and don't pick your pen up it'll create a perfect circle anyway so yeah this is what I meant earlier by using the side of the pencil you get a shading type of effect one thing I will say that I was surprised and even a little annoyed by was that when using the eraser tool even if the opacity is all the way up you have to press fairly hard to get it to erase completely unless you just lightly erase continuously until it's gone unlike the digital stylus where since there's no sensitivity you don't have to press hard to erase maybe this is something that you can adjust in a setting somewhere that I'm just not familiar with yet but I found it kind of strange now I'm gonna do the same drawing with each stylus the first one is done with the generic stylus and I'm putting the screen cap on with each respective drawing so that you can get a better view of what's going on and the Apple pencil drawing will be after this one so I ended up purchasing the Apple iPad pro nine point seven inch it's a first generation on eBay refurbished from manufacturer the storage capacity is 32 gigs and it was $225 I was able to choose my storage capacity color and the condition it was in if you're not familiar with eBay depending on what options you choose it changes how much you pay for it and there our seller refurbished devices for better prices but they usually have like cracks on the glass but not the screen or be slightly bent or like the sound doesn't work or have like a line on the LCD which I read can actually affect the like precision of a stylus or pencil so I opted for something a little bit higher price and better quality this one I chose was an excellent condition and it was said to have some possible minor scratches on the surface or exterior but still be in perfect working condition and there is one or two tiny hairlike scratches on the screen but they're only noticeable if the screen is off and you hold it at an angle in the light and I have a tempered glass screen protector on it so it doesn't affect my pencil the Apple pencil I purchased was also from eBay and I got it used for fifty five dollars in five dollars shipping new they run about $80 on ebay and 95 on Amazon and so far mine works great and I'm really happy with my purchase what I was really happy about was that I initially purchased procreate on my Mini 4 but I was able to redownload it for free on my iPad Pro through my iCloud account [Music] [Applause] [Music] so here's something I wasn't anticipating when drawing the eyelashes with a generic stylus the brush I was using would be thick at first and then it would taper nicely like an eyelash would but using that same brush with the Apple pencil it's actually up to me to control the pressure to make that same effect which is not easy it took a lot more effort and messing around with settings to finally get it figured out and I'm pretty sure I've already forgotten how to do it by now but I'm sure it's something that I'll get used to it just surprised me that there would be something made easier by using the cheaper product let me know in the comments whether you prefer traditional or digital art or maybe if you do them interchangeably if you were thinking about going digital I hope this video helped in some way as far as you know talking about the different ways that styluses can be used on different devices I will still definitely be doing traditional I love watercolor and pencils and I just got me some arches watercolor paper background so stay tuned to my channel for some digital art videos along with traditional art ok thanks guys bye [Music]", "v2W1GQjS92k": "hello guys if you're following this channel for a long time you know that the one thing I miss the most from my note 4 is the s-pen I've recently got this iPad Mini 4 and I wanted to use something like this all the styles available are very very thick pointer so they're not really doing the job and I decided to go for this one active styles pen I'm going to link it in the description so let's try and connect it and see if it works as it's supposed to be and let's zoom using this little box here so I have this little twin once timespan two-in-one active style pen instruction it's suitable for most capacitive touchscreen devices and so on so on so on so I have the microUSB port for charging the power button and to have something on the language I don't understand here and something on the language I do understand so that's the model is the built in battery and all the information that you probably don't need to know right now so this goes away ok little cap here which doesn't look great the inside as you can see it looks like someone already used it but anyway we have the pen pretty solid doesn't feel cheap and what bothers me slightly is that the tip of the pointer is made of metal so if you don't have screen protector on your phone these might cause some problems so where is this thing going them no let's just try and open and see what's happening here so there's the microwaves before charging or I guess you can just switch the different apps I don't know why this sound listen cool this one looks like a microphone top I definitely wouldn't use this finger on any of my screens good what else do we have I have a little bow back hide it in with significant effort oh it's on not yet we have the charging cable and that's it empty box okay so let's see how to connect it should be fully charged yeah okay press the power button to start up the pen blue LED signal signals the working status of the pen no Bluetooth or any app connections required hmm so how's it going to connect to the device then let's see so I press the button is it on yes it is oh wow okay yeah no connection then why is it called Bluetooth or whatever it was cold I was just called active okay that's pretty cool can I have a note or a reminder yes in the draw I don't know let's add a reminder I think I need to install and I'm not going to bother you with this handwriting recognition you have some notes here add a note and there we go let's see well that's fantastic that's actually pretty good nice I have no idea how this works but it does it works pretty good Wow so I just turned it on and that was it no connection required nothing pretty good I like it now read a little bit more about it and I'll let you know if there are any issues apart from but so far so good you just open it press the button and that's it and it find out what is this and why does it look like a microphone tab top but that will be fun you know what I think I have an idea and because my device has a screen protector on it I might actually risk it so do you think this is going to be like [Music] on a pencil write with one side and then you race with the other side no I think it's just like the old non active stylus is the Pacific top which you can just use to alright but again it looks like made of metal and I'm not sure I would use it on unprotected device but apart from that this product is amazing our link it in the description let me know if you have any questions and thanks for watching see in the next one bye bye", "R5r2mrPO4Cc": "are you looking for a decent stylist hey folks welcome back to tech couch for another video review and this is a review on the mecco styluses now these are they come in two packs they're relatively inexpensive I think these are like 17 bucks for a two pack of these guys come with multiple tips for replacements things like that but this is might be a really good option to look at especially even if you have an iPad pro and you don't want to spend the money on the Apple pencil now I'll show you here a little bit while this is still the better tool in all reality but for a hundred bucks versus 17 bucks for two of them it all comes down to how much you're actually gonna use it I to be honest about it don't use my Apple pencil very much I'm just not a stylus kind of guy I don't do a whole lot of hard stuff on my tablet but what I do use it I love this thing and I'm glad I bought it so this is definitely gonna be something maybe less tailored to the iPad pro audio iPad pro audience or if you have an older iPad or even just a standard iPhone that can't use the Apple pencil these might be something to look into so we're gonna first bring it in here we're gonna open this up and I'm gonna show you what comes with it and then we're gonna actually put it head-to-head with the amal pencil to show you why where the differences lie so as you can see here within the box second-generation high-sensitivity stylus is from Ecco they do give you a little pad to clean it with clean your screen off if you'd like to and then of course just the standard instructions on how to actually use it but this is style so they my case came with a black one in a rose gold one it does come with for replacement standard tips and then two of the traditional type tips which actually not rubber they're actually like a like a stainless steel or a mesh grade to them which is kind of different but this is the stylus in order to get to those tips everything is actually in here it's just all housed so it doesn't get damaged when you're not using it you for one side you unscrew it and flip it around then you have the more sensitive or the probably the more what I would say the more accurate pinpoint type styluses they have this little plastic disk on there so you actually lay it flat on the surface when you're writing this tends to be a lot more accurate than the traditional capacitive type stylus so when you don't with that on the screw push it back and now you're protected same with the other side the other side is actually just remove and go just has the cap that actually also is your your clip on it as well and then you have your standard finger type capacitive type stylus not like this is different because this is actually more like stainless steel mesh on it but it's more like using a sharpie a large sharpie and it actually even sounds like what you'll hear sure here in a minute when I actually demo this stuff so let's actually bring out the iPad let's get the video set up a different little different way and we'll show how they actually compare or how they work and then how they compare to the Apple pencil okay so we are using the app paper from this app we were actually to do our little testing so first all I'm gonna write is tech couch on YouTube and I'm gonna do it in three different ways first I'm gonna use the what I call the Sharpie pen standard finger stylus then I'm going to use the more pinpoint stylus and then we'll go to actually use the Apple pencil now these two are gonna be a little bit harder because I'm not gonna have that it's gonna treat the the actual styles just like my my hand or anything like that so but take my time best I can having a black we're gonna do a little more like a pencil and we'll go from there so I'm gonna fast forward through this but first this would then this would then that would right okay now the more fine points news okay there that last the Apple pencil so I could sit here and talked about which one looks the best which one looks more like my handwriting and it's pretty obvious that the Apple pencil definitely does oh but it's you up in here so you can see a little bit more what actually looks like so I'm not gonna say that one looks terrible because they're all legible at least in certain aspect my handwriting general is that great but um you could tell that I could actually get each with each Indus instance I could actually get smaller and to be honest I think I can actually write smaller with the Apple pencil even yet so that's this is the out pencil because I have an iPad this is gonna be the same thing if I was talking about a Galaxy Note or anything like that or Microsoft servers that has specifically specialized stylus that can work other their displays these the for the first two could work on any standard capacitive type display so there's no specific needed there's no battery in these it doesn't matter if it's an Apple iPad or if it's a Samsung phone or a tablet or a Microsoft Surface it doesn't matter but you can obviously tell with a specialized stylus we're getting a little bit more accurate I could write a lot smaller that I can't with this and of course like you saw about what I did the Apple pencil I can actually have my hand on the tablet if I do that with these and I'm gonna try to get this so you can actually see it I'm gonna spot that you can actually see it if I put my hand on here it doesn't register all the time so because I'm just gonna start writing I was gonna write ABCD efg alright with my hand on it so I didn't stop writing but you can see it missed a few letters and that's just because it doesn't know between the skin of my poem of the actual stylus tip itself or if I have a specialized type stylus it doesn't it could just keep going so that's what things did to keep them whatever you're writing with these you may have to keep your hand off of the actual thing I'm sure if you were like a glove or you put something down at you're fine but that's something to always keep by with a capacitive type stylus but not bad to be honest so so for what they are the mecha styluses are not a bad little option they they feel pretty good in the hand you know they feel like a standard a size pencil or paint or pen you do have to worry about that hand rejection it's not gonna work like it does with the Apple pencil because this isn't going off capacitive this is going off that sensitive layer which is not gonna pick up your fingerprints like like this does this relies off that that capacitive capability but it does work it does work really well specifically for larger type print I like that it has those dual options where you have two different types of tips I little I really like how it actually does pack up really easily so that you're not gonna damage it like now I can just throw this in my bag I'm not gonna worry about damaging it at all just toss it in there like you would with a normal pen pen or a pencil and go from there I do like that they give you two and there are different color combinations but Rose golden black you know maximize so that is the stylus from mecco so I will put a link at the top

the iPad pro 2018 so I send it back actually to Thomas on where it came from and then in a paperless movement Facebook group somebody told me oh it's working now for the new iPad pro 2018 since the iOS 12.2 update so I ordered it again and here it is and I tested it and it's working and it's even better than that it's actually really exciting how good this thing is [Music] hi everyone and welcome to the paperless movement youtube channel i'm tom solid and i research the best hardware and software solutions you need to digitize your life to become more productive at work and in your home office to have more time for the things that really matter to you and this here is something you should have a look at if you are using an ipad pro or any other ipads but first of all let's have a look what is actually in this little box here so that's the box let's make a very quick unboxing here so all your good hvenaer in this box is actually the cryin itself it's in this phone thing and the rest is you know Apple like very minimalistic nothing else and as you know just a simple instruction and there's no charging cable because it actually has a lightning connector there as well as you use for your iPhone or for the older iPads just so you aware that with the iPad pro 2018 which has USBC connector for charging no longer lightning connector which this one needs you won't be able to charge it because there's no charge in a package and before I start showing you some things on the iPad pro let's have a quick look in comparison with the epic pencil 2 and the epic pencil 1 so here they are we have two EpiPens little two we have the logo jet Kryon and we have the epic pencil one then you see already that the EpiPens one is a bit longer if you take off the cap so you see here there's the connector this is how it looks like so for the Apple pencil one of the Apple pencil tool you see the front the two tips are exactly the same where you can just take off the tip and exchange the tip once it's broken yeah well in the manual there's nothing mentioned that I could change the tip walls or anything so let's just have a look inside this one and also there are two little holes here on the side you don't really need to press anything in there well you can if you can't get it off properly but I realized for this one it is pretty pretty easy to take it off and what we see here now is that we actually have the same tip as we have in our other two pencils as well so what this means is that if your tip is worn out or you know you need to change it because it broke or something like that then you can just buy new tips as you would do for your HEPA pencil as well and you can just put it onto onto your Kryon as well see so I was using now or the one from the EPI pencil tool and it fits perfectly so it seems like it is it is st mentioned the same technology they use in EpiPens and if you look in the inside here i don't know if you can see it on the camera the front here looks exactly looks exactly the same as for the two other happy pencils so it seems it is really exactly the same tip as for the other tool every pencils here so here's the thing before we go even deeper in how it functions or something like that you see there is the same technology built into this crime from Logitech like it is for the other two epic pencils from Apple when it comes down to the tip the thing is that the Apple pencil 2 is still around $149 and you can get the log e check crying already for $69 also as it is working now for the iPad pro and for all the other iPads as well the normal iPad since the 6th generation the iPad Mini and all these you can use this logitech cryin on all these devices but Tom is it actually reworking as good as the Apple pencil too I mean there might be a reason that it is so expensive it is expensive because it's epic so you paying the name of that is behind this product and the design choices and everything and here you really have a great alternative and that it is actually the case I will show you now when I connect it to my iPad pro 2018 where I use the Apple pencil 2 only so here we are that's the iPad pro 2018 and all I have to do with my EpiPens list just put it on top it will connect directly with the magnet everybody knows is already it connects and it charges as well that's really an advantage however carrying around the case like this I wouldn't recommend so I made another videos about what case you should get in my opinion that actually covers this Apple pencil and here as well I'm eagerly waiting for the slim folio from Logitech check for me all the boxes a good case actually needs subscribe to this channel if you want to state you and want to see my review about this logitech smart case so let's make a new site here and I'll show you now with the epic pencil 2 here which is by made by Apple that we can just draw as you used to like this and it's it is really awesome so here you can see that the Apple pencil also have the shading and that's what I really love to feature with the shading and the first time I was using and happy pencil this just blew my mind how good this shading is how precise and the thing is that's really awesome and there is no latency that I can feel ok maybe there is latency but it is so fast now that and this is really fast and obviously you can use it in all the note-taking apps I'm recommending here on this channel as well it is really awesome however let's check out the crying now I will show you the reasons but you really should think twice before you buy the Apple pencil - of course now for the Logitech you need to charge it via a cable but in my opinion it's no problem at all and there's actually a little LED light here that starts showing you that battery goes empty so you have enough time to get to the charger and charge to cry on there is no indicator here on your Apple pencil at all so now let's just connect the Logitech and what you actually need to do see nothing works so you have a power button here just press and hold it for one second and the green light starts flashing and when this happened still nothing connected what you need to do is you need to go to the settings and disconnect the Apple pencil so therefore you need to go to this to the Bluetooth settings and just press here and forget this device and in asks for you so this also means that you only can use one pencil at a time now magic it's already connected I don't know how Olynyk does this then it is directly connected and it doesn't appear here in the bluetooth list so if anybody of you know how this technology works and it connects to the iPad Pro without any obvious connection please let me know in the comments below I am eager to know how this works and now I will use the cryin and procreate and try to draw about the same thing and you see there's no delay that it feels exactly the same as the Apple pencil really I'm not kidding and the thing is you also get the shading it works the same it works exactly the same you have two shading here that's unbelievable there's no latency there's no feeling of latency or anything this is awesome see how fluent Isis let's also go into a note-taking app like net note self still my favorite note-taking app and let's make it smaller right something it is awesome it works perfectly really so the only thing you have to consider is the shape it's the same length it's a it's the same weight it feels like the same weight but the shape is different so for the Logitech you will see it has about this shape if you use if you know have a look at the heavy pencil - it has something like this it's round here and you have a flat side and for the heavy pencil one it's round so that's the difference s in in the shape so you need to get used to the shape but actually I think it it feels very well you know these pencils where you make technical sketches and so on they look exactly the same and it is very well to hold so you might think okay why do they charge double the price so I told you already it's the name of every pencil however there's also another feature included in every pencil tool which is the double tape feature and this double tip allows you to switch between shapes here for example in no Chao you have an a double tip I don't know if you can see this it switches on it switches off you can change this a note sure if you can change it to different tools like the eraser and so on but I actually disable this feature why because while I'm writing for no reason it starts to switch here maybe I do some movement where I accidentally make a gesture that feels like a double tap for the Apple pencil I don't know and it will just change the tool and that's really annoying by your writing and especially if you have the eraser then it it starts raising instead of writing then you start double tapping again and I told you in another video already that I'm not really happy with this double tap yeah in my opinion I don't miss this double tap I don't need it and if this is the only thing that that you or you say oh I really need this double tap then go for the Apple pencil to the Apple pencil one doesn't have this double tap either so it low is this more like the logitech so if you compare the EPI one with two not you take Ryan you have in addition this led that reminds you to to charge so it has even more than the epithets that one which is still around $90 or $100 it's still a lot more than if you would buy the cryin and then keep in mind as I said in the beginning you can use the cryin on all your devices one thing is missing though and neither the Apple pencil two or one or the the cryin is working right that it would work on my iPhone because I after iPhone excess max let's big enough to would be great to write on their like the Galaxy Note and I don't mind carrying around a bigger pencil here compared to the Galaxy Note small stylus I wouldn't mind to carry it around if you watched my other video where I compared all the other styluses like from back home and so on and from and on its they make styluses for the iPad pro as well and I showed you these third-party companies we aren't able at all to produce anything like the Apple pencil and that's why I always recommend it to have a pencil however I don't know if Logitech maybe got the patent or something like that that they are obviously allowed to make the same technology and also tech connection wise then it gets really the same feeling as you have an epic pencil and now my opinion is go and get a logitech Ryan that's really worth the money as I said you can use it on all your devices or just buy two of them and you can use it on all your devices and leave one on your one device or the other while when you have an iPad pro 2018 and you have an older iPad or your iPad Mini or something like that then you need to buy the Apple pencil too and you need to buy the old Apple pencil one which is still a hundred dollars so you have to spend dollars to get the EPI pencils you need to use on your all your devices while if you spend twice the money on this one you will only spend not more than $140 by buying this one and all you have to give up is well the shape and the double tap thing there's nothing else I was able to figure out that would be different from all from these two including the tip as I showed you in the beginning so if you liked the video and if you want to stay up to date on the latest ways to integrate paperless technology into your daily life

guys and girls next time [Music]", "BXbBngkuNjY": "[Music] so [Music] so so mr ah [Applause] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] hey [Music] so [Music] uh [Music] you", "GPXTbfPz7SM": "[Music] so this is kind of the most common method like everybody knows this we just wrapped a foil paper on your pencil or pen and it works on screen but yeah one thing you should remember that you always have to put your finger on the foil paper or it won't work [Music] also if something happens via pencil or the pen which were you using the Nietzschean easily change it into another one although this method seems complicated but isn't you just cut piece of earbuds and their rapid with the metal value then we inside this piece of purebred Japan and then stick the hell wire to it and you're done [Music] before using your stylus dampening the cotton with water is important also while using it you have to touch your finger to the metallic wire [Music] the next one is kind of no word metal in this only need is a metal pen which has a curved end so the importance of curved end is that it prevents scratches on screen [Music] and thus you require a special kind of rubber tip which you can find in any mobile stores so what actually happens without any touch this tip or a medal with pure touching touches the tip it acquires a charge and when you place this on your phone screen this gorge acts as a touch [Music]", "o4I5DA3M2zM": "he how's it going guys welcome back to another video and today we're talking about only different types of fellas plans they can get your hands on for digital art and everything else you want to use the stylus pen for with tablets so let's get right into it usually when someone mentions a stylus pen most people think about Samsung Galaxy Note stylus that has a nice pressure sensitivity as well as the hovering cursor when your cells tip is close to the screen as well as these guys and pretty much you'll see these all over the planes and all stores as a multi-function pen like this one that has a flashlight a phone holder at pen and a touchscreen and basically how these things work is they have a rubber dome right here and it has like a capacitive material so when you use it on a touchscreen all it does is literally just mimic your finger just like that and we could do that the same thing like that now these things are pretty horrible usually they'll come in and colored aluminum rod along with the rubber tip like that and they usually break the relevant liable sometimes and run responses and their build quality is just horrendous and again all they do is just mimic your finger so there's nothing special but you can use them on any touchscreen device like the smartphone here or this tablet and you guys can see here it is not responding whatsoever so these things are horrible stay away from them now you want to stay away from these things because there's actually something much better for those who don't have a stylus enabled device and this my friends is a fine point stylus now the way this thing works is actually very similar to this thing except on this one not only has a fantastic build quality it is full aluminum on this one it's got a nice rubber grip but also not only is actually much easier to use and way more responsive but it's actually much more safer to use on your device since unlike the other ones that come in with the aluminum body eventually when you start pressing hard enough the rough trim aluminum tip here on the cheap ones will eventually dig into your screen and cause some damage and that's not cool so let's take a look at this one here's a closer look at what it looks like basically you've got this tapered end just like a ballpoint pen except it's got this rubber piece that does the touching for you a so here it is an action it is pretty simple it does all the basic functionality of touching the screen of course and it's pretty pinpoint accurate it feels nice and it's not going to damage the screen of course but most of all it is very and very reliable one you just wanna point of things and make them work as we can see it works very nicely on the GPD win it is something that will definitely pair it up with now a couple more things as you guys can see the tip here is actually transparent so you can actually see what is going on under the touch area which is really nice and this specific one here it's got a nice end cap that can unscrew and screw it on the back here so you don't lose it and you can go about your business now if you're trying to get your hands on in these guys they go for around three to five dollars when gearbest um they're pretty awesome and definitely cheap they were very expensive a while back a full years ago actually but anyways I'll leave the link in the description and yes let's move on to next one next up we have this weird weird type of stylus now this one actually has a micro USB port on the top as well as a button and an LED right inside of it and you press it the LED turns on and now it indicates that it is activated so this thing has a built-in battery that you're going to recharge to activate this pen now you may be asking does it have any cool functions well believe it or not it does the exact same thing as this guy right here except it has a fine point tip and that's it there is nothing special there is no pressure sensitivity and that is all and these things will only work on a tablet they are made for unlike the other pens we'll be checking out in just a bit so this thing will work on the H I ten plus only exams can see it is not making clean lines it is disconnecting now I did get to fix this issue by taking out the nib and put it back in and fiddling around with it and eventually I got straight lines while drawing but it's kind of pointless it's unreliable it's cost more than the fine point pen over there that just just fine the only benefit I see in this is it feels better I guess but again that is the only benefit I will see over this thing it has got I don't know a pointy tips but really you're just better off getting one of the fine point pens such as this one so again when you see a pen like this that has a built-in micro USB port stay away from it because it will only work with that specific tablet and the most definitely you will not have any pressure sensitivity levels because if you check the product page they won't mention any of that for example here the tech class x5 Pro here in the product page there were nothing mentioned about having a stylist but in one of the pictures there was actually a styler similar to this one that has a USB port that was visible in the picture now they try this one on the tech class and it did not work so so again if you see a sentence like this with a USB port on it stay away from it and save yourself the hassle let's move on next up we have here the Wacom stylus pen now this thing has 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity and this is the best pen as all the pens that I will be showing you guys in this video now these come in a bunch of different variations from tip sizes to feel and grip and whatnot but the base core of these things is they have a tip over here they have two buttons right on top of here as well as an eraser tip on the back so usually how things will work is you would have this tablet hooked up your PC via USB or the wireless module they could buy it as an accessory to this thing and you would start drawing and as you draw things will come up on the screen and basically your screen will be mapped to the tablet itself so if you go to this corner your cursor will automatically jump to that corner on your screen if you go down here the same thing will happen and basically you would draw while looking at your screen and use it just like a mouse now this one also supports a touchpad just like so and it has four different buttons but we're not talking about the tablet here we're talking about the pen itself these pens will only work with the deck sub-grade Wacom tablets such as the one we have wherever here so if you do have a dick top styles like this one it will not work on these type of tablets that being said these are the pens that you will need to get started with the Wacom supported stylus enabled tile looks such as the cube mix + that we have right in front of us here and the main difference between these two guys is these ones are usually much much more accurate where of course they only come with the most expensive tablets that come from Wacom as well as their desktop grade tablets such as the one we have just take a look at all right so if you have watched my cube mix + video you'll find out that I had ordered the wrong stylus but soon after I did order these guys on Express and thankfully for the sake of this video I ordered these two pens right here these ones are both electromagnetic stylus pens that both have tips on the end as all as you button right here and a eraser tip on the back now the main difference between these two guys is that this one actually has no pressure sensitivity whatsoever it is only an active electromagnetic pen that works with these tablets while this one has about a thousand levels of pressure sensitivity which means this is the right pen for this tablet in on a video description of this thing I had put the pen right here as the correct pen to get for the pressure sensitivity so my apologies if you have ordered the wrong one hopefully you can cancel the order and make sure you get this one right here which I did update the video description with with the correct one which is this one right here so anyways let's take a deeper look alright so if you take a look here there's actually a hovering cursor right under the pen tip now we're not touching the screen which means this is an active stylus except the current styles that we have in our hand although it is active it does not have any pressure sensitivity so here's what it look like when you actually try to draw something it is nice it is smooth and it is very responsive and you do have that hovering cursor as well as the useful side button eraser and most importantly the palm rejection because as you guys can see here we can draw with our palm on the tablet itself without having to worry about things drifting and going all over the place but here it does support it and when styles are detected around the screen your palm will be rejected and you can just draw freely and enjoy a really nice drawing session and doodling and whatnot which is just awesome but again this is dependent does not support the pressure sensitivity so let's see how this guy performs all right so this thing has all the functionality that this thing has plus the pressure sensitivity of about a thousand levels which is awesome so let's see how it does yeah it pretty much does this thing very nicely and just imagine yourself drawing or not doing old zooming in and out will begin you know changing the color now the program if you're wondering what the program I'm using here is actually Krita so yeah this actually has really nice edge support the pen goes all the way to the edge the absolute edge of the screen and everything just cross really nicely here is a close look at what the pressure sensitivity looks like so right now we're drawing thin Padron thin as you guys can see extremely thin get to the account level thing and then we can press hard and go just crazy and then slowly fade out and then just like that and then here's another example of what it looks like you can draw very lightly until things get darker and then it can you know shade in places and put some nice shadows and just really enjoy your time drawing with this thing because it's just really awesome and this is the main thing that I really got this tablet for for its wake up compatibility and yeah pretty much is a awesome tablet and I'm going to be actually trying to see how far I can get with drawing because I actually have pretty much no drawing skills whatsoever I can't draw anything well I mean I could draw something but it's nothing special but this tablet this fella right here it's got the specs it's got the display and it's got the functionality to help me get where I want to be in drawing it's got this awesome keyboard too so if you want to type and use it as a multimedia machine then you can definitely do that but anyways guys that is all actually for this video as you guys have saw we have take a look at six different types of stylus pens that all have their own purposes and all of them have their own type of variety they can find online with varying colors and looks and shapes and sizes and one up but basically this is the ultimate pen that you are looking for and that we are going to be using in our upcoming videos for these phablets that we're going to be using to test B tablets with and yeah guys this is going to be quite fun but I guess that is actually pretty much it for this video if you have any questions let me know in the comment section below and hopefully you have enjoyed this video and found it helpful if you did hit the like

all-star black EMR pen so this is based on the All Star Line obviously it is also based off of the all-black you can see it's got the Wacom EMR electromagnetic resonance technology so the pen actually does not need a battery to work and this is pen so it looks like a when the All Star they did change the top cap here to show that it is the EMR pad posts just like a regular pen you'll see here on the front grip section it's got the little button and then the stylus it does come with a replacement stylus as well as the little pieces to the tool to take that out to to replace it once that wears down so for those of you who do not know this would be used with this right so some Samsung phones come with a little stylus pen already they also have the little button on here so when you go to use this so this is the pen that comes with the with the phone this phone at least so as you can see I can put that aside and I can start to use this and you can go to our website there we go and then you can use the pen as a stylus pretty neat again there is no battery needed for this for those of you who are not familiar or familiar if you get close to the screen you press this button and it brings up all these different options and you can you can scroll through to use you can creat notes you can screen write you could do a live message all that good stuff so pretty neat we've we've sold a pretty good number of these and we just got a new shipment in they wish I think we should we should be good for a while although these would definitely have made a good Christmas gift so if you've got

"jTP6Tf9hOfE": "hi everyone welcome to another stylist review this video is for those who are looking to buy a general-purpose stylist so the three styles I have today are the donut mock this is the one and this is the steel o6r and this is the Wacom Bamboo Stylus what distri have in common are their tips the Wacom Bamboo Stylus and the steel sellers they both have this rubber tip now on the donut mark it has some sort of rubber tip but this is also some sort of mesh donut says that this mesh tip is more durable compared to rubber tips like this and it does look and feel more durable however I have not used it to the extent where I can wear out the tip yet so I can't confirm whether or not it's actually more durable and just like typical rubber tips when you press down the tip will deform slightly overall I like the look and feel of this stylus now this whole body is like one piece of metal solid metal when I hit it it feels like that's nothing hollow inside and has a very nice weight more on a heavier side but I think still quite comfortable for stylists like this the body is triangular it has a triangular cross section and the ages are rounded off so it feels very nice the stylus comes in two different colors black and white I like the look of the black one and I like the surface finishing which has a matte surface to it for note-taking and writing purposes I think this stylus performs slightly better compared to other rubber tip starters because of the lack of friction it's smoother here when I write I like to write fast and with rubber tip starters because of the friction it slows me down but with this dollars I can write a bit faster so that's good and of course this does not have pan rejections so if you raise your finger or a palm on the screen and write no lines are going to come out just like other rubber tips Tallis's the tip here is quite big so when it comes to drawing it's going to block off the lines that come out underneath the tip so it can be a bit challenging using this for drawing but for casual drawing I think is not too much of a problem if you want accuracy then this might not be the best tip now another feature of their mesh tip is it is much smoother compared to rabbit hips compared to rubber tips sometimes I feel that they have some sort of resistive feel to it like some sort of friction you know rubber against glass that's this friction but with the match tip somehow if used a bit smoother so that would be one advantage of this mashup versus rubber tips I bought this dollars on Amazon a few months ago at 13 US dollars it's currently selling around 10 US dollars for the price I think it is why rivet for general purpose dollars the build quality is very good and that I think makes it worthwhile getting it if you need a general-purpose stylus that's all for my review today if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below if you want to check out my other app product reviews the link is in the video description below to the playlist that I have thanks for watching see you in the next video bye you", "vpOCa0ZSP3M": "hey guys welcome back to another video today we're going to be looking at a stylus pen that can be very useful if you do need that precision when you're using your tablet or phone so the pen comes in this box like this and it just says active stylus the company name is moco x1 and it is a black pen all right well let's open this up let's see what this thing looks like so we do have a manual looks like the charging USB cable and a thank you card and if you're not happy they'll make it right so this is how the pin comes just like that nothing too fancy alright so this is quite a nice pin to hold it is a little bit smaller than other pins that I've seen but that's a good thing because you don't really want the long pin because this would be easier to manage for sure and it does have this really nice clip here you can see it's got a good weight to it so the body does feel metal and then we have a button here on the top so it's just like a push button so that's kind of cool let's go ahead and push it ok so so it does come on looks like I definitely like the push action because that's kind of like what we're used to depends so and as we go down here we can see the tip and the tip is also an interesting tip here there's a little chrome piece at the end and then here we have the actual stylus part so I don't know exactly what they use on the in here but it feels quite good and rugged it's got a nice resistance to it just a little bit feels just like a pin alright and so it appears to me that this piece here unscrews into the front so chrome piece so it looks like you can change out these fingers here in the front if you didn't you know ruin it and need to change it over time so that's cool alright so let's put that back so overall the pin looks great it's actually quite Aiden attractive pin I definitely like the subtleness of it it doesn't look like anything over the top it looks kind of like a normal pin but it is a electronic stylus bit alright so the next thing that makes me kind of curious is how does it charge and what other accessories it comes with all right so here we have a baggie of stuff and it looks like guys I can see we got 1 2 3 4 extra tips in there so they do give you extra tips that's nice so this should last forever and here is the let's check that out honestly I have no idea where diamond plugs in on the pin so okay so the cable is white and it's magnetic and check it out it's just a round so under looking thing okay so looking at it there's a pin right in the middle of there and then the outside here I guess is also connected well that's quite clever if you look at the pin guys you see the bottom the bottom little ring there that's one connection and then the top of the pin here is another and you can tell that by the are the charging port there so essentially all you do is put it on just like that and it is magnetic I definitely like that it's magnetic that's awesome the only part that's kind of weird is that the cable is not black and I'm guessing is because they have a white version or just a one cable but it's fine and technically unless you use this thing like crazy you won't have to charge it much at all alright and that is the charger and super cool very unique so the way to use the pin is quite simple all you gotta do is turn it on like that and you get to go using it and then when you're done you just turn it off and that's it and I'm pretty sure this thing has an auto off so here in the manual it says that if you don't use it for about four minutes or so so it detects that you're not using it it'll you know turn itself off well that's cool so let's go ahead and give this pin a test run here alright and so here I have the iPad and we have a drawing app already open so we're on pencil right now I'm black hopefully you guys can see this so the first thing we need to do is we need to power on the pin because if you don't it actually won't do anything so once we click it we see the blue light come on and it should start working so and there it goes so I don't know if you guys can tell but it's pretty good for sure and it seems like it's catching up with me really quick but I don't think that has anything to do with the pin I think that is just the iPad here so yeah it seems to work pretty well let's just change it maybe to an ink style pin okay that's nice so definitely like the ink it's pretty nice and it's quite detailed to me you can see I can vibrate it in small sections and it does pretty well over also so obviously this is much better than what you can do with your finger so so let's go to another app here so this is kind of like a coloring app so if you enjoy coloring tapping style you know a pen like this works also very well let's just grab this cake grater so you just choose your color and start coloring and this could get really really fun of course if you do like this kind of stuff so but you can see as quick as I can push it the the pin obviously works very well so an obviously if you're getting up closer you know you can get more details so quite a unique little pin here and you know could be very useful and fun to use with apps on any touchscreen devices so this acts like your finger except a lot more precise and so obviously you know your finger is quite large but this pin has a little point so you can get really detailed with it alright guys so this is the moko pin if you're interested in a pin like this I'll leave some links in the description so check it out and if you enjoyed this video then hit that like button if you want to see more videos like this I do a lot of reviews and other things on this channel so click that subscribe button to see more and as always guys thanks for watching and I'll see you on the next one peace", "YInOW-b4bp0": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] you", "E30Dc3_14v8": "hi everyone welcome to another stylist review I have just received this from donut this stylist is called - and this is the the generation so there are only two things included in the box and it put this away that's the USB charger and Astellas itself this is the small USB charger that's included this pack here is where you put the stylus it's magnetic so the installers would just snap into place like this and again plug this into your computer or USB port and it should charge as you can see the magnet is quite strong be careful not to lose this charger because this is so small I have lost one before for my hardest dollars it was actually in my back somewhere but I couldn't find it because it was too small so let's take a closer look at this stylus and compare it with the second-generation physically the difference is not very significant the starters are available in different colors this silver one is the second generation the clip is still there the body is brushed aluminum that's the power indicator light so when you press the power switch behind it's going to light up instantly and when you press it again is going to switch off instantly and this is the front the gap here for the second generation it's a bit larger compared to the third generation and this part here it wobbles a bit more compared to this part here it still moves slightly but not as much as the second generation and the tip if you note his tip this is a matte surface tip this is a glossy surface tip so this has more friction compared to the the tips are still 1.9 mm in diameter the done it - is made for writing you can draw with them as well but there is no precious sensitivity and no palm rejection so let's test out a new one how well the stylus performance depends a lot on the phone or the tablet that you are using this stylus supports iOS and Android devices if you want to use this on a Windows tablet you can do so as well I'm now using this app called Wacom Bamboo paper this app is available on android iOS and windows devices and I'm using it on the end right right now so this is how it looks like alright let me try and draw some diagonal lines so yes there is jitter with diagonal lines like this this issue or this problem depends a lot on the device that you use because some devices some phones or some tablet stage do not have this issue so it has to do with the screen itself so is this a problem yes it is when you're drawing if you're writing let's see how it performs I donate - rights well enough however because there is no palm rejection you have to prevent your palm from touching the screen if not the stellas will not right and because you cannot rest your palm on the screen writing feels a bit awkward and now let's check out the parallax so if the star is pointing in this direction as I try and draw a straight line it seems that that line appears directly beneath the tip so there is no parallax here but as I turn the stallers into this direction pointing upwards I can see that the line now appears to be below slightly away from the tip so there is definitely some parallax here when the stylus is pointing in this direction versus in this direction if you are using the stylus with by holding it upright like this there's not going to be any parallax but I'm not sure if you usually write it like this I don't I usually write like this so there is no problem if I write like this that's going to be the parallax different devices will have different effects on the parallax so for this tablet this is the Samsung Tab past 3 there is no parallax when the stylus is pointing like this but there is parallax when the stellas is either like this or like this for writing it's fine it's quite responsive and when you're writing fast there is no jitter effect like this so not really a big issue let me switch over to using the iPad this is the iPad pro 2017 by the way how this dollars performs on this iPad pro is not indicative of how it's going to perform on other iPads because the screen is different so let's take a look at the jitter if there is any so the jitter here is very insignificant compared to that on the Samsung Tab s 3 so I can draw diagonal lines quite well no problems let's try to write something this is also Wacom Bamboo paper I actually have a met screen protector on the iPad pro so this gives me extra friction in addition to the mat surface tip on the donut - three so I have more control when it comes to writing it's less slippery on the screen and I'm able to write quite well the letters are captured quite nicely it's quite legible as I have said how well the stylus performs depends a lot on the app that you use - this is penultimate on the iPad I can see that my handwriting is a bit squiggly compared to walk on bamboo crow so the walk on app is able to capture my and handwriting more accurately so how well is able to capture my handwriting depends on the app even though I'm using the same stylus let me show you if there is any parallax I'm going to point a stylus in this direction and draw something it appears that the lines are coming out from directly beneath the tip so no parallax here when the stylus is pointing in this direction and now I'm going to test if there is any parallax with the stylus pointing upwards there is a slight parallax but it's not really a big issue because the lines they still come out quite close to beneath the tip so that's great and lastly let's test this on an Android phone so earlier on with samsung tablet when the Stellar's was pointing like this there was parallax so now let's see if there's parallax so with this Android phone there is parallax here but not if there's Samsung tablet and let's try and draw like this and see if there's parallax there is still product so there is parallax when it's dollars is like this and like this let's try and write something it does feel a bit weird with the parallax when you're writing this phone can capture my handwriting although I do not think that this is quite an accurate capture it's pointless to tell you what phone model that I'm using because the performance of these dollars will vary depending on the phone that you use so is there an improvement from the second generation to the generation well the writing performance is actually exactly the same as the second generation it's just that the physical design has some slight improvement like they are using the matte surface tip now and tip here it wobbles less but writing wise it's actually the same as the second generation and price is the same as well so is this the best dollars for writing unfortunately I cannot give you a concrete answer the answer is it depends on app and the device that you are using so earlier on when I was using this on the Samsung Android tablet it writes quite well with Wacom Bamboo paper but on the phone it doesn't write that well on iPad pro it writes pretty well but that's because of the iPad pro not because of the stylus so how would I read this dollars I think this is a decent sellers they can write well depending on the app that you are using overall the quality's good it's difficult for me to assign a number to the rating like 4 stars or 3 stars because the performance it can vary quite a bit depending on whatever you use alright so that's all for my review today if you want to check out other stallers review you can visit the link in the video description below I have reviewed a lot of statuses before hopefully you can want hopefully you can find one that is suitable for you and device that you use thanks for watching see you in the next video bye you you", "ZsFxuFYEzu4": "welcome to another video today i'll be reviewing this stylus from e-circuit it's a 401 stylus pen that has a pen stylus flashlight and the laser personally the laser is my favorite to open to get the pen you have to twist it we already have an open one right here it only costs one dollar and it is from dollar tree and it works perfectly flashlight great laser i personally love that great it's great for pets and cats as you can see it comes in many different colors and versions a lot a lot slot now to test the pen guys be right back the stylus works great this is the lg stylo we have to place replace a pen and that's how we found this at dollar tree it's a great item they use and it's a great christmas grip now to actually test the pen to get to the pen like i said you have to twist in a second and here the penis see the pen works great silver's great mom stop well that concludes the video i hope you like it and enjoy it might work on um android or app i'm not sure which but i hope you enjoy this product it's very useful and we only bought it for one dollar um", "6TPpb8H_rDU": "over the past few days i've been playing around testing out a bunch of random stylus to see which one of these is actually truly the best alternative of the apple pencil so i went out my way and purchased these different style lists available on amazon which happens to be amazon's top sellers they're best sellers which means they have well over 1000 reviews and they're all verified with an overall positive rating to see which one of these is even considered worth it for anybody on a tight budget the ipad that we'll be using in today's video is my 2020 ipad pro but that won't matter because as some of these will actually work on any touchscreen device including our phones so let's go ahead and begin by starting off the pros of choosing the official apple pencil this way we have a better understanding what does this pencil really have to offer well going with the first party is you get access to a bunch of the new features that apple continues to roll out for ipad os currently my device is on ipad os 14 developer beta so you can still do some of the early things you're able to do like previously on ios 13 like the ability to have quick access to your notes by just tapping anywhere on the display you could easily begin writing your notes with the apple pencil so it not only has those features but inside the second generation apple pencil there actually is some unique hardware in here because not only does it actually have a front pressure sensor in the front this way whenever you're drawing if you apply a lot of pressure the ink pattern will actually be darker get darker to give you that nice shadow effect but here there also are sensors which if you tap on the tip of the pencil you can have quick access to gesture shortcuts which you can have programmed in settings and then some of these other ipad os features is this new one where you can actually write to text if you're searching on a web browser you could literally just write down the word and then the recognition the text recognition will actually get it right you'd be surprised how accurate this thing is so is paying over a hundred dollars 130 for the second generation apple pencil retail price even worth it when sixty dollars less you could pick up something like this logitech and not only that also shares some of these exclusive ipad os features let's go ahead and talk about it and compare the two before we do that let me just say a quick special thanks to paperlike for not just sponsoring today's video but for also making one of the best screen protectors available for the ipad as it does a lot more than just simply offer you screen protection for your device because if you have been following my channel in the past if you see my earlier videos you know that on my all my ipads i always had a paper like screen protector on my main device and this was before they got in touch with me then this matte like texture has a unique technology that simulates a very similar paper-like friction which makes the display feels like you're writing on an actual traditional sheet of paper this is perfect for not just artists but even for general purposes so if you're looking for like the best paper experience on your ipad definitely go ahead and check out paperlike link for more detail will be linked in the description down below and yes it works on all these third-party stylus as well so these stylists that you see here have a price range that starts from 10 all the way up to 70 and then this one by logitech has been out for quite some time now ever since like the first year of the first generation apple pencil and after using it for quite some time it's more similar to like the first generation apple pencil than the second but unlike the first generation apple pencil this is fully supported even on the new 2020 ipad pro the first generation is not supported on the new ipad pros now this being a logitech brand device it does have that unique perk since logitech is somewhat partnered with apple so you'll find that some of these exclusive ipad os features actually is supported on this device like the shortcut ability to quickly take notes by tapping on the lock screen works just fine on this logitech pencil and then in my opinion i think this charges a lot better than the first generation apple pencil as on top here you may have noticed it actually charges with a lightning port you simply just plug it in and a full charge will give this device seven hours of battery life under usage and then the new feature as we recently talked about the ability to write your text is fully supported even on this logitech pencil so there's no need to use the on-screen keyboard when you're typing in stuff as you can literally just write it and the text will be recognized very similar to the first party apple pencil but in my opinion depending on your profession you may find this pencil design to look very unprofessional as it looks more like a children's marker in my opinion than a real professional pen that you will use to sign legal documents with your client but even with this odd design it's really comfortable feels no different as if i was actually writing using a pen and unlike the apple pencil this flat design does have its own advantage whenever you place on a flat surface it's not going to easily roll off as you see it just stays flat in one place just however when you compare it against the second generation apple pencil you do lose the ability to conveniently just attach it on top of your ipad and let the apple pencil automatically charge then another thing you gotta really take in consideration when choosing between this logitech or the official apple pencil you actually have to manually power this thing on every time you want to use it but besides those minor convenience this is an excellent stylus i mean there's no pressure points unfortunately so if you're drawing you do lose the ability to add those extra shades like you traditionally would but some of these complaints i previously mentioned can be easily addressed as there's plenty of accessories you could buy which will actually allow you to even store away third-party pencils so even though you can't just stick it on top like the second generation apple pencil you can buy these inexpensive accessories that will allow you to make sure you don't easily lose this device i covered some of these in my previous video which you can go ahead and watch right here but i'll have a link to my favorite storage accessory in the video description down below overall this logitech one for just 70 dollars is really cool now moving along these next two stylus these two are really interesting again these are amazon top rated stylus for the ipad and both although they look identical are actually listed under two different brands and two different sellers if we take a closer look you see they are very similar in design in fact there actually are a one-to-one clone in my opinion especially when you take a look at the tip really the only two things that set them apart is one actually has a little pocket clip and the other one has this mesh eraser looking thing on top which can be used to navigate your touchscreen and when you remove the cap you'll notice that both charged with the same micro usb port which in my opinion is a huge setback especially in 2020. now i got a search everywhere in my household to find a micro usb cable now those are now becoming hard to come by besides that i guess a pro would be that these can last up to 12 hours under a single charge unlike the logitech one you see it can only last up to seven hours these two can provide the same battery life like the second generation apple pencil and once power on they immediately work and not only that they work on pretty much any touchscreen device including your iphone now the standard one without the pocket clip i bought this one for twenty one dollars and this one was the pocket clip cost me about thirty dollars and again since both of them look 100 identical it's very possible that these can be purchased for much cheaper on aliexpress or alibaba as i'm pretty sure both of these are being drop shipped and they come also available in different color options and even though the tip does push down a bit it looks like it may have pressure sensors it and honestly it doesn't now upon usage i noticed both of them the writing experience is 100 identical and depending on the application it can be buggy because sometimes the palm rejection intervenes just on certain applications you are required to go into the settings to enable finger drawing as both of these do not connect with bluetooth but once you do that they share very similar features just like the logitech one minus the ipad os innovations like the shortcut to the lock screen and such but personally i would just say no to these two especially what i'm going to go ahead and show you next so this stylus is named pony but this is the best bang for your buck if you just want a simple stylus for signing legal documents on the go you can also doodle with it if you're bored but this is 100 battery free as it doesn't rely on a power source or anything to recharge this and the tip of this stylus may look odd but it's actually really genius not only will this front part adapt to the angle of the display but also makes drawing straight lines really easy this also works on pretty much any touchscreen device it works on all applications just make sure you have the finger draw setting enabled the cap is held together magnetically and the build quality is very similar to what you expect on a luxury pen and since it's very inexpensive if you would to happen to accidentally lose it it's only twelve dollars instead of losing a hundred if you lost like the official apple pencil so for a class note taking signing documents or you're just in need of a simple but good stylus for 12 this isn't that bad so this would be the one i would definitely recommend if you just want a simple stylus just to have but if you like to have all your ipad features maybe you own an older ipad that supports the first generation apple pencil but you also own a new ipad pro with the logitech one is supported on both of them so you don't have to buy two separate apple pencils and it maintains its software features so this isn't a bad choice either but if you do want to draw professionally i would highly recommend to pick up the apple pencil because those pressure points is basically the only selling point that i see when choosing between the first party over and something like these third party accessories so i'll definitely recommend considering the apple pencil instead which i go ahead and cover more in detail in this video which you could go ahead and watch where i show you a more in-depth detail on those unique features that the second generation apple pencil really does have to offer and then this video over there that's just a video that youtube is recommending specifically for you feel free to watch either or posters and everything else will be linked in the video description down below anyway folks thank you so much for watching take care and i'll catch you all in the next one see ya", "P54XoMUxwLc": "hey everyone in today's video I'm going to review a stylus that was sent to me from this company called Neko this is spelled as an ek Oh so this is their second generation Steller's that is compatible with all sorts of capacitive touch screen devices basically and it sort of smartphones tablets or even touch screen laptops so let's just unbox this very quickly to show you what's inside we have the warranty card so it has one-year warranty but you don't have to learn any warranty information this is the instructions on how to replace the replaceable tips we have a cleaning cloth and we have two styluses included in this box they come in two colors one is blue and one is black I saw on their website that they are also selling another one which is pink in color so in addition to this two styluses we also have some replaceable tips let me just remove them this replaceable tips they are a bit difficult to remove out of the foam packaging so just press down on the disc here and pull out the tip like this so we have for this this tips included and two of this sort of like rubber tips but this is actually some sort of metal mesh this is how the stylus look like it features a full metal body except for this grip section here which is hot rubber has a good grip on it and let's take a look at this part here where the clip is so when you unscrew this part here it reviews the mesh tip it's a bit spongy but I think this should be more durable compared to those rubber stallers tips when the tip gets worn out you can simply replace it by unscrewing this notice there is this little black ring this is actually a small and this is to prevent this tip from screwing in too tightly you know sometimes when you screw things a bit too tightly it's very difficult to unscrew it that is the purpose of that little rubber ring so it's very easy to replace this tip there is also another rubber ring here outside and this is a screw on type of cap the spongy tip is inside here and now let's take a look at the disk tip which is here so you just unscrew this and screw it back on to the body this is the second generation stylus which features a larger grip and this group actually protrudes out slightly the first generation stallers it has a more streamlined design where the grip is parallel to the body like this this is the disc that is located at the end of the tip and it's connected to the tip by this rubber here this black piece of rubber here you have to use this dollars as it is like this with the disc if you remove the disc it's not going to work so you can press down on the disc and it should return to its original position to replace the tip it's really easy you just have to pull it out slowly like this and put in a new one so you have to replace a tip when it's no longer as smooth when writing or drawing on the tablet and it's great that a company has included four of these replacement tips this stylus is considered a dumb stylus so you don't have to pair it with any tablet you don't have to do any software pairing it just works the moment you touch the screen and now I'm going to test out the note-taking ability as well as the drawing performance of this stallers this stylus does not support pressure sensitivity it does not have palm rejection so it works basically just like a finger drawing but it's a bit more precise because of this tip so let me open up Wacom Bamboo paper the highlight of this dollars is the disk tip you may remember that I have reviewed another stallers with the disk tip as well and indeed I have this is the doughnut jot Pro so you're also features a distant it's slightly different Adonit jot Pro on the right side here it uses a ball type connection see that little ball there that connects the tip to the disk because of the ball type connection is this it doesn't go back to its original shape unlike the rubber connection here there are pros and cons to each design I cannot say that one is significantly better than the other is just different let's test out the accuracy so I'm going to draw a simple cube to see if I can connect the lines without any misalignment and I'm able to do so very easily because the line it always appear beneath the tip this is as accurate as it can be the line is always believed the tip there is no pressure sensitivity though so if you want to change the thickness of the line have to change it through your app if you want lines of varying thickness you can use an app that give you those lines so I'm using titus with sketches Pro now choosing the brush pen so the thin and thick line is they are actually because of the brush style that is applied to this brush let me choose a ink pen so this is one way to get those line variations when the stylus doesn't provide pressure sensitivity you just choose an app that can provide you with those styles when it comes to writing or taking notes it's definitely more comfortable to be able to put your pump on screen like this and write something but because this stylus it doesn't really support palm rejection you get straight strokes like this when you are writing when you rest upon and you take notes and sometimes when your pump is on the screen the strokes they may not appear because the screen is recognizing your palm as an input and not the stylus that's why when you rare sometimes it's very difficult to write to get around a palm rejection problem some people they where the artists glove so that the screen cannot recognize their palm sometimes I like to put something on the screen so that it will prevent my palm from touching the screen and now I can take notes because the disk is transparent as you're writing or drawing it makes it seems like the lines they are coming up from beneath the tip so that's good and this dollars it's very accurate when it comes to capturing and writing earlier on I was using the iPad this is my android phone and it doesn't have palm rejection or pressure sensitivity as well you do not need to pair this dollars with the Android phone these dollars you can use it with any touchscreen devices so to conclude the build quality is great it has a nice weight to it it feels very solid feels really comfortable when held in hand it writes very smoothly and when the tip gets one out there are a few replacements included that is great I agreed to do this review because I wanted to compare the Mikko stylus with a doughnut jot Pro because both stances they featured this type of tips and the performance is very similar the design looks different the build quality well it's slightly different that both are very solid styluses the price point well Adonit jot Pro is more expensive compared to Miko's dollars let's take a look at the statuses and their prices on Amazon so this is the first generation stylus that features a slightly smaller grip the grip here it's parallel this second generation stutters it has a larger grip mahp recruiting grip so for the first generation for 15 dollars 15 US dollars you can get to thousands with some replacement tips for the second generation its US $16.50 so you get two starters with some replacement tips you also have the option to buy three styluses for three salsas it's around us $20 you get some replacement tips as well they have pretty good reviews on Amazon the first generation has almost 3000 almost close to 4,000 reviews and this new second generation it has 200 reviews so to conclude at under us $20 or $15 depending on which bundle you get you get pretty solid build quality statuses that perform quite well for that price point I do think that this is worth the money it's actually quite a good deal if you need a starless that's all for today's review if you have any questions let me know in the comment section and if you want to find out more details about this dollars or find out where you can get one for yourself just visit the amazon links in the video description box below thanks for watching I hope this video is helpful see you in the next video bye", "xCj2WplEhhg": "hello youtube hello internet cyrix KY here I just want to do a video review of this 3-pack of stylus maybe you call it style I don't know but I got them from Amazon and I've put a link to this item in the video description but I'm very impressed these are as you can see they're not short a lot of people said they were too short but they're definitely not as long as a pen as you can see I mean I got a big hand but I mean to hold in your hand they're plenty plenty long so I like how they have a little clip on there and now some of these stylists have a little lanyard which always take off because it gets annoying these didn't come with that which is great but you can put these on your shirt if you want to if you want to look really nerdy just pull it out and start playing with your with your PDA but I like these a lot I know it's weird people say why would you use and these work on multiple tablet computers I use mine on an iPad three people are like why would you use that when you're not taking advantage of the tablet interface well actually it's quite simple and if you've used the tablet for a while you know that even if your hands are clean that you're going to get old from your fingers on there and it just makes a mess so I like to use these makes everything picture quality stay better you don't have to worry about wiping your wiping your iPad off constantly to to make it perform well not that it's that big of a problem but I'm with my desktop monitors and all that I like to keep everything spotless so these stylists this was only a few dollars so you can't go wrong again the tips look really nice it's an aluminum body very solid construction and they come in this pack so should be okay for a while my other one that I had which was nice and I've got a video review of it as well I'll include it within this video's description but the Amazon a basic stylist the tip started wearing out on me but then again I used it every night for a few months so probably did its end to life but thanks for tuning in feel free to subscribe to my youtube channel youtube.com forward slash iron sky and I welcome any comments or feedback that you might have", "7W1_yg0wLSo": "hi guys welcome back to my channel um the reason I got an iPad pro and one of the first things I wanted to do was to an Apple pencil this one here is the official Apple one you see the Apple logo there this is more months it's not mine but I'm just borrowing it for this video so you can see with the Apple pencil you don't need to prepare anything it just works with the iPad you whack your on top it starts charging you can see there and this magnetic so it latches to the top of the iPad so that's pretty nice but it is pretty expensive so in the UK it goes for about 120 quid and I went on Amazon to see what the best dealers were and I stumbled across this it's the stylus pen super fine nib active capacitive so it's kind of a knockoff of the Apple pen and I've seen C's made in China it's got an on and off button where is the Apple pen you done is turn on off not much else that it says on the box really I think it just is the same thing everywhere and yeah I thought I would give it a coat there's a review seem pretty good but yeah let's get it open so that's upside down so as you're open it you've got a user manual you've got a spare nib that just fell out this looks like a cap for the pencil mmm you don't get that with the Apple pencil you get a yep USB type-c charging cable which again you don't get the pencil but you don't need to charge that so I guess this means this has a USB see oh and then of course you've got the pen itself first impressions out the box it does look pretty similar to the Apple pencil I mean the obvious difference is you've got a USB C port here but if you put them side-by-side just put them side-by-side the knockoff is a little bit there's a little bit longer but other than that they're pretty similar it's probably a bit lighter as well but yeah let's give it let's have a look at the actual nibs that both of them you can't nibs on so this is the actual ruffle pencil it's gonna focus on that so that's the actual pencil this is the knockoff and we are they're both pretty similar and yeah they both have a pretty good feel in the hand so just get the user manual up so laughter d and so the top is the top switch to is the type C indicator 3 is a button pause the NIP that's it so says it supports 2018 iPads and iPad Mini the iPad air the iPad air 3 the iPad pro 11 inch iPad for a 12 inch and the 2099 pad so it says 20 hours of use at full power with intelligent power cut this is how to use touch the top of the capacitor pen to turn it on and the indicator light will turn blue to start using it so let's try that ok so the light has gone blue there okay so far it's doing absolutely nothing so it is one not sure what else there is to do don't you think it's Bluetooth it is a Bluetooth no yeah stumbling block this is the Apple pencil this is the knockoff must be something I'm missing okay so this might be a thing if you connect with the app the original Apple pencil you have to disconnect so let's try that okay so straight straight away it's time to work now and so that was my fault not the Pens and so there's a little bit of a pain but let's try it anyway mm-hmm I think you know what I'm actually pretty impressed so you can see like it's a little bit of a thick line then the Apple pencil but this is the test of the stylus just draw a little face it's you know there you can see there's no noticeable like it's pretty pretty fine print as well the lines are pretty thin and it's not as thin as the actual Apple pen but it works in all of the UI as well except for the gesture board you can open apps yep you can do gestures but you can't do that an apple pen either mmm not really seeing a downside here so so I'm not an artist I don't use this I don't use a pen for drawing it's mainly gonna be for note-taking for me um so let's just writing a note taking up it shelf know I scan the magnifier up so this way like about note shelf mr. now this is a test of the stylus so I say I'm actually really impressed with it um it feels pretty cool it feels pretty good quality like I said compared to the Apple pen you'll be hard-pressed to find the difference other than the actual Apple logo and obviously this one is a type C port and just for the Apple pencil back on me that's weird now that pencil doesn't work okay so that's back one yeah I mean there's not that much difference I mean the Apple pencil has pressure sensitivity so you can see as I push down harder it gets darker whereas this one I don't think it has pressure sensitivity so let's try that again yeah it's one one or the other well that's fine again I'm not gonna use this for drawing so that's not a big deal for me yeah if you're looking for just something like note-taking I mean this cost me thirty five pounds or thirty six pounds on the Amazon store um I just turned it off there that's a bit annoying that you can do that it's quite easy to turn back on so yeah I mean the cons of it you have to charge itself it's got its own USB C port but the good thing is it is USB C so you can just use your iPad charger for that you or you can even charge it off the iPad it's called replaceable nibs it comes with a nice pen nib in the box so you've got those options obviously it doesn't attach magnetically to the foot to the side of the iPad like the official one but you know if you have a case like so I'm using the Logitech the Logitech case this has a little holder for a pen so that fits in fine and so that's not an issue for me I mean yeah I'd say if if you know if you're just gonna use this for note-taking then I'd say this is a pretty good plan so I am happy with it so yeah saved myself eighty quid and it's a pretty good pen it's always one other thing to mention because it doesn't actually pair with the iPad you don't get any extra features so I know the Apple pencil you can double tap on stuff you can dub what's up in the pen to change the eraser that kind of stuff but yeah those those are kind of like convenience features I guess rather than anything essential to the operation of the pen I'm pretty happy with it I don't have Lima fusion yet so I can't really try it out in any video editing so I don't know how quite anything in the way maybe but it seems pretty precise you know it's not just not missing anything I thought this is a video I did on the iPads gestures and you add that into you let me add that into a project you can flip through the time lines pretty easily get to go pretty precise control don't see you get pretty nice control over the timelines you can get it pretty exact so that's quite nice if you want to use it for editing that kind of stuff what else so that context so yeah you can tap and hold that you can crab you know this pretty precise see a general use it seems to be as pretty as good as the pencil ready um see I'm actually really happy with this especially a luck so for the price so $36.99 compared to 100 1999 to me is a no-brainer unless you're a serious artist he's doing a lot of drawing on this then you might miss features like the pressure sensitivity that kind of stuff but if you just say if you just want it for casual note-taking which is probably why we use it for mainly I'm pretty open there's a thumbs up for me um any comments questions let me know I'll do my best to answer and yeah I'll catch you guys in the next one you", "_676gZ7GgSI": "I'm gonna be doing a review of the targa stylus pen I just picked this up off the internet or I think about 13 bucks or so it's on sale now and Amazon for six dollars so if you're interested go pick it up so anyways get this thing started pens made out of aluminum whole thing is there's no plastic parts on it besides the rubber tip I wasn't really sure about this I mean I think if I made a pen I wouldn't make it squishy see it's not hard that you can squish it down it's kind of weird so I mean when you're using it kind of to apply pressure to for the tablet or iPad or ever you're going to be using to pick it up because it's not solid it's squishy so anyways to show this thing off I'll grab my tablet really quick turn it on as you can see okay so go over to a draw pad alright so right away I'll show you guys that you need to apply pressure to use this okay I'm but not putting any pressure really on it as you can see I'm touching it see now if I use my finger no pressure at all this nothing there's a little bit but I mean when you use some pressure there you go works yeah so I mean ever it's it works I mean I'm used to using it now and see them there they think fully you really gotta push down on it sometimes it's even a little uncomfortable see miss that little bit right there cuz I wasn't pushing down I mean sometimes feels a little unnatural I don't know and I like it as soon as you can see right there you really have to push I mean I'm it's not a light push either I mean if you lightly do it that's it you get you have to be stick it down on there it's not going to hurt your screen or anything it's just a little uncomfortable but you can get down to you know instead of using your finger if you're using this pen you can get nice little details I mean like if you're and I'm no artist trust me but my sister is pretty good and she's using it she drew some pretty nice photos I don't know if I can there we go she drew that with this thing I can never do that but yeah for the price of if you can get it on sale for whatever it was like five bucks if you can get on Amazon for that I'd pick it up but I don't think I would spend 13 bucks on this I mean it feels nice but I do not like that squishy tip I've used other styluses that had a hard tip they worked perfect but this thing it's it's squishy and you have to apply a lot of pressure for it to pick it up so I don't know if it's decent for five bucks I'd say it's worth it but 13 I think you're better off looking for a different pen so yeah thanks for watching", "FRxuuZ8I_Ag": "[Music] hello everyone in the video today we are going to answer your questions about these active styles so let's start with this does it work with Android phone this is my galaxy s 9 pause we press the button it's on does it work yes it does now have an iPad Mini 4 here let's try and get some notes now let's do these two devices only to disconnect or connect again or anything like this now let's add a Windows tablet here which is my laptop still works we have an Android tablet as well no issues we have an action camera with touch screen pretty good we have what else do we have [Music] camera with the screen and it works here as well what that's pretty cool so I hope that answers your questions so we have 200 devices and iPad OS device some we are software here some wierd software here Windows tablet and Samsung watch and by the way the battery of this one is steel I'm not sure how food is not sure if it's completely full but it's still there and I haven't charged it since the previous video so you have a device with if you have a device with capacitive touchscreen it should work we try it what one two three four five six seven devices so far including this iPhone I'm using to record this video and it works with all of them no setting or anything like this request required just press the button and start using it it's awesome I love it thanks for watching if you have any questions you know what to do and I hope to see in the next one bye bye [Music]", "vylNNSpQUt4": "slated to be the most cross-compatible emr electromagnetic resonance basically wacom stylus pen on the market this is the lamy this is an official lamy pen made in germany designed in germany this one is coming from the lamy hong kong branch but it's lamy all the same this is absolutely authentic it's not a knock off in any way this is sent to us from lamy so when you open it up this is a review sample so this will likely be in a piece of plastic like a little plastic sleeve but here is the pen let's go ahead and look at everything else in the box first you have the two replacement nibs the nib removal tool it's kind of an octagonal shape rather than a just straight up circle and that looks like to be everything else in the box you will see right here this is the certificate of authenticity this was stamped with one of those press stamps so it is a hundred percent real you can see this one did come from the lamy dot co dot hk branch this is the lamy hong kong branch it's oh dot com dot hk right there this one is an authenticity card 2020 so it is a valid lamy pen so knowing that let's get started with what this thing can do it is an all plastic design with a metal super high tensile clip this lapel clip is extremely tight and taut so you'll have to make sure you don't over bend that or over extend that on the inside you will see that there is a little bit of a clear canister with a center core that goes through the pen and the nib pushes in a little bit and you have your secondary button right here with the lamy logo at the bottom now you can actually take this a step further and open it up although you don't have to do that nothing else is in it all of your electronics are in this the rest of it is just along for the ride to give you the familiarity of writing with a stylus pen now let's check out its cross compatibility across several different platforms if you're unsure what cross compatibility actually means it basically means that it works on everything because lamy themselves don't make their own devices lamy doesn't have the lamy note for example they make the emr technology which is this wacom pen technology and they allow it to be used on other devices the onyx books lat max lumi the boyu elita the super note a6 the a5 the a6x it works across all platforms and not only that it works with pressure sensitivity so you can do these light lines you can do these thicker lines like that because the nib actually does push in a little bit again on the boyu nice thin lines thicker lines like that thin lines on the super note thicker lines like that so if you get this pen it is an all-in-one you can use it on your boyu your muses your memos you can use it on all the levels the a5 the a6 the 6x you can use it on the lumi you can use it on basically anything and it doesn't matter if it has a glass screen protector or a rubber screen protector or no screen protector this is going to function with the devices and we will have a whole list on our website on goodyreader.com blog shop telling you what devices this does or does not work with the lamy pen is an investment because it basically works on any wacom device so if you're worried about your stock pen being underperforming a little bit lacking compatibility cross compatibility the lamy pen is the way to go because it looks great it performs great it works on everything overall it's a great overall purchase for goodyreader.com and an overview of the lamy pen this is peter [Music] you", "Tui6g1AGs_g": "you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]

designed for not taking on the iPad the iPads that are supported by this dollars are the ones made in 2018 or newer more specifically iPad 603 iPad Mini 5 and iPad pro the generation now this unit that I have here this is actually a review unit that was sent to me from Adonit this stylus features a 1 millimeter tip which is a fine tip this is great because when you are writing or even drawing this is not going to block the lines so you can still see the lines while you are writing this is the power button on the side and you can press once to switch it on instantly press it again to turn it off we have this very shiny glossy clip and on the back here this is the micro USB charging port for the pen so this pen has a rechargeable battery inside and the battery life is said to last up to 12 hours of continuous use now if you are short on battery life you can charge it for 4 minutes for 1 hour of use this pen this Dulles is available in two colors black and go so the one that I have here features the black body with a matte surface which is really nice to hold it's very solid looks very well built and fused very sturdy the stylus feels rather comfortable to hold the tip is actually replaceable so you can unscrew this to replace it when it's one out or if it's blunt you can buy the replacement from a donuts website other than the pen the other things included in the box are the micro USB charging cable and Quick Start Guide there is actually not a lot of instructions to read is just on and off now this stall as it doesn't require pairing so once it's on you can start using it straight away on your compatible iPad let's switch this on and try writing something so the blue light is on the app that I'm using here this is Wacom Bamboo paper so this feels very responsive it looks like this combination of the stylus and the app it's able to capture my handwriting quite accurately and there is no lag at all there is no input lag so there's no gap between the line and the pen tip while I'm writing this iPad by the way is the iPad pro that generation from 2018 palm rejection works relatively well so while I was writing this I didn't see any stray strokes which is great right now I'm using this app called Procrit which is an app for Troy now this dulles it doesn't support pressure sensitivity so you're not going to get the thin and thick line variation just by pressing hard or applying more pressure to change the language you would actually have to adjust the settings you can definitely draw with this stylus but just note that you're going to get uniform lines all the way if you use an app that support some sort of software stalling you can still get those thin and thick lines for example with notes plus when your stroke is fast your lines will be thinner this is actually software stalling this is not pressure sensitivity working they're not taking performance of this dollars it's really good on all the note-taking apps that I have tested on they were able to capture my handwriting very accurately the app that I'm using here it's Nabal and it can convert my hair writing into editable text and here it was able to read my handwriting with 100% accuracy the pen tip actually has some matte surface coating on it so it provides friction when you are drawing or writing on the glass surface so this will provide you extra true when you are writing here's a strange thing about this stylus this Dallas doesn't require bluetooth pairing once you switch it on it would work straightaway and for some reason the iPad is able to know that this is a stylus and not your finger so if I were to write the same letters with my finger you can see that the lines are thicker but when I write with the stylus the lines are now thinner and what is this bar here if I were to drag up the bar with the stylus nothing would happen but if I were to do this with my finger it actually drags up the bar and icons so when you are writing the note-taking apps we know that the input is from a stylus rather than your finger and I think this probably contributes to why the palm rejection works flawlessly one feature which was advertised but I wasn't able to get it working is the tap to open up the Notes app feature so when I tap on the screen nothing happens when I attempt we have the Apple pencil it works but not with the donuts tallest oh by the way if you have any styles that is pair with your iPad via bluetooth you do have to disconnect them impair them before you can use the donut note a donut note doesn't replace the Apple pencil so this is just an alternative and if you are someone who doesn't need pressure sensitivity this is actually an excellent stylus for us $50.00 the Apple pencil that's support pressure sensitivity that's the main difference between this two and this is 129 US dollars so that is almost 80 US dollars more than this so if you just need a stylus for taking notes for clicking things tapping around this is a much more affordable option this Dallas is able to capture handwriting very accurately there is no misalignment between the line and the pen tip the line is always directly beneath the pen tip and pressure sensitivity works really well so overall I would give it an a-minus maybe because the tap to open the Notes app function it doesn't work even though he was advertised but one is not taking 5 out of 5 stars easily if you are interested to get this dollars you can check out the three links in the video description below see ya", "OqRW9wfplm4": "okay so I wanted to go over something here that came across for the longest time I remember when I got my I have a HP Envy laptop it flips around you know you can use this tablet touchscreen is pretty nice it's got a pretty good deal on it too and I remember one of the weeks by god it was because I wanted to use Autodesk SketchBook on it because the touchscreen feature I figure out you know you can using stylus whatever you could it was a little as long as it has a little rubber tip whatever but it was kind of knowing those rubber tip styluses you know they start dragging and pull after a while and I got annoyed with that so I was like alright maybe I'd invest money into one of those for chargeable styluses meant for you know drawing on digital digital and I came across a thinglink bamboo it wasn't compatible I think there was another different bamboo um with chargeable stylus that one didn't work either something like nothing so there's nothing really I could find at the time when I first got this from here or this laptop I mean that was when I first got I was over a year though I think and just recently this past weekend I remember oh no I saw something at Walmart I figured you know it's been out for a while there'll be something you know off-brand I mean there was planning stuff for Apple and stuff like that but it was hard to find something for my HP Envy and I finally I remember I saw a rechargeable stylus buzzing 20 bucks and it's Walmart and I never heard of this brand but I said screw it I'd give it a try this is it right here oh you can see it I got the gold one just goes my wife says that a character you go for a black one but silver one whatever but as you can see it gots a fine tip okay so it has a heart too but you can see it's a fighter so it's like that it writes like a pin and then you got the other end there looks like a little microphone I know it's pretty cool and it's just it's like this regular rounded off silences it but it's smooth it's not made of rubber so it just go eyes beautifully I guess it's compatible if anything because I tried it out last night I want to effort about it and I charge it it says here in the package it's a 12 hour battery life and I'll tell you the name of it it's up it's by black web you can see their black whip and it just says chargeable active stylus fine tip for position writing a hand drawing so power position tip provides increased accuracy versus traditional unpowered silences true I established that last night aluminum construction USB cover functions as a backup be incredible sales tip the time about this and includes a one-foot yes USB charging cable so this is the the backup tip that song love it's magnetic right here it snaps on because of magnet but as you can see that's where you get up to charge it and it touches pretty quick right off the box right out of the box so pretty cool you don't have to like sink it or anything he's just charging and you just push this button shows you dance on and I'll show you a little bit on it inches on the low assistant so finally found something that I was trying to find and it turned out to be some again a black web at Walmart for like I think I was like 22 and change but yeah alright so y'all just show you a quick demonstration on let's go with colors so I have it on as you can see the blue light means it's on when you're charging it just if it's red when you're charging it means it's still charged wants to turn blue it's done charged so let's go over here with this increase the size I'm using a Autodesk SketchBook so I'm just gonna mess around with these just to show you like how it works and stuff so it's on you don't have to like go into the Bluetooth setting or anything just start that's a fine tip and you can just switch over and this one I don't like that much like I have issues with this on that works awesome on my phone but so yeah glides Easi I know it's a little rough I'm having a hard time too because I'm trying behind the camera here but yeah like I said 20-some bucks 22 and change Walmart have you been looking for something like this to and we're struggling there you have it again that is a black web and this is what the box looks like right here and of course it comes with the with the USB cable to charge it I have that in the kitchen right now is charging it earlier but yeah I'm happy with it I'm happy with the purchase and cuz I'm having a hard time drawing here Lane sorry that's straight as I'd wanted to be but it does what I needed to do boom so yeah just thought I'd share that and you know for whoever else might be going through what I was going through and like I said it also works on my phone marvelously I actually was using it today because I'm working on Incredibles digital pick there and yeah it just works phenomenal my phone this part and his end the tip around the tip works better on my phone than it does on here but this part works awesome on both my phone and on my laptop so yeah that's that is all just want to share that with you guys if you guys already haven't used this before and you want to give your thoughts on that go ahead and do some of the comic section comment section not coming call me except you can't speak right now yeah that is also I hope if you were looking for something like this that this video is helpful now you know somehow you can test it up yourself didn't like it you can always turn it at his Walmart as long as the undersea I'm sure it's no issue so yeah that is on you old you guys have a good day bye", "HjTO1ImMdrg": "[Music] - what's going on okay so you see I have an Apple pencil here but that is not what this video is about today I am going to unbox this alternative cheaper stylus pen active stylus pen - Apple pencil I mean looks good feels good haven't used it but I opened it to see what it looks like so first we're gonna see what its compatible with pretty much the same thing that the other well the regular Apple pencil is compatible with I'm using the generation one I can't really speak for the generation - Apple pencil but this kinda sorta looks like it and it even is magnetic and will attach to the iPad pros so let's open it and let's take it out of the nice little plastic sheath thingy thing give it an overlooked physical power button one piece no removable cap quite sure the tip is replaceable so I also noticed there's a little hole here so let's go ahead and get the rest we have a USB little thingy thing for charging what do you call this tip I don't know so that goes in there and boom you know of course where this goes and you jus seam up you have a replacement tip and paper work instructions and whatnot charge it use it go so let's bring this iPad over here iPad seventh gen we are going to remove this completely just forget this device so then we are going to open up our notes and we are going to get a fresh note and let's see the magic so first things first we're going to write up nothing happens right so we're gonna turn it on it's on it's not connected by bluetooth let's go back to the bluetooth menu it is definitely not connected by bluetooth you see nothing is saying it's a pencil connected or anything so let's go back to the notes and voila all you have to do is power this thing on and it works it feels great it feels better than the generation 1 Apple pencil doesn't have removable parts that you could possibly lose even though the top is magnetic and sticks on everything I like this pencil it's really uh fluid palm rejection you know I got my palm on the screen like I'm pressing like I actually have my hand on the screen and I'm going there's nothing nothing stopping me let's see I'll put this finger on and we have an issue oh not this time wait I guess it's just something that I'm doing so palm rejection is definitely a go I like it so this is a pretty awesome I mean it works does what it's supposed to do and you know if you turn it off that's it it's not connected by bluetooth so there's no extra battery consumption from your iPad that's definitely a plus just do a little thing I mean let's see about the tip it comes with a replaceable tip but I'm not sure on how to replace it quite yet up there we go don't feel like it's screwing but it's actually scrolling all you got to do is like place it between your fingers and it's really small and it comes right out that's nice say can I get it back in here's the question hmm excuse me bump the camera a little bit oh so let me see this may be the awkward part about it uh-oh let's see what we got here no everything is fine I've just got to slow down okay so yeah I like it 40 bucks 40 99 something like that well worth it I actually think I'm gonna keep using this and uh I may sell this first gen Apple pencil now since I have this and I like it I used to be anal about different stuff like you know I want all Apple stuff like so but this may replace my Apple pencil fits in my holder in my case yes definitely a go I'll leave all that information in the description you know the link all that kind of stuff the guys that wanted me to do a review honest they may give me a discount code for you guys so make sure you stay tuned and wow I'm just amazed a little bit I actually really didn't use this till just now and I like it a lot so check it out you might might be interested thanks for watching I catch you guys in my next video I'm out of here", "RTyKZlHVYLs": "[Music] today I have a digital stylist for you it's it's a basic stylist designed to use with Android devices and iOS devices pretty much any touchscreen device basically it's a cheap stylus I bought it for five hundred rupees from Amazon dot to spend a lot of money if you want to buy this but this video is all about whether you should buy this or not it doesn't have a bluetooth or any kind of a digital thing to connect it with your Android device or iOS device this is just a basic stylus you open the cap and which you find underneath is the tip of the pen so you don't get a fine tip but a disc instead this technology is not very new I think jot Pro is the company which brought this technology of using a disc instead of an nib there are some styluses of them in the market which are expensive like five to six thousand rupees and I think they also support friend pressure sensitivity on the other hand this is a very simple stylus it doesn't support any kind of pen pressure sensitivity and this is just a piece of metal the body is completely made out of metal and it looks really nice it looks good a little smaller than my cell phone by the way this is a redmi note 7 pro cell phone and I have used it earlier with n tablets like Huyen H 640 P we on HS six phone and eco pro from XP Pen there were other options as well which were expensive but you know it didn't really make sense only if I had something like an iPad pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab I could have bought expensive one but because I have this small Android device I could only buy this cheap stylus because it was just like an experiment I don't really draw on Android much but to find out whether these cheap styluses are they really worth your money this pen is compatible with any kind of a touchscreen it is very good in terms of swiping your home screens and opening apps even for using keyboards sometimes but this is not very accurate and I bought this thing to show you whether you can use for drawing purpose for illustrating and designing on your cell phone the mobile apps are used to test this particular stylus our iris paint Medibank paint adobe sketch SketchBook Pro and flipper clip so there are a lot of students out there who are still looking for these styluses like a get away solution but unfortunately these silences are not that good so there are a number of problems and there are a number of issues I faced by using the eld stylus the first one is the jitter and the lag all of these drawing apps on Android they all support pen pressure-sensitive styluses and hence something like Adobe sketch which only support a stylus with pen pressure wouldn't even recognize this stylus I was not able to draw even a single stroke on Adobe sketch I was trying to draw fine lines but actually I couldn't because of the flat disk in front of the pen you have to draw again and again in do corrections this pen is not accurate just do not go by the transparent in disk it has in the front it doesn't let you see through the second issue was the compatibility with the apps when I used who Yan or XP pen tablets with these Android apps they were working beautifully very smoothly without any lag or something but a basic drawing app like sketchbook grow and even marry bad paint they were lagging while being used with the stylus the experience was really really bad and I don't really think I could draw further with this pen I thought really say anything else about it it doesn't really matter whether this pen looks really nice it is made up of metal but it doesn't do what it is supposed to do that's it this pen is completely useless for digital artists I bought it I tested it and I came to the conclusion that you shouldn't buy this and at all this is worthless and if you are still looking for something to draw on your Android cell phone I would really really recommend that you put a is your budget for you to little saving or by any other means you go for something better which you can also use with your laptop and your computers as well just like we own at 640 P or deco Pro Series from XP pen all of those tablets are really useful and even if you want to take quick notes or even if you just want to write something on your tablet or on your Android phone this is not going to work at all you can write but eventually you are just going to throw of age and that's for sure that's it for today and I had to do this video because I know that a lot of you are still thinking about you know buying cheap styluses to draw on your phone or something like that please don't do that do not waste your money that's it if you like this video hit the like button if you want to share this video with your friends who are looking for such styluses to stop them also hit the subscribe button and the bell icon so that you get the notifications for my future uploads I'll see you later [Music] [Applause]", "Rq6qQWPnlQU": "[Music] hello everyone today we're going to have a look at a stylist from Versailles this is compatible with any device that has a capacitive screen so it should work on most phones tablets and even some laptops as you can see here on the box it's also got a built-in and a writing on normal paper that will open it up and see what's included in the box here's a pan itself and it's all made of metal with a rubber area for better grip in this little pocket in the box there's an extra disc style tip let's just put that back in the pocket so we don't lose it now let's have a closer look at the pen itself it's made of metal and looks quite good if you went through the first cap you will find the normal pen it's just a normal pen so there's really not much to tell about it it works fine and is smooth to write it on the edge of the cap is a small metal quick the buzzer is written on it under here is a touchscreen disk tip it's quite flexible so it should be comfortable to write and draw it it can also easily be removed from the pen itself just prove gently and it will slide out using a pen on the screen is very comfortable there's almost no resistance when moving it around and there's no need to put any pressure on the tip letting the tip float on the surface is enough let's try some handwriting in Google clip as you can see it also works very well and is comfortable to use don't judge me by my artistic skills with a few years of training you can also do art like this typing on the keyboard and surfing is also nice this very precise and there's no gaps in the lines when drawing or writing here's another art piece for you to enjoy can you guess his name say hello to potato boy down in the comments one of the main reasons why I got this stylist myself was to use it for editing pictures I do a lot of editing in ups like Snapseed and it's easier to use a stylus for this it also prevents its merging on the screen with fingers for such an affordable price is a very nice stylus it's way better than those services with big black tips I especially like the build materials the precision of the tip and how smooth the tip is on the screen I can hardly feel any resistance at all thanks for watching this video and remember to comment like and subscribe have a nice day you", "ACx7BXf8qJc": "hey everyone this is teal from Taco Blox calm today we are going to unbox the Wacom Bamboo ink stylus and test it out since this is an odd channel I'll be using this stylus for drawing and see how good it is at drawing this is designed for Windows 10 and and able devices you can find a full list of compatible devices and this website so this is the web page and there is a long list of products included I see Acer Asus Dell Fujitsu HP Lenovo Microsoft of course Toshiba bio so before you get this dollars make sure you check the compatibility list the price for this stylus is currently us $52 on amazon.com it's quite a pricey stylus but of course not as expensive compared to $200 Microsoft Surface pen oh this is quite tight so that's take a look at the pen first of all excellent boot quality it has a nice weight to it it feels very solid I love the matte surface texture I love the color of this pen matte black the tip has some movement to it two side buttons here one button on the back and this is where you can twist to open up to replace the battery just twist it and you can pull this part out and this is the battery that's included there is no label anywhere that tells you which side that battery should go in so means actually at this point the end that is facing the pen clip so let's put this back in and twist it back this is the pen tip it has some texture on it so when you are writing it this is the pen tip there is some movement to the tip now this is a textured tip so it provides some friction and this gives you better control when you are writing and drawing on director surface the other thing that is included is this little plastic case with some replaceable nibs so if you don't like the default nib you can chop them up with is three so this is the smooth this one this is great for writing very fast this has a little bit more friction compared to this but I will consider it is to be quite smooth as well this is the default tip this has more friction great for drawing the nib remover is built into the side of the case very easy to remove the nib you do not need to pair this pen in order to use it once the battery is in you can really use it with your Windows Device but if you choose to parent you will have access to additional features and to pair it you just have to pull this button on the back for six seconds and the light should start blinking so I'm going to pair it with my Microsoft Surface pro 2017 and it's pad now that I have had a stylist I have access to some of the shortcuts by pressing the back button so if I press one I can open up OneNote or choose from the different failable functions here which is actually quite limited if I double click I can print screen and draw on that straight away if I press on hope I can open up sticky notes I think I shall just leave all this at default this is Windows pen settings not some Wacom driver so there is very limited functionality I am NOT able to customize these two side buttons the button here closer to the tip this is the right click and this is sometimes the eraser button to change the pressure sensitivity you have to open up the surface app and there is only this slider that allows you to change the pressure sensitivity I usually set it at three or four maybe three let's test out the shortcuts so I'm going to do a single click it opens up OneNote double click you should take a screenshot and you should be able to draw on it there's pressure sensitivity and click and a whole this you will bring up the sticky notes so it's quite responsive works well time to test this out so I'm going to draw a cube or all right this is not good this is definitely not good the lines they are obviously very wavy let me switch over to the Microsoft Surface pen which is two times more expensive and the line it's noticeably straighter even we're not drawing at a very slow speed so this is not good for drawing let me draw a moderate speed accuracy is pretty good the cursor as you move the pen close to the screen the cursor will come out so that's where the line will be and it is very accurate so when you are drawing at moderate speed it's fine the lines are straight but when you slow down slightly the lines they start to wobble not very good let's test the buttons here so this button is the right click and when you hold and click you get this option by the way there is one stretch from here so palm rejection not perfect the other button here this is the original button so that's the advantage of having two buttons there is pressure sensitivity and it works pretty well I've got to tell you about this app this app is welcome and blue paper this is SketchBook Pro okay performance not very good broken line here even though I did not lift my pen and it wasn't able to get the pressure consistent here broken lines again and take a look at is I was drawing really fast but the pressure consistency it's really not there so when I draw very far as the pressure should be constant because I cannot control my pressure very my pressure that much while drawing very fast and this is what you get this is not good at all this is unusable let's compare that to the Microsoft Surface pen so obviously the surface panel works much better there is inconsistency as well but not as drastic as obvious compared to the bamboo ink ten this is MIDI Bank paint Pro pressure works well but there are those are really irritating you know the cursor tracing lines it's quite responsive pressure works really well let's do some diagonal strokes okay not that nice I see wobble again and it's very obvious so it's very obvious this is the surface pen very straight line so if you want to draw some perspective lines with this pen well there is going to be a problem you have to draw pretty quickly sometimes when you draw the curve you want to be a bit slower so they can get that accurate curve but here you draw slow it's going to give you that whatever you learn with this stylus this is Krita diagonal lines have a wobble effect again not very good so this is the surface pen I'm gonna draw it at same speed see the difference let's see if it's catchable on sketch a ball again some wobble with the diagonal lines this is not good at all one straight stroke there so face pen another straight stroke there so palm rejection it's not flawless so this is well this is what it is the last step I want to try is a Photoshop lines look smooth to me that I'm drawing at moderate speed okay let's see what happens when we slow down again some wobble some jitter surface pan again obviously the surface pan has better performance if you are going to be using this to take notes I don't think there is going to be any problem because when taking notes people usually write faster anyway I will make a separate video just for note-taking performance with installers the drawing performance of the Wacom Bamboo ink it's not that good and is not as good compared to microsoft surface pen the slow diagonal lines they have very obvious jitter and that to me is a deal-breaker if you want to get stall as a general-purpose dollars just for clicking tapping scrolling and writing I think this is a very good choice because it's half the price of the surface pen but when it comes to drawing it's best to go for the more expensive but proven product at least the lines here they are much as there so it is what it is I'm going to put out two more related videos one will be on note-taking and handwriting performance of this dollars the other video will be comparing various windows surface pen alternatives so remember to subscribe to my channel to catch those videos when they come out and that's all for my video today thanks for watching if you have any questions let me know in the comment section below see you bye", "XsnuohYMnf4": "hey all here OS reviews you're watching our video first look and a quick review of the Wacom Bamboo alpha this is a capacitive touchscreen stylus that retails for fifteen dollars and the street price is even lower which makes that one of these most affordable models in Rackham's collection now unlike a lot of their more expensive products this one isn't pressure-sensitive so if you're pressing harder it's not going to give you a thicker or firmer line it's just one pressure one stroke across unless your touchscreen is something like the iPad pro which the screen itself is pressure sensitive then it will still give you adjustable levels of sensitivity the cost here is very again affordable but we still have a relatively good construction quality that's made out of aluminum so as a quick note taking a stylus if you don't want something really fancy especially if you're not a graphic artist you're just a student you want to sketch something really quickly this could be sufficient for you know what you're looking for the packaging here is very simple what's interesting about the Alpha is even the nibs are also replaceable so the rubber end when it gets worn out after using it for let's say a year or two you can actually replace it and find parts pretty easily online the entire thing again is fairly lightweight it has a clip as well which you can tuck away on a shirt or onto a backpack about the same size as a standard ballpoint pen and again it's pretty easy to use for drawing on a touchscreen or on a tablet or smartphone just like with a pencil and paper has a fairly ergonomic shape and Wacom is also pushing for a few of their free applications on iOS on an on android so we have something like bamboo paper which is a note-taking app that works actually pretty well especially with a stylus like this and you can save your work and upload it to the cloud and access it on a computer which is a backup copy which is again pretty convenient for students and designers out there so this is what the stylus looks like on the back there's also a very quick kind of manual slash warranty guide that tells you how to twist off the rubber tip to replace it and that's pretty much it so very simple presentation here we're taking a look at the design of the bamboo alpha first as a for mentioned this is a very simple and again low cost stylus the tip here though does is made out of rubber as opposed - let's say a plastic circle so it's not going to be a precision stylus it doesn't have a really fine small tip again it's not an active stylus either so it doesn't require battery doesn't require a bluetooth for pairing you simply start using it immediately and you can see it has a fair amount of a give to the overall tip but as a as a whole still feels firm enough that it doesn't have add too much resistance when you're pressing across the display we can rotate this aluminum cap clockwise to remove it and this is what it looks like underneath and we can further rotate the rubber tip to completely replace it in case it gets worn out from the top here we also have the bamboo logo and a clip as a for mentioned which is made out of plastic but feels relatively well made especially since the body here is made out of aluminum and overall it's a very slim stylus it's comfortable to grip feels economic just like a standard pencil but it's also not something extra bulky or quite as large as something like a Sharpie pen for instance here's a quick size comparison even though it has about the same length and another fine tip Sharpie has a closer overall dimension finally here's another stylist this is the one that came with the Lenovo yoga book and you can see that the yoga book stylus is a little bit thicker and this one has what I was referencing before as a fine point which is more useful for graphic artists and people needing precision but this rubber tip again is good enough especially for handwriting and for general doodling as well as forgiving to kids if they want something to sketch with on a tablet so overall that's the size comparison so let's talk about the performance and to do that I'm going to open up a drawing app on a tablet and do a quick test of how well it works so I'm opening up ArtRage on the yoga book tablet so if we zoom out a little bit well we can see hopefully that's the experience works actually pretty well so you can see that the touch screen sensitivity remains actually very high and although it's not the most precise in terms of having a little bit of parallax it still works fairly well I can adjust the size the type of brush that I want and I can start writing away so you can see there's a slight delay but overall it remains actually pretty sensitive so expecially of them tapping somewhere you can see that it's appearing and it's actually pretty close to what I want despite the fact that it's a rubber tip so you can see the movement of the tip of the tip here as it glides across the screen it doesn't have that much resistance it still feels quite easy to use and smooth which is nice on a glass surface let's go back to the pencil here so I'm not applying that much pressure and it seems like the strokes have all been registered so that's definitely nice to see just a slight delay but overall for note-taking it seems like it will work quite well obviously there's no palm rejection so if you put your hand on the tablet that will still kind of interfere with the experience but it certainly works a lot better than I expected especially as a rubber dome stylus and for a quick maybe signature or something like that on a PDF document it works much better than just using your finger directly overall sensitivity is about the same I would say and again it's pretty easy to doodle to box annotate and to do a few quick highlights for instance if you are a student it definitely makes the process feel at least a little bit more natural when it comes to handwriting a larger text tends to work better what I mean by that is with this particular soft rubber tip if you're drawing something really small it becomes a bit more challenging so for instance you have been doing something with tiny font you can tell that it becomes harder to make out although handwriting recognition will still work versus something if you write larger than it becomes much more legible and also it seems like slightly more responsive so if you're someone who has really small handwriting then this might not be again the perfect stylus for you I would prefer something that has a disk design or a plastic tip which gives you more precision for rubber again the best thing is writing slightly larger for signatures for highlighting and for general doodling and drawing slightly are larger objects things like that that don't require that super small level of precision but overall you can see that in general it works actually pretty well for a passive stylus in particular I think that Wacom you know made a pretty smart design here because everything you know it's actually quite responsive and the fact that you can replace a rubber tip is unique I haven't seen that on any other passive stylus before in the past if we compare that to the you know active styles if the Wacom board a pressure-sensitive board open we can see that I can press very light for light stroke and also harder for a harder stroke so it gives you more of that experience it's closer to an actual pen and paper but also this kit or a regular active stylus of course is much more expensive getting a quick look at the bamboo paper app again it's great for journaling and note-taking especially if you don't have a drawing app pre-installed on your tablet already when you first log in it tells you to set up an account if you want to save anything and sync it to the cloud and afterwards you're ready to go and you can actually create different journals dedicated for different tasks for instance I can create a journal just for a specific class or for a particular meeting and when I want to look at it I shouldn't app on it and I can create different pages very easily on the top here I can also tap to create a different type of utensil so switching between a pen and a pencil changing the stroke as well as the color and all these things can also be done with the stylus really easily so here's a test and you just tell how again fluid the overall experiences even with applying almost no pressure at all on the display it all seems to work without no problems especially again for a larger doodling and note-taking things like that if you're not writing something that's super tiny and requires some more precision so as a whole as far as passive stylus Cisco this is probably one of the best that I have checked out so far just in terms of the accuracy and the fact that Wacom has also brought out an ecosystem and app that you know works well for note-taking in conjunction with this stylus and some of their other models in their collection so it's more or less it for our review of the Wacom Bamboo alpha if you are on a budget and you're looking for a low-cost stylus for doodling as well as for a quick note taking this is actually a great option now if you already have an iPad pro or a tablet that has a pressure-sensitive stylus such as on a surface it doesn't make quite as much sense to pick one of these up but if you have a typical tablet that doesn't have built-in pen support and you're looking to add a stylus at an affordable price then the Wacom Bamboo alpha is a great choice especially for under $15 I would say that this is a great fit for most consumers out there as long as you are using it casually and not you know if you're not an artist and you want the most precision or you must have pressure sensitivity then again this price point it's a difficult this really resists you can check out more details about this in our official article but for now this has been our video thanks for watching here at OS reviews this has been our review of the Wacom Bamboo alpha", "m0bEqkoUU60": "what's going on average tech guy here and today we are back with more tech and more reviews i got a lot of questions about this stylus right here for your ipad pro and your ipad models that are apple pencil accessible this is from the company zag this is the pro stylus and yes i like it so let's check it out okay so here we go finally got it in hand this is the pro stylus from zag now keep in mind just like all of your other apple pencil replacements this thing is not going to work while your apple pencil is connected to your device so i've already disconnected it now let's talk more about it so actually looking at the box this is the pro stylus it has tilt recognition palm rejection comes with a replaceable tip full day battery on it has a battery level indicator on it and it has usb type c charging it actually is an active stylus as well as a broad tip stylus on the top now you may be saying i'm never going to use that broad tip stylus never never never in a million years but what i'm here to tell you right now is that if you use procreate this broad tip stylus will come in handy you may be saying why is that so i'm just going to open up a drawing that i was doing just playing around and let's say you are drawing something and you're making your circles and this thing really works like there are no issues there are no breaks it does have tilt recognition you see it'll actually go into like a little shade type deal and then if you turn it straight up and down it's going to work and if you want to shade some more you're shading your tilt recognition is on point nothing to worry about but let's say you're using this and you say oh i made a mistake well in procreate you don't have to use your finger anymore you just flip it over and use this like a regular eraser on a pencil now that's one of the things that i found that was really interesting and i really like that feature about it number two the thing the other thing that i love about a stylus that works with your ipad is that this thing does mostly everything that the apple pencil will do one of my favorite features is to take a screenshot just from that corner and have it to just work there are no issues there so one thing that i found that didn't work that i would i would love to have work would be the tap to wake feature so you know anytime you tap with your apple pencil it comes on in notes but one workaround to this is to actually touch here first with the broad tip and then double tap with the stylus tip and it will actually bring up your note application and then you can just come in and take your notes and scribble as you would like speaking of scribble it still works there we go and just some little scribble at the end to make it look really good but scribble does work there are no issues with it it works and functions just as it would with a regular apple pencil now the real estate on this is very simple you have your removable tip and with your removable tip all you have to do is just basically screw it off and screw it off and you can replace it just like so and then you have your broad tip which is right here it actually sports a zag logo and you probably can't see it because my lighting is really bad right now i'm working on that and right here you have your broad tip actually lets up to open so that you can see your usb type c charging port and basically that's it you get ready to turn this on battery indicator lights up letting you know that it is on and ready to go and when you want to write very simple very smooth very fluid i can't say a whole lot more about it other than it's magnetic magnet is really strong on here and you don't have to worry about it falling off you can put it in the case and it fits most of the cases let me go ahead and say it fits all the cases that i've used that i normally carry my apple pencil with so just keep that in mind you're going to be able to carry this it's not going to charge up top because you got to charge it through usb type-c but when you get done with that you charge it up you get an all-day battery i have not had this thing to dial me as of yet um pretty nice little device doesn't have a whole lot of weight to it and when you're using it i mean it really really feels like you're writing with your apple pencil now just keep in mind you do have palm recognition i'm laying my hand on the screen i'm laying my finger on the screen it's still working there are no issues like i said you get the actual writing experience and you get a shade or a tilt to shade and you see my fingers still over here on the screen so you still get that precision uh pressure sensitivity i don't really use the pressure sensitivity because i'm mainly writing with the same pressure but as far as your pressure sensitivity goes the average person doesn't really use it uh and and like i say it if you want to make it darker just you know draw it a little bit more i i don't really have an issue out of this and i'm not an artist i just doodle from time to time and the way this feels like with the tilt and the lines and everything else the drawing experience the writing experience is very fluid very neat and like i would have to say this is probably one of the top five stylus that i have seen and the color of it i mean just the gray with the black the matte finish i mean i love it i like it a lot and i really haven't used my apple pencil in about a week to tell the truth i've been using this thing and zag bravo you did a good job with this one my hat's off to you so there we go this is the zag pro stylus now i'm gonna go ahead and give my disclaimer right here right now because somebody's going to say will this work with the ipad mini will this work with the 9.7 will this work with the ipad version that came out two years ago and the answer is going to be yes yes and yes any apple ipad where you can use an apple pencil gen 1 or gen 2 this thing will work just keep that in mind any of those this will work so it's a great device to have it's going to cost you is half the price of an apple pencil and sticks to the top magnetically you couldn't ask for a whole lot more so i'll be sure

is your stylus and you have to use it like in this way if you want to remove it you can just go like this [Music] and if you want to use it again you just put it like this and use your any headphone or touch ipad [Music] i will tell you how you can do [Music] this [Music] and this is your extra tip which we are giving you if this is this will break you can use this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys welcome today we're actually going to be unboxing the brand new surface pen if you do end up buying one of these and you're curious as to what you will get inside the box let's just open that up and you have this gorgeous black colored surface pen this attaches magnetically to the tablet on one side there you go it's attached within the box itself furthermore you have again paperwork this is going to probably be usage manuals how to use this how to charge it maintenance guide and a piece of warranty instructions so what is the warranty liability like etc etc so that's it so this is most of us won't ever read this but that's all right uh in terms of the stuff that you will actually use and stuff that you should actually be concerned with this is all you get so that's it that's a quick look at the unboxing of the surface pen thank you guys for watching and i'm gonna see you in the next one you", "NLsLbykhMU0": "[Music] hello guys james here and this is tech mno in this quick video i will share with you my experience on the apple pencil alternative from gujarat that i bought last month online is this a perfect alternative to the original apple pencil and is it worth it well we will find out in this gujutak active stylus span review [Music] before we begin i would appreciate if you go like comment and click that subscribe button with the notification bell so that you will never miss a brand new upload from me and watch the entire review because at any point in this video i will give you more details about our updated and upgraded road to 1k subs giveaway so stick around the package came in a simple white box and inside of it has a usbc cable for charging a pencil holder that looks like a fall leather manuals an extra pencil tip and the stylus fan aka the pencil itself the one i got here is a black pencil in a concave design that looks like the apple pencil too it comes also in a round shape and magnetic concave configurations available colors here are black white pastel pink and pastel green but the availability of it will depend on the design you will choose the design of the stylus really looks like the apple pencil but there's a cutout of the charging port which is usb type-c and has a touch sensitive button on top also if you get the magnetic concave design it doesn't have the magnetic charge feature too so you can charge it on the side if you have the ipad pro the weight of it feels the same as the apple pencil one and two so if you have the original pencil you'll get the hang of it the performance of the gujutak active stylus pen in my almost two months of using it is good the palm rejection feature is working properly and it can detect some of the pressure sensitivity i do on the pen when i use it on my workflow like editing videos on lumo fusion my one major complaint on this product is the bottleneck on top it's ultra sensitive to the point that you will have an accidental press if you draw or write in an angled position i wish the button had a double press to close because this can be annoying to some people that use it on a cursive or angle drawing i would also suggest if you're a graphic artist or you're the person who draws every time on your ipad to use a plastic screen protector and not a tempered glass in my experience i always get inconsistent or jagged results that i will show right here [Music] the pen will last for about five to six hours if you will use it straight and it can be fully charged via the usb-c port for about two hours and there's an led indicator also so now the question is is this a great alternative to the original apple pencil and is it worth its price at around 995 to 1010 pesos or around 20 dollars depending on the shape and color you will buy this stylus fed from gujarat is a great alternative if you're a graphic designer slash artist a person who likes to draw on your ipads or you just want to have an option if you don't want to use your fingers on some tasks like editing videos without breaking your back just a quick reminder that the stylus man will only work on some ipads that have apple pencil support so if you want to know if your device is compatible i will post the chart that goes your dock is provided you will also see the device model number at the back of your ipads and before we wrap up the video i will announce the details of our update giveaway as mentioned early in the video as we are approaching 1 000 youtube subscribers i

scribbling sketching or whatever you need to do we'll be using paper new iPad app to test out these styli which we found reproduces marks pretty nicely and is a good judge of character for these styli first category we're going to launch into is the most populous category of style.i which is the rubber tipped group the 24.95 value pen is by far the most distinctive looking stylus with a round tip and it looks like one big chunk of aluminum feels really nice in your hand it's weighted well and there are no seams at all it is a hexagonal prism which means it kind of looks like the old Dixon Ticonderoga pencil you used to use in school the tip is really nice except for the fact that it kind of drags across the screen as you use it which is unlike some of the other round tips styli i used but maybe it's just because i haven't warned it in that much the $29.99 bamboo by Wacom is highlighted by 53 and it's promotional videos for paper for a reason because it's one of the best styler you can buy for your iPad it's expensive but it's exceptionally well rounded as a stylus it has a removable pen clip it has a removable tip it's a very nice length it has a great weight from back to front and overall it just works very well it is a smaller diameter rubber tip and some of the other rubber tips style I tested and I actually like it better because it allows you to be more precise when you're writing or drawing next up is the Amazon basic stylus which is exactly as it sounds it's a basic stylus that you can buy from Amazon it's the cheapest on our list its eleven dollars and there's really not much to it it is a nice enough tip and it's black plastic body with chrome accents and there's a little annoying lanyard on the end of it which we would just rather not have but besides that it's pretty decent we would actually expect this to be a little bit cheaper from Amazon considering what it is but it's nice to throw in your pocket it's cheap you won't care if you lose it and it works well enough the 1999 stylus from Griffin is really just like the Amazon basic stylus but twice the price there is a dingy little pen clip on here that's removable but the build quality of the stylus as a whole isn't very good and considering it's 20 bucks there's no reason to buy it the $15 kensington virtuoso stylus pen combo is a great deal it's a lot like the Amazon in terms of performance and the tip but it's longer it has a soft touch rubber coating and when you pop off the cap it actually exposes a pen so it's a really nice deal for 15 dollars especially considering the build quality is good and there's a nice ball clip to attach it to your pocket the Kensington is perfect for a businessman with tablet it's just the same length as the ballpoint pen you're accustomed to using the qlh 10 at 1295 is also a great deal and at half the size it has a textured grip that I like and the tip is the real standout feature here because it's about the same diameter as the bamboo except it actually has a little nib inside of it so that when you press it down on the screen you can actually feel the stylus making contact with the screen I've read a few places that after a couple weeks the tip can degrade down a little bit but from my experience it worked very well another key feature is the top that comes off and the top is attached to a little string that's attached to a little plastic dongle that you can plug into the headphone jack of your iPhone or iPad next is a brief pitstop in the lonely foam tip stylist category Pogo sketch plus is a relic of the old days where styli were ugly and metallic and thin and uncomfortable to hold and the Pogo sketch plus is no different the tip is made of a conductive foam that you could buy at the local RadioShack and it's kind of glued to the tip here in such a way that it's mushes down when you use it and it just isn't very responsive and isn't very comfortable to use and it just doesn't evoke and sense of quality it does have a pen clips you can hold on to it but at $15 it's not a great deal doesn't stand out in any way and it's the only stylus with a foam tip which is not good in stark contrast is the studio neat cosmonaut which is a big dry erase marker typed stylus that uses the same rubber tip as the first category but this time the rubber tip is embedded which means there's nothing to poke or lose or smush down and the cosmonaut has a great tip because of that it doesn't compress as much as any of the ones in the first category cosmonaut is very overt about its capabilities as a stylus it's not trying to do too much it's not trying to let you write in cursive on your screen it's really just for sketching doing some casual drawing writing diagramming it's really great for kids adults the elderly it's super easy to use it's kind of like an extension of your finger and it's kind of a no-brainer and it's really durable so nothing's going to happen to this thing it's twenty-five dollars which isn't cheap isn't expensive but it's really category unto its own and finally we have the Adhan it Jack Pro the jot Pro by Adonit is unlike any other stylus on the market it really doesn't look much like a stylus it looks more like a tool an architect would use it's really just this long piece of aluminum with a soft touch rubber grip that culminates in this pointy end and the end touches this little plastic disc that somehow conducts electricity through the screen and because it's a clear plastic disc you can actually see more precisely than any other stylus where you're writing so I think this is the most precise stylus you can get but the plastic discs are fragile they're going to cost you eight dollars for a pair of two of them to replace it and it's you know it looks fragile but it looks very sturdy one other cool thing about the jot Pro is that it uses magnets just like your smart cover to attach to the side of your iPad and stay there so your jot doesn't roll off the table or if you just want to put your iPad under your arm and walk around with the jot Pro attached to it and it's cool it's generally pretty reliable it doesn't fall off and even if you have a smart cover on it will generally stay put one thing to note about the jot Pro is that it's really not great for sketching simply because when you're sketching you're picking up your pen you're putting it down very quickly and because the jot Pro connects with your screen a little piece of plastic there's actually an audible tapping almost like you're tapping your fingernail on the screen every time you pick up and put down the stylus to sum it up none of these styli are perfect I wouldn't even say any of them are stellar because the fact is it's just not that pleasurable of an experience to be writing on a piece of glass no matter what instrument you're using that's why this is designed with your finger in mind because that's really the only thing that feels natural on the screen but if you want to do some note-taking or drawing there are some pretty great options so our all-around winner is the Wacom Bamboo with its understated modern look and it really hits all the right points no matter what you're doing but there are some options that excel in other categories so if you're doing mostly writing which I'm not really sure why you'd want to be doing a ton of writing on your iPad but if you are jot Pro is unbeatable because it is the most precise and it will mark the screen almost exactly where you think it's going to as far as diagramming or writing some flashcards or notes the cosmonaut is very easy to use it feels nice in your hand and just about anybody can pick it up and use it it's also just good for browsing your iPad as far as quick scribbling goes the SGP Kuehl h10 at under $15 is just about perfect you're not going to be doing any extended drawing or scribbling or note-taking on there but considering it attaches to the headphone jack on your iPhone or iPad you won't lose it it's small tip is nice and the textured grip means you won't drop it you", "eh8E8Ec6zMM": "hi friends talks here I got something super cool for you today this is a act of stylist okay this is available on Amazon and I will have a link for you in the description right below so be sure and click that link but this is meant for iPads Samsung tablets or any type of device that

graphic design they don't just use you any old stylus no no no they use a good special professional stylist so that's what we have here tell you guys looking at the fact there is a little bar code for you and if you need that there you go you can pause but again the link for you will be right below okay let's go ahead and open this up we got a little tab here let me see if I can do this gracefully I think I hate wrecking beautiful boxes and this is a really nice looking white box like I'm digging the design of this whole thing so very cool let's see if we can do this gracefully okay we're gonna go ahead and pull this open here I think I got the temp pushed back enough and I think inside there's a little plastic tray as you can see it's out keep your stylus nice and protected there we go oh that's really cool-looking I'm diggin the white looks like you have some little instructions and things here too let's take a look at that accessories first one lay this down here we do have a little Amazon card here thank you for buying that item and if you have any comments or feedback how to reach the seller which is really nice so very cool back to the side we do have a little cord it comes with a USB cord that's a standard USB and this is like your similar micro USB this is what you find out like a lot of Samsung phones you probably have a lot of devices around your house that use the same kind of computer USB to a like a regular cell phone older style USB our brother shouldn't say older it's someone which a lot of the galaxy's use and a lot of cell phones use so you probably already have a lot of plugs like this somewhere in your house right now okay and then we do have a little instruction manual here we'll check this out and this is again the two-in-one multifunctional I'm stylist okay so very cool we have a few different languages so let me see if I have English oh there we go English okay very cool before I used to be sure to read the manual introduction just talk about some different elements of it it is a one point five millimeter fine point okay so I should draw right navigate with incredible accuracy so this can be really good for doing artwork or maybe signing to gel checks things of that nature to signing your signature on screen very cool okay this have an aluminum body which will probably better construction and longer shelf life which is really good a pocket clip so you can clip it in your pocket very cool on-off switch which is number four which is that little button a very familiar-looking but until you guys I'm sure I'm very soft tip which is cool right there on the end well soft touch magnetic cap that's interesting okay and this is combined with a number of touch turning devices so you can use it with anything that except a one point five millimeter fine point which is pretty much all electronic devices like touchscreens like iPads and Samsung notes and things of that nature okay just have some important things look look you and I here and if you guys have any questions reach out to member I can read this whole thing but um you get the gist of it I'm telling you what I have an iPad over here let's go ahead and try this bad boy out now a surprise here actually greeted by something very cool I didn't realize I came with a cool little bag it has like a little fell tea bag to keep your pen in to keep it super nice as a little drawstring here for a shiny cool you can cinch it up and keep your electronic pen very very cool so that's really a nice touch I didn't expect that so kudos this is appreciated guys and then here's the pen stuff we'll go ahead and pull this out how's you gonna my weight to it it feels you know not overly heavy but it's not light it feels like a quality digital stylus so very cool the end here is soft this is kind of like a nylon eco material very soft nice little clip silver power button right there press the power button and then of course oh you see it lights up often times electronics aren't charged when you get them so it's kind of cool stuff she does have a charge you see a little blue ring around there very cool and I course dapeng and that's the electric pine this is pushed back it has a little springiness to it so very cool I'm definitely digging this now drawing really couldn't be simpler all you have to do is make sure the pen light is on okay that means that it's ready to go and if it's not on them you know plug it in and charge it if it need be now if you did need a charge I guess I should add the way it charges you move the cap right there and right there it's when the cable the cable just goes right into little right there just like that so very simple and then you plug in the USB to any charging device so couldn't be simpler definitely hold onto the cable and the capitis goes right and this is kind of magnetic - so this guy's snaps in place but once your pen is charged okay then you're ready to go and out so you hit the button make sure you got the blue ring and then this just works like your finger essentially with much more accuracy so you can go ahead and draw as you can see we could do some colors I'll make a little smiley face here very cool maybe I draw a little heart so a lot of fun I could definitely go and spend more time drawing something different but I just wanted to give you the basics here just so you know that it really does work and it works it's very responsive it actually works really good so I'm really impressed with this I definitely recommend this for anyone who's a wannabe artist or just learned graphic design it can be definitely a lot of fun up we gotta get a pen here we'll do a pencil and I'll do this color here and you say you can see now you can make this different widths and this is this one hour program I found randomly on the iTunes Store I mean it works with any kind of number of programs that work with the iPad okay to recap this is the active stylus sold by evac Evie ACH hope I got that right the link for you that will be in the description right down below so click that link to get your own this is definitely way of upping the game you play with as far as artwork goes an akai stylus related thing on a ipad samsung tablet a phone that uses a pen you know like a note from samsung there's a lot of devices and besides just drawing and having fun drawing and stuff it's really great because you can actually play some games with this - there's a lot of traceable games like even the Harry Potter game from the antic there's a lot of games that involve like tracing a design or something so a kind of thing which could make use of a pen this can be so helpful so I really recommend this is stuff that will give you some accuracy to your drawing and it's really

at gmail.com and we'll talk to you soon okay all right bye-bye [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "_4W1sHGJw3A": "you guys welcome back to another video today we're gonna be looking at a professional stylist pin so I got this on Amazon and this is the box that comes in it's pretty thin and the company name is Iran stylist pin I guess model number and it is white we'll see what this thing has to offer so let's open it up it looks like it just slides up from here alright so it looks like we have a thank you card here so and if you subscribe to their Facebook you get 50% off on the next purchase very interesting and if you're unhappy about something you can contact them here alright so here on the top we have a user manual so a pretty simple manual not too complicated so it looks like here we also have a pouch for the pen very nice and it's like a leather type material and it's white it looks very attractive actually so also a glove what it looks like to be okay so it's like a two finger glove there that you can use I guess if you need this alright so it looks like we have a charging cable here looks like micro USB to USB and it's about a foot long and here we can see the pin itself and there looks to be another piece to it here let's go ahead and pull the pin out and that's everything for the box so here we can see the pit a little closer it looks very nice so it does have an interesting tip there and it's quite long we do have a little conventional clip here so you can clip that and there looks to be a button right here on the side I guess that's to turn it on and here on the top there is a cover then it comes right off and this is where we're going to plug in our USB charger very interesting I like how they made the cutout or you could easily see you would side up of the micro USB cable that goes up now I don't understand completely how this thing works but when you power it on the capacitive part of the pin starts to work and that's how it operates it doesn't need to connect to the device so it technically works like your finger but a lot more precise I guess so to turn it on I think all we got to do is press this little button here and you can see that guys but there's a blue light there and I'm guessing that means it's on ready to go and to turn it off just click it again just like that so it's as simple as that now if you don't use the pin for 30 minutes it goes to auto shut down and shuts itself down and here in the manual it says that it will last continuously up to five days under full charge so that's pretty cool so that should last quite a while all right so let's give this thing a little test run so I got an iPad here let's go ahead and just go to notes so we're gonna try this pen out here I'm gonna click over here well let's go ahead and use the pin so I'm going to turn it on it's glowing blue so we're gonna go ahead and click on the pen option here I'm not sure oh so I guess let's let's go with the thinnest one obviously I'm probably the worst person to draw anything but let's see if I can write some letters okay so my aunt's kind of like everywhere but I think there's an app that you can download that you will be able to draw and things like that on but it seems to be very precise if you can keep it precise like if I can go really fast and draw a circle that's definitely nice and thin and you can see it's very responsible its immediate so this would work very good for like a drawing app or things like that so but you can see you guys how long this pit is if I'm holding in my hand it's quite long see how this other end works okay so it works really good also very nice yes you can use this as an eraser if you wanted to use it as an eraser so I decided to download a coloring book so we're gonna check that out in a little bit while while that's downloading let's look at these accessories that it comes with so I'm gonna go ahead and shut the pen down here so we do have a USB charging here so the charge at USB all we gotta do is take this cap off here and then grab our cable plug it into a power source and then plug it into our pin just like that and it should start charging as you can see guys it's glowing red and that indicates that it's charging so once we're done charging it we'll just unplug it put your cap back on and by the way guys these are magnetic so they just snap right on so if you didn't want to use this one and just use the normal one snap that alright it does look a little cleaner with this normal one so and it does come with this really nice pouch which it just slides right in like that and you got yourself a nice little carrying pouch very cool so last but not least if we do have this glove I'm not sure exactly if that's how it goes but I think this is for that when you lay down on the pad itself you're not gonna engage it with your body here so you'd be able to lean on the screen while using the pen like this without disrupting the capacitance on the screen it's basically to isolate you from the screen through your body so it doesn't react with it that way only the pen will react with it alright so we got our color book thing open let's choose something from here alright so technically let's see how this works I guess it's that the option where you can just click it and it'll paint that part well that's cool that's pretty fun and you can get really precise you wouldn't be able to do this with your finger obviously so we can zoom in looks like let's see if I click here there we go pretty cool I guess this is the kind of coloring anybody can enjoy as you can see that's what we got so far so it seems like the pen does really good with the responsiveness to the screen I'm not sure exactly what motor and I've never used this app but let's say if we go to brushes here pencil marker okay pencil and here we can choose the size obviously let's go ultra-thin let's zoom into something here a little closer see we can actually use it as a pencil yeah it's definitely ultra thin guys but it seems to be very accurate overall though well you get the idea that I'm just gonna go back cuz it does not look very good so I guess using the Paint Bucket is the finest way to paint but in any case you get the point so I can stay here all day and just do this and make a nice little painting super cool pen so if you are creative and you like to draw this might be a good choice for you or even just sketching up stuff so I'm sure there's a bunch of apps that you could use to really get creative with a pin like this so overall I'd say this is pretty cool especially for what it does and if you need that precision for capacitive screen then this might be a good option here alright guys we'll hopefully enjoy this video if you did then hit

Inc enables smart stylus it's called the bamboo ink plus it can replace your current laptops pen and I've got a surface pen right here we're gonna test this out see how these things stack up the video sponsored by me on my website I'd collect all my reviews even ranked my favorite pen displays iPads tablets by size it's designed to help you find the info you need before you buy full disclosure the links I use on there are affiliate links to Amazon so if you ever find any of my reviews helpful clicking on one of those links before you buy gives a little bit of a commission from that sale back to me it all adds up and it helps me buy more gear to review you guys have been supporting this channel for years that way and I am super grateful so thank you now onto the review this stylus was provided to me about the folks over at Wacom however this is not a sponsored review so the opinions here are my own I want to put an asterisk by this review because it's not a full review it's like a partial half review I would have loved to have tested this stylus on a dozen different pcs across the board from different manufacturers but right now the only thing that I have to test this on is the surface go that I have here on my office that I write on and because of that I'm structuring this as a Wacom pen versus surface pen sort of video as opposed to a full-blown review and because of that I don't think my experiences with this pen are going to be the same that you may experience on a different device if you use this on any other surface device the surface book a surface pro surface studio etc you're probably going to experience the same exact thing that I'm experiencing however if you use this on say an HP device you may have a very different experience and I'm gonna explain why in a minute but I've got a lot of questions to answer in this review and number one is what is this thing this is what comes latest active stylus designed for Windows computers it's designed with something called the Windows universal pen framework does this mean it will work on any Windows computer no it does not it will only work on laptops and tablets that already are enabled for pens some touchscreens are only touchscreens they don't support pens at all so to oversimplify how the pen works it's not just the pen doing the but the digitizers underneath the screen of your tablet that are reading the position of the pen if you don't have those receptors underneath this screen then there is nothing that's gonna be able to read the placement of where the pen is there are primarily two digitizers out there right now the first one is called n-trig which is Microsoft's and it uses it in all of their devices and the other one is Wacom Zone AES what makes this pen special is that it has both the n-trig and the AES components inside the pen by holding down this button for a second you can switch between them and then you can draw on a different screen now before when I mentioned that your experience with this pen might be a lot different than my experience of this pen that's where this comes in if you have Wacom's aes Tec in your tablet this pen is gonna perform differently than it's going to perform my surface go which is using entry and if this all sounds really confusing don't worry you're not alone my advice is if you're interested in this make sure you go to Wacom site first and check out what devices that this thing is compatible with before you make a decision and that brings me to question 2 what does this do pen is designed for folks who want to get the most out of their Windows ink features on their computers annotating screenshots leaving notes or in the case of what I do here on this channel drawing an illustration in this pen you're gonna get pressure sensitivity that means that if you press harder on the pen tip your strokes will get darker or thicker there's also tilt support so say you have a tool in your app that acts like a pencil and you want to get the edge of that pencil for shading just tilt your stylus over and you can get that graphite shading effect you're looking for you also have access to Windows inks workspace with a single press of a button on the top of the pen another bullet point listed on the box is light touch responsiveness but we're gonna talk a little bit more about that in a minute and lastly it's USB rechargeable that's a big upgrade in this pen over the previous version which took a quadruple a battery those quadruple A batteries are cute but they cost the money in the box you're gonna find the pen itself a USB charging cable for recharging the little plastic nib holder a QuickStart guide and what is this a slow start guide no warranty legal stuff got it a pen itself ism too bad let's talk about the design it's got this ergonomic triangle design triangle is probably the wrong word it's somewhere between a circle and a triangle Trickle circle anyway you can see what I'm talking about best if you look at it from the top this shape is more and it feels good when you're holding it in your hand and has the added bonus of not really rolling around on the table too much there are two programmable buttons along the side and of course that button up along the top which activates Windows ink click the top button wants to open Windows ink workspace you double click the button to open the screen sketch and you click and hold to open a sticky note it's got a nice sharp fine tip point like you'd expect on a device like this in that little case that I mentioned it holds a couple extra nibs the nibs have different hardness so swapping out the nibs of your pen is going to give you a different drawing feel when you're using this stylus I think this is a pretty good call on walking his part because I don't really know what kind of screen you're gonna be writing on is the screen gonna be really slick glass and you might want to go with a little bit of a softer nib does have a matte finish or an anti-glare texture or coating on it that you're gonna want to go with a harder nib or something that suits your needs better the grip on the pen itself is a soft plastic soft is probably the wrong word maybe it's like a more of a matte texture a very fine Mac texture that gets the pen a good grip and along the side towards the back is a little plastic piece that you can pop out and that's where the USB cord plugs in for charging yep you guess it comes with the USB cable for that exact purpose the end that goes into the pen is one of the newer smaller USB C chargers but the end that goes into your computer is the standard sites USB port since I don't have one of the older USB ports on my surface go I had to use my own USB C port in order to charge the pen probably a good choice because standard USB ports are still more common but since this is designed for tablets with pens which tend to be the newer kind of tablets I would assume we're pretty close to the tipping point for USB C ports anyway enough about USB C pores let's get on to the nitty-gritty let's test out this pen every good pen test starts with me cleaning off my screen first things first I have two pens I have wanted the latest surface pens this one is the matte black pen that I got for my surface pro 6 review last fall and then of course I have la comes new bamboo ink plus so to start off with I'm gonna be starting with the surface pen and I'm just going to start by drawing some nice subtle lines pressing lightly and then you know getting heavier just to feel the pressure and get a feel for it now one thing that I do know on all surface devices because they're using intrigue technology under the hood is I always get some wiggle to it all of some jitter you can see it a little bit there I got a little bit more over here that's common and I expect the same thing from Wacom pen so let's undo those grab this pen let's check this out so I'm going to put my pen down and again I'm coming in here and right off the bat the very first thing I'm seeing is I'm getting more jitter and more wobble from this pen and generally that's been my experience I'm gonna pull open my settings here I just wanted to show you that right now now the bamboo ink plus is synced up via bluetooth so I do have this thing connected properly I think and working the way it should be working I'm going to increase my pen size now that I start to get a feel for it and I'm going to press very lightly and one thing that you are gonna notice with entry devices is that the initial activation force is kind of heavy if you use an Apple pencil or a Wacom device you're gonna notice right away that as soon as you just even put the tip on the canvas it is going to leave a line and this isn't necessarily going to do that you have to apply a little bit of pressure so if you're someone who's a very light sketcher and doesn't like that this is this is not something that's gonna work out really well for you and it's not just the bamboo pen it's also the surface pen in general so when I press the lightest I get something very light I apply pressure overall I feel like the pressure the pressure curve works really well here I'm getting like a good thick line once that activation kicks in I get a really thin line if I press a little little lightly so overall I feel like the pressure curve is just fine and I get the same feeling from this I feel like this kicks in a little bit sooner the pressure is about the same but I'm not getting quite as light of a line at the beginning but for the most part these two feel very similar to me next up I want to do some fast lines so let me shrink my brush size down a little bit and I'm just gonna come in here and do really fast lines just to get a feel for what's what's happening that's pretty much what I expected gonna jump to the other stylist now let's see how this does and as I was saying I I do feel a little bit of pressure difference here the surface stylist comes on stronger a little bit earlier thus I'm getting slightly thicker lines when I'm hatching whereas this is not also again I'm seeing more wave more wobble in this pen than I am in the surface pen so let's jump over to our pen tests and really start to dissect that all right so the first thing that I like to do is just take the pen and draw a slow diagonal line and just see how that is I feel some jitter in there it's not too bad I'm gonna use a ruler just to make sure I'm using a nice wooden ruler so I'm not thrown anything off here so let's take a look at a slow steady line with this pen what do we get we get a pretty uniform wave going on here which is pretty much what I expected so now let's take this pen the bamboo pen and I'm going to do the same thing I'm gonna get a good grip on it and I'm gonna just start drawing I'm gonna draw slow and again I'm getting more wave with this pen that I was getting with the standard surface pen and we're gonna come in here with my ruler gonna do the same thing angled lines and again I'm getting a pretty uniform wave going on here and so that has been my experience so far drawing with these pens is that with in trig I always feel like I'm getting some wave but I feel like I'm getting more of it on the bamboo that I'm getting with the standard surface pen so the big question here is is this worth buying and I have to say no I really like what Wacom does I love welcomes products I think Wacom makes some of the best pens and pendous blades on the market right now but as you saw there the surface pro pen just performs better than this does and they both cost about a dollars now if this was considerably cheaper like 3040 dollars cheaper I could say yeah if you're using it for handwriting taking notes and basically Windows Inc type functions go ahead save the money get the cheaper pen the surface pen has the added benefit of being designed specifically for the surface device you're using it's magnetized so it sticks to the side of your surface like a boss I think this pen welcomes new pen its best attribute is also its biggest weakness and that is is you have two pens in one pen you you have basically taken the guts from an intrigue pen and stuck it in here and the guts from Wacom zome AES pen and you put it in the same place but most people they only have one computer they're using they don't necessarily need a pen that functions on two different kinds of tablets and since you're putting more technology into the pen that's gonna drive up the price and I can't find a way to really justify saying this works better I mean on one end this button is already calibrated to work with Windows ink but if you're talking about the surface pen you can actually just go in and customize it to do the same exact thing I think the reason this exists is the Wacom can go to consumers and say hey if you buy this pen you know it's gonna work on whatever Windows PC you have but right now you can buy a Windows PC that doesn't support any pens or you can buy a Windows PC that doesn't have touch at all so overall probably not a bad idea but also probably not the best fit for artists and illustrators thank you guys for watching check out some of my other surface reviews over here on this side of the screen if you have any comments or questions let me know down below it's all I've got I'll see you in a couple of days", "gfwwA854NFM": "hi there I'm Harry from kittens a first look video into the term one precision stylus and I'm just going to discuss and give a short demonstration this product this is a whole new generation of stylus moving away from the common thick rubber tip to the new ultra slim precision design which sets a whole new level of packard drawing and writing the position tip is just that precision providing pinpoint accuracy and incredible detail the plastic cap on the tip provides protection from scratch on the screen of your device the stylus comes with a ballpoint pen making this stylus an all-in-one solution in the office at home or on-the-go so when using the stash you can really feel a level of detail as well as comfort the rubber pad along the end provides grip and support for your fingers even when using the ballpoint pen so the pen is not too light and not too heavy providing even balance and that premium quality feel so the pen comes with two caps one which you can go onto the ballpoint pen and another you can go along with a business stylus but you can both attach it to one side so you never lose them you can also replace the cartridge just check the back of the packaging for more details so it comes in a variety of different colors as well as presented in a strong metal finish so look out for more first look videos and thank you for watching", "kQV29dCKzc8": "hi everyone welcome to this unboxing and review of the samsung s pen galaxy tab s6 lite it's a pen normally dedicated to the samsung s6 lite tablet but which uses wacom emr technology and therefore compatible with many ink note-taker devices it is a stylus that comes in three colors gray pink and blue i choose a grey model let's discover the contents of the box so we should find the pen two replacement nibs one tweezer and the reflector the pen is designed by samsung and made in china here is open box the leaflet don't have any interest the declaration of conformity in several languages so we find the stylus itself more of an antracid black color rather than grey the nib is protected by a small paper cap so a rather long scene a very light stylus and a soft plastic material it is thermoplastic polyurethane a round design with a flat part and so a side button that is configurable on the samsung tablet but will also serve as an eraser for eating tablets that support it the grip is quite pleasant very fine the plastic is soft the stylus that is quite long but rather sober and elegant just a small precision the photo of the box is not at scale that's it for the stylus so we also find in the box two spare nibs and the small metal tweezers that allows you to easily remove the nib from the stylus two replacement nails one white and one black but for me no difference except the color and that's it for the contents of the box now a very important precision that could make you decide to choose this stylus or another i took the unix knot air and the remarkable 2 which have the particularity of having magnetic pants that can be fixed on the side of the tablet while the samsung stylus is also magnetic here the box pen with its rather light magnetization and the remarkable 2 and the marker plus which holds much more solidly you just have to find the right place just there more on the top of the tablet in fact let's try it with the samsung stylus and you can see that it holds quite really well on the not the magnetization is less powerful but as the samsung is lighter it works quite well too better than with the original styles in fact the cover also helps a lot to maintain it is less effective directly on the bare device a few measures for the stylus so light weight of 7 grams for a length of 14 and a half centimeters and therefore a very fine stylus with a diameter of with between 7.1 and 7.7 millimeters variable because of the flatness that is present along the entire length of the stylus visual comparison with other stylus smaller stylus we have the staedtler jumbo the classic onyx boot stylus and the lamy when the cap is removed and for those who are taller we will have the wacom one the books pen from the note air the remarkable marker plus and the hp zbook x2 here is in the order of sizes for the sales that i can have at the moment small exercise to change the samsung nib and compatibility with other nibs we have to use a small tweezer provided to remove the nib and then change it for for example by the hp white one and now some writing tests i will let you listen to the sun produced first on the remarkable two a pleasant touch a little friction with the original nib it does not slip too much erase button on the side which falls well and there's a finger but which is not supported here by the remarkable c good management of the pressure we don't need to press or hold back too much the gesture compare with the marker plus i think that you can hear a lot more friction totally different with the staedtler or jumbo where it glides much more it's still very precise and now with the lamy also very slippery and but always a good precision lay me for which it is necessary to press a little more when writing so a samsung quite comfortable on the remarkable tool let's try now on the onyx box not air on a more slippery surface so an intermediate friction i would say here the button on the side works perfectly surprisingly better accuracy with the samsung than with the supplied bookspan and for example here a wacom one that i found even better okay the lamy very precise a more pronounced gliding sensation almost no friction sound and finally the staedtler jumbo very pleasant but here less comfortable in the precision exercise end of the review for the samsung s-pen galaxy s6 lite if you liked please like and subscribe you can of course go and see the other stylus tests i've done see you soon on the channel [Music] you", "BvWQMC4nJe8": "Do you really need an Apple Pencil? Up until now I've always said, \"Yes.\" Don't even think about it, the Apple Pencil is hands down the best stylus for the iPad. But, maybe I've changed my mind! I've recently bought this Logitech Crayon and yes, I bought this with my own money because I was super curious\nto find out how this works. And I've seen it recommended a few times, and also Apple actually sells\nthis stylus on their website. So I thought, well, if Apple sells it, maybe it's not that bad. But, is it the Apple Pencil killer? Well, that's what we're\ngonna find out in this video. And while we're looking at\nthese different stylus pens, I've actually also got\na Wacom Bamboo Stylus that I'm gonna show you\nas well, because why not? The purpose of this video is to review all of these stylus pens to see what they are good for, what they might struggle with, so you can make an informed decision about which ones of these stylus pens you wanna buy for yourself. So I've made this scoring sheet and our test each of these stylus pens according to their suitability for taking notes, for\ncalligraphy, for creating art, and then I'll give it an\noverall score as well. We're going to start with the\n1st generation Apple Pencil, because it's my 1st true love when it comes to stylus pens for the iPad. I will never forget the 1st time I held this baby in my hands, it\nreally felt like true magic. If you end up deciding that\nyou want an Apple Pencil, you need to make sure\nthat you check the device, that you have to make sure that you get the right Apple Pencil for your device. The 1st generation,\nApple Pencil only works with a selection of iPads. And I'm going to put\nthe compatible devices on the screen here for you. I have two of these devices right here, and I'm going to do the\ntest with that 6th gen iPad, which is the one that\ncame out in early 2018. And then to perform the test, we're going to use that Procreate app and I've made eight scoring sheet here that you can see that's\ngot four quadrants, one for each stylus pen, so we can really compare\nApples with Apples. I've also made a stylus test brush set so we can use the same brushes\nwith all the stylus pens to see how they perform. So the 1st test we are going to do is to test out the ability to take notes. And this is pretty straightforward, what we're gonna do is\nwrite that name of the pen that we're testing out right here. So this is the Apple Pencil 1, and as you can see, as expect that this performs really well, this is really responsive, and so of course, this is\na very nice experience. Even on an older iPad, this\nstill really works well. And now to demonstrate the suitability for lettering and calligraphy, let's select the brush\nthat is precious sensitive. So this brush here is not\nonly pressure sensitive, but it also changes\ncolor with that pressure that you put on the iPad. So if I'm putting more pressure on, you can see how it changes the color, and you can see how this creates this super nice transition between the thick and the thin strokes, but also there are\ndifferent pressures as well. And then we always are\ngonna try a painting brush. And so just gonna try\npainting a little petal here and as expect this works\nreally, really nicely. Next up, we have that 2nd\ngeneration Apple pencil, and this is compatible with that 3rd and 4th\ngeneration 12.9 inch iPad Pros, and also with the 1st and 2nd generation 11 inch iPad Pros. The iPad that I have here is the 4th generation 12.9 inch iPad Pro. The big difference of course, is that you can charge the\nApple Pencil on the iPad, and it also sticks to the iPad like that, which is super handy. It has really made a huge difference in my enjoyment to using the Apple Pencil. It's always charged and\nit's always ready to go. Using this Apple Pencil\nwith more than one iPad is actually not too bad either because all they have to do\nis put it on top of your iPad and then you can see it\nconnects automatically, so this is very, very\nfast and easy as well. In terms of performance and usability, the 2nd generation Apple Pencil is actually pretty much\nidentical to the 1st generation and of course, it performs\nexceptionally well. It's ever so slightly more responsive than the Apple Pencil 1 that I've tried on the previous iPad. So now we are also going to try out the ability to create\nlettering and calligraphy, and of course, as\nexpected this Apple pencil performs extremely well. So now let's do some painting as well. And this works really, really nicely. It's ever so slightly more sensitive than that 1st generation Apple Pencil, but it's not something\nthat you would notice on it daily basis, I don't think. So now we have a really good baseline, so now we know what the Apple Pencil does. So now let's have a look\nat that Logitech Crayon. This stylus works with\nall iPads that came out in 2018 or later. So it works with my 6th gen, 2018 iPad, but it doesn't work with that 2nd generation,\n12.9 inch iPad Pro, which I find a little bit disappointing. I've tried it out and it doesn't work. So now for the test, we're\ngoing to use the 6th gen iPad, because I think it'll be more likely that you have one of these iPads when deciding whether or not you wanna get the Logitech Crayon. We're going to start with\nthat note taking ability, and I'm actually quite\nhappy with the performance of this stylus pen. It's very precise and it's very fast. So for note taking this stylus\nactually works really nicely. One of the things to note is that the stylus pen has\na slightly different shape. It looks more like a carpenter pencil, and I'm personally not\na big fan of the shape, but having said that it\ndoesn't feel too bad. It's still nice to hold, and I don't think it\nwould bother me too much. All right, so now let's change the brush, let's do some calligraphy now. And this is where the problem\nstarts with this stylus because it's not pressure\nsensitive of course, you won't be able to take advantage of the pressure sensitivity\nof that Procreate brushes. And of course, personally, for me self, this is a big no, no, so I wouldn't enjoy using this pencil because of I very much rely\non their precious sensitivity of my brushes. Right, so now lets do\na painting test as well and see how it works, if we wanna do some painting\nor just being a bit creative, maybe do some illustrations. And this is not too bad,\nit's quite responsive, but you'll see that, unfortunately, because it doesn't support\npressure sensitivity the opacity setting off this brush is getting affected as well. So it's not just about\ncreating thick or thin strokes, it's also about different\nopacity settings, and that's where you really noticed the benefit of having the Apple Pencil. It's much easier to achieve\nthe difference in opacity. So with this pencil here, you'd have to decrease the\nopacity to create lighter strokes and then change it back. So it is possible, but\nit's just not as nice as with the Appel Pencil. And then we also go in to try out the Wacom Bamboo Fineline Stylus. And I'm gonna show you how this works on the 6th gen iPad, but\nthen also on the iPad Pro because it's a little bit different. It's not officially\nsupported by Procreate, but I just wanna show you how those works as well on both iPad. So we're going to start\nwith the 6th gen iPad, and we're just gonna test out\nthe note taking capabilities, and you can already\nsee, this is not ideal. This does not work really well, and the palm rejection\ndoesn't work properly. So for that 6th gen iPad, this stylus pen doesn't work that nicely. Let's also try out their calligraphy brush to see how this works. This is meant to be pressure sensitive, but as you can see it work that\nnicely on the 6th gen iPad. And now let's try it on the iPad Pro and I'm gonna show you how it works here. It's still not great, but\nit's definitely much better than on that 6th gen iPad. So for note taking on the iPad Pro this stylus is not too bad. It doesn't create too many wobbly lines, but it has quite a bit of lag. So now let's try the ability to create lettering and calligraphy. So this stylus pen provides\nprecious sensitivity, and you can see here now we can create that thick and that thin lines and now let's try that letter as well. And then we also gonna try one of that painting brushes with this. And for painting this\nstylus is not too bad because it's got the pressure sensitivity, which means it also changes\nthe opacity in the brushes. All right, so now that we've\ntested all of the stylus pens, it's time to rate them. I'm going to rate each stylus pens for all these categories on\na scale from one to five, five is the top mark, and\nthen one is the bottom mark. So let's go through them all. So do 1st generation Apple Pencil, will get a five in these categories. I still absolutely love the\n1st generation Apple Pencil. And then overall it only gets a four, and the reason why it only gets a four is because of this thing here, it doesn't charge on the iPad itself. And I've always found\nthis a bit frustrating having to charge the\nPencil either in the iPad or have external charger. So I didn't like this so much, and that's why it doesn't\nget a five overall. All right, and then we\nalso have price here and I'm actually gonna cross this out. I'm actually not gonna\nlook at the price so much because I don't think\nit's a fair comparison, but I'm going to write value here instead. So really what we wanna do here is look at value for money when it comes to these stylus pens. And the Apple Pencil 1,\ntherefore gets a five. I think it's accepted\nwell value for money. It's been my absolute number\none favorite Apple device of all the devices I have. It's changed my mind,\nso it's absolutely worth that price for me. Alright, so this will give the Apple Pencil 1 a score of 24. And then we're gonna go up to the 2nd generation Apple Pencil. And of course, this will\nget fives here as well. This is really not that much different from the 1st generation Apple Pencil. Overall, I'm going to give\nthis stylus a five as well. Having the ability to charge\nit here on top of the iPad, and also having this attached to the iPad at\nall times is amazing. This is really what I wanted, and so no questions here\nis gonna get a five. Then when it comes to value for money, I'm not going to give this stylus a five because you can see this\nis $30 more expensive than the 1st generation Apple Pencil. And even though it's got a little bit of extra functionality, I don't think Apple needed to\nmake this $30 more expensive. I think the reason why\nthey made it more expensive is just because they could, because they knew people\nwouldn't mind paying an extra $30 for this extra functionality. In my mind, I don't think\nit's fair, so sorry. You won't get a five here, but I still think it's\nexceptional value for money, so we'll give it a four. And then we'll give this Apple\nPencil a score of 24 as well. And then that Logitech Crayon. I was skeptical when I 1st got it, but I was very, very impressed with the ability to take notes\nwith that Logitech Crayon, so it will give her the five here as well. And then, because it doesn't\nsupport pressure sensitivity, it's not really suitable for calligraphy, so it's gonna get a one. Now, when you create art, it really depends on the type\nof artwork that you create. If you rely on opacity changes\nin your Procreate brushes then I don't recommend\nthat Logitech Crayon, but if you do mostly solid\nillustrations or line up or any type of drawings where you don't need pressure sensitivity then the Logitech Crayon is\ndefinitely a good choice. So I'm going to give it a three here. And then overall, I'm going to give this\nstylus pen a three as well. I'm going to deduct some points because one of the problems\nI see with this stylus is that that charging. So it's got a charging port here, but it doesn't come with a charging cable, and I think that's fairly disappointing. This stylus pin is $70. This is actually a lightning\ncable connector, this not USB, and I find that very disappointing, especially if you wanna buy the stylus for one of the new iPad, which has a USB-C charging\nport and not a lightning port, then you will need an extra cable. And this is also the reason why\nI'm only gonna give it a two in that value for money category, because this stylus pen is $70, it's not that much cheaper\nthan the Apple Pencil, it doesn't come with a charging cable, it has no pressure sensitivity, so I really don't think this\nis good value for money. So the Logitech Crayon\nends up with 14 points. And last but not least we have the Wacom Bamboo\nFineline Stylus pen. Now, when it comes to taking notes, I did not enjoy using\nthis stylus pen at all, it crates, wobbly lines,\nand it's unpredictable, it doesn't support palm rejection. So unfortunately I'm only\ngonna give it a one here. But then when it comes to calligraphy, because it does support\npressure sensitivity, I'm gonna give it a\nthree, it's not perfect, again, it doesn't have palm rejection, which makes it a little\nbit more difficult, it's not practical. Then for creating art, I'm gonna give it a three as well, again, same reason as\nwith the calligraphy. Overall this stylus pen\nis going to get a two. It's not officially supported and I'm not sure whether this is going to be working going forward, so I would be hesitant to\nrecommend this stylus pen. And then when it comes to value for money, I'm going to give it a three. It's quite a bit cheaper than\nthe Apple Pencil, but still it doesn't have all the\nfunctionality Apple Pencil has. And I really find it lacks precision, which is quite important to me, and therefore we'll give it a three. So the Wacom Bamboo Stylus\nPen ends up with 12 points. And now it's quite obvious to see that the Apple Pencil 1\nand the Apple Pencil 2 are the clear winners in my test, which means I haven't\nreally changed my mind. I still really recommend that you get an Apple Pencil if you can, But now you have the option, so there are some alternatives if you really don't want\nto get an Apple Pencil. But the amount of happiness and joy I get out of this device really, really makes it worth it for me. I really hope you found this video useful, Give me a thumbs up if you\nlike it, leave a comment, subscribe to my channel\nif you haven't already. And then I'm also going\nto bloop up another video where I do a stylus pen review but for the phone, not for the iPad. So if you're interested in\na stylus for your phone, definitely that video as well. Thank you so much watching and I'll see you in the next video. (soft music)", "NvrS_VvLXgU": "[Music] welcome to touch technology review - how many be taking a look at the brand new surface pen which was released in June 2017 this is a significantly updated and improved version of the original surface pen and it's now available in four new colors from the burgundy black platinum and also cobalt blue I'm going to be unboxing the Platinum model today I'm gonna take a look at how it performs with a number of software applications including sketchball which is a free sketching application you can download from the Windows Store I'm also going to try it out on adobe illustrator and Photoshop and also some markup on some webpages and Word documents so there's going to be interesting to see how the forms in terms of what's changed with the brand new surface pen it now includes much greater sensitivity it boasts up to 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity which gives you more control over the width of your lines and also the intensity which is going to be well-suited to artists and illustrators it also has lower latency which makes it feel more lifelike and realistic as though you're really writing with a pen or a pencil it also now supports tilt detection which once again is going to make it very well-suited to artists and illustrators let's unbox it and take a look at what you get inside in terms of the packaging it's pretty much what you expect from Microsoft products very similar to the surface pro range matte white austere packaging as I open it up and take the pen out it feels very lightweight it's about 30 grams very similar way to the previous pen underneath it is the instruction manual and the warranty form not that you really need an instruction manual for this pen everything is very straightforward comes with a quadruple a battery and this is purported to have a lifespan of about one year before it needs replacing depending on how much you use your surface pen it kind of surprised me as I expected it may have been a rechargeable battery but it's not the case it's a perishable quadruple a battery which you can purchase online for about five dollars when you need to replace it the other thing to point out in terms of the appearance of the pen it has a slightly refined shape compared to the previous model and it has two buttons one on the side and one on the top and the other thing about it has a really strong magnet which allows it to attach on either side of your surface so they've really improved the connectivity of the pen to the surface pro on this new model so let's go ahead and check out how it performs I count to slide the surface into view now to start using the pen you simply tap on the button on top of the pen and that will open up your windows ink workspace and in that workspace you can choose notes sketches application and also you can mark up on the screen now I'm going to demonstrate the Pens sketching capability using an app called sketch of all this is a free download but you do need to upgrade it if you want to get access to all of its advanced features and it cost about $24 or there abouts now I'm going to run a couple of basic tests using the pencil and I'm just going to do some standard shapes here and what you'll notice now is that as I tilt the pen I have a different width and pressure sensitivity on my line so this is really great for illustrators they want to be able to create complex sketches or diagrams seamlessly with just one or two gestures by tilting the pen so really nice and easy to use and as you can see there's no latency everything happens in real time which is a slight improvement over the previous model which had a bit of lag and a bit of delay so it really performs well in an app like this but as I mentioned to get full access to the capabilities of this type of app you do need to download the upgraded version now let's have a look at how it performs in Illustrator I've just created a few basic shapes here and I'm just using the line tool in this example to draw a few lines and once again everything happens in real time and there's no delay so in Illustrator I use it in a very basic manner just to create basic shapes and lines and you know it really does the job as I would expect in this type of application certainly for those illustrators out there they'll be taking much more advantage of all the advanced features that illustrator has to offer and one of the main reasons I purchased the surface pen as a photographer and a digital media artist was its ability to create cutouts now I'm using the magnetic lasso tool here and as you can see the surface pen is allowing me to select my cut out really easily much easier than using a mouse and it's one of the main reasons I wanted to get the surface and have this pen to do this particular task and it's handling it really well it's cutting around the edges seamlessly intuitively and not making any mistakes or whatsoever and by the way I'm speeding this up I would normally take a little bit more time to be more accurate in a final production version but just for this demonstration purpose I'm really speeding through it and nonetheless it's created a really perfect outline for me which I'm going to be able to now copy and paste into another image so I'm going to take this subject matter and drop it into a second photo and have it appear as though it was there in the first place all done with this surface pen very easily and very intuitively so very impressed with the way it handles cutouts in Photoshop thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed

"nLNz3b6qefo": "my friends welcome back to GSP creation that is good to have you back and today we have a unboxing and review of this product this is a basis stylus pen for your capacitive touchscreen devices you could use it for your mobile phones or on your iPads or the older Android tablets this is a two in one device okay one side is a normal pin and the other side is basically the stylus this stylus is a different design if you see this closely this has this flat surface rounded surface on the edge that helps us to basically replicate the finger touch on the capacitive touchscreen devices so friends let me show you what's inside the box and quickly give you an overview and also show you some examples and we'll see how good is it to write uses for writing on the tablets or the phones so for instance of basis two-in-one capacitive touchscreen stylus so as you can see oh this is for capacitive stylus it's a double dip pens we have a normal pin and as well as stylus tip you just in the back you can see you can use it on your mobile phones and a normal notebook it's two-in-one the other sides okay let's see what we have inside okay you have to paying here so this is the basis then let's keep it aside for now and then on top you have this is an additional nib for the Pens that should be very useful it's good and I don't think you have anything else inside it's just a thank you card so that's it so the unboxing let's keep it aside and if you see this pain you have a good the logo here that piece is going on oh good decent rubber grip yeah and there's two caps so this kind of the cap puts the normal pens there you can just use it for your notebooks it's okay and on the other side is where you have our stylist okay so probably the cap is that you can't put this somewhere you can put it on the back or when your pocket so this has to be just lying around like this okay let's come to the pens so you have this soft rubber tip which is very flexible so you don't even you're writing it it can be just nice here there's a decent grip so you can keep it and then right now let's see how it is able to write with the iPad so let me use my iPad here so as you can see this pen does not require any specific connection it just starts working as a pure using your fingers to touch the screen let's try and use a Notes app to see how has writing experience here so you can select the desired size and then let's write something yeah a point to note here is this stylist is just a stylus it's not an active pen which means that you don't get a palm rejection here so you need you can't rest your palm on the screen and then write whether your palm will actually be making this impression you basically have to not touch the screen and just have loved the stylus to touch and then start writing it so as you can see friends I am able to write on the tablet using the stylus pen but at the preciseness of using a normal pen and writing on it or compared to using the active pens which we have now with latest iPads and Apple pencil all this experience is nowhere closer to using a pencil or using a Mac tube pan with palm rejection let's try it with another application the Microsoft or node application so if you need to try and make use of the smaller screen and then also rest your hand not on the screen goodness a palm down and then kind of slightly tilt it and right and as I said you can write not very precisely and not I'm smaller size so it has to be it's this kind of big so it is doable it's not bad let's look at how much is the latency of this pain so using this stylus pen or iPad Mini 2 I think the response rate is quite okay let me also show you how is it you use it on force but a single hundred use using the note1 apps on your mobile phone and it is still ok you can write so there's no problem there in user that's a good steigler then you can write so friends as you have seen this pen can be used to write on your tablets or mobile but the comfort of writing is definitely not something which I'm happy about the first problem itself is that this is just not have palm rejection and using on these kind of devices even if it's a bigger or smaller we always used to resting our palm and then writing it so that you are precise and you write accurately but when you don't have an option to rest your palm writing it without that is not easy and though it is something we can still do you can get used to it and then try and make use of the the cases keep it in an angle and then kind lean it down side and write it but I would say this is not practical so I was so I wanted something to try and see if I can make use of my iPad Mini Q it is a capacitive screen so it you can't use the Apple pencils on this so I wanted to see if I can buy something and then try and make it right so that I can use this for my as my digital notebook but that not being an option I tried with this and I'm not actually happy using this one is a round tip I don't feel very comfortable using that not accurate second is the the position of writing though it is doable it's not practical so I don't think this is something which I have to continue using or recommend if you are very keen on using tablets for writing there should be other options which I will try and explore and see if something works out but for now if you think this product is for you give it a shot I bought this in Malaysia for around 20 a trinkets I couldn't find this brand in India but there are other similar brands and a similar kind of stylus pens available for around 400 450 rupees so you can always try and explore that so friends that's a review of this basis stylus pen for your capacitive touchscreen devices if you found this video useful do give it a like and subscribe for more videos which is coming your way and next time is Prasad g4 GSP creations thank you", "U8FYi-y6agI": "hey guys the rise of tablets has made it possible to draft electronic notes surf the web and produce digital artwork wherever you go but it can be challenging to create precise lines or shapes using just your fingertip if you need to use your tablet to its full potential you need a stylus pen a stylus is a small pen shaped device that is used to input instructions to a computer screen mobile device or graphics tablet in this video we're gonna show you some of the best stylus pens that are available on the market while capacitive touchscreens are high one defect is the failure to use a stylus not anymore amazonbasics stylus enables you to use your Apple iPad iPhone Kindle Touch Kindle Fire or another tablet device without ever touching the screen with your fingers ideal for the ladies out there who have their nails arranged or for those who don't want to take their gloves off during a snowy day the Amazon basic stylus is conveniently sized with an eight millimeter diameter and compose like a pen to fit just about anywhere this stylus looks pretty standard it comes only in black and has nothing but a lanyard at the top and an excellent capacitive tip at the bottom the body has a light matte finish like numerous other styluses the tip gives an outstanding performance with its high Sensibility it's just right a more squishy tip blocks your view when writing on a screen but the amazonbasics stylus tip doesn't even Bend like those on some of the cheaper styluses do it is durable and it is an ideal pick for you this high quality stylus is perfect for those who need to write notes with it draw or casually use it with their phone or tablet the Miko disc stylus is made from stainless steel and aluminum with no plastic parts for a real pen feeling this is the second creation of Miko styluses the first generation has a more smooth body while the second generation highlights a more substantial grip the stylus is mostly made of metal and has a fine hefty weight to it and feels suitable to hold it does not feel cheap even though it is cheap to access the disc tip you just have to unscrew the grip section and then screw the other side of the grip to the body of the pen the stylus itself is well stable and has a nice weight to it doesn't feel too light or too flimsy like some of the cheaper pens it also feels higher quality than you would suppose with its chrome ends and rubber strip which makes it more convenient to hold it is not only used for taking notes and drawing apps but also perfect for playing games with the precision tips and clear discs the transparent disc allows you to see exactly where your mark is being made and gives you the accurate point the Apple pencil for the iPad pro opens up new creative possibilities it's sensitive to pressure and tilt so you can easily vary line weight create subtle shading and produce a wide range of creative effects this pencil stylus for iPad pro is like a conventional pencil but with pixel perfect precision aside from creative projects you can also use it to control games and for a wide range of other purposes the pencil is virtually entirely white with just a metallic band at the non-writing end by the charging lid it has a glossy hard ceramic feel except for the tip which is matte softer and slightly off-white in an extra tip in the box but unlike Microsoft's new surface Pro stylus with its variety of tip sizes this is a straight replacement for the starting tip Apple

samsung's galaxy note a handful of reports published towards the end of last year suggested that samsung in a bid to more fully focus on devices like its foldables would push off or even discontinue the note line entirely but shortly afterwards a another anonymous source who says they work at samsung told one of korea's major news agencies that yeah no the galaxy note is definitely still a thing we're just gonna wait until next year to release them which is fine but it sort of lacks the definitiveness you'd get if someone like tm row for example just came out and said no don't worry we're still going to keep making those phones that you like until we hear something like that though all we can really do is speculate and in my case try out something that's kind of meant to be an alternative i'm talking of course about the galaxy s21 which we reviewed a few weeks ago and actually really kind of enjoyed but that's obviously only half of the equation samsung now sells a version of the s pen a 40 stylus specifically for the s21 ultra and more importantly it also sells that pen with a case for an extra 30 so 70 bucks total gets you something that kind of sort of makes the s21 ultra feel like a galaxy note a proper galaxy note it should be exciting but after living with this thing for about a week i gotta tell you i'm not sold now let me clear a couple things up right out of the gate that is not at all the fault of the s pen it's honestly kind of a pleasure to use but that's me i've always kind of enjoyed the s pen here's what i like about it for one it's huge compared to this little twig that comes with a galaxy note 20 ultra in this case the s pen that samsung now sells separately for the s21 ultra is about four inches long it's a little bit over but who's counting and it just feels so much more comfortable to use because you're not constantly trying to find the right angle to just hold this tiny tiny twig of a pen whether you're sketching or you're taking down notes comfort while writing is of huge importance and samsung's new s pen really delivers on that front if you've ever used a galaxy note before you know that there are a couple things that kind of help define the experience if you have an s pen for example and you hold it within range of your phone just sort of just above the display the wacom digitizer can tell the pen is there and sort of lets you see a cursor moving around more importantly when you're within range of that screen just a couple millimeters above you can click the button on the s pen to bring up a palette of shortcuts so you can create new notes launch apps like pen up translate make live messages or capture a screenshot and use the s pen to mark them up these are key parts of the note experience and those in fact work really well on the galaxy s21 it does everything you'd expect the classic s pen to do and i do mean classic because within the last few years we've seen samsung styluses get really intelligent they come with bluetooth low energy and tiny capacitors inside so they actually do charge and interact with the phone so you can perform things like those weird magic wand air gestures and move back and forth through apps and control media and even control your camera which unfortunately is just not on the table here you'll have to wait for a bigger more expensive version of the s pen called the s pen pro which is coming later this year but i'm getting ahead of myself i'm one of those people who really feels like i kind of only process information and commit it to memory when i'm writing it down so getting used to the s pen and just sort of re-acclimating to writing stuff down has been for the most part a pleasure on the s21 ultra and that's partially because in some important ways there there isn't a huge difference between what you get on this expensive smartphone and last year's expensive smartphone with the s pen the latency samsung says is identical between the two if you're running the s21 ultra's display at its fastest refresh rate which didn't always seem to be the case when i was writing our review i was testing the s21 ultra with this lami uh s pen which they like gave out after an event and i saw moments where the strokes on screen were sort of trailing pretty dramatically behind the nib itself which thankfully hasn't happened with the s pen that samsung itself has made even if there are differences there and again i don't think you're really going to notice them but even if there are when you're just sort of writing stuff down when you're taking notes when you're transcribing documents or marking up an image you're really not going to see anything the input latency seems at least to my eyes to be barely there it's almost instantaneous that said if you're an artist you might sort of lose out on some little fine precise motions i certainly haven't experienced that but earlier versions of the s pen have tilt detection which basically allow the phone to recognize the angle at which you're holding the pen and sort of reproduce the way the stroke would look if you were drawing with a pen and paper at that same angle i did not think samsung's new s pen would be able to do that because there is no connection really between the pen and the s21 ultra there's no bluetooth it's all whatever is happening through that wacom digitizer that said it still does work to an extent i when you try out the pencil for example you can sort of come in at an angle and do a bit of light shading it's not great but it doesn't seem too too different from what i saw in the galaxy note 20 ultra there are obviously some edge cases i'm probably not aware of and again completely not an artist but if you have the opportunity as a digital art enthusiast to try out the s pen with a galaxy s21 ultra before buying i really strongly recommend you take that time for the most part though this thing just behaves the way you would expect in s pen too which in my book at least is a pretty significant compliment i've used these things for years on and off and i always really enjoy the time i spend with them and that is very much the same here as well i gotta say though this case is not great and that is where realistically 98 of my complaints lie for one it's made of silicone which is itself not necessarily a bad thing but it just means that this case suffers from all the other issues that all the other silicone cases out there fall prey to so it gets kind of grimy looking really easily it picks up finger oils and sort of doesn't look very nice after a while it picks up lint like crazy too but that's obvious it sort of goes in and out of a pocket and sort of grips everything on the way out my bigger issue is that this thing is i mean it's big that's a very obvious complaint but it is one of the things i've really struggled to wrap my head and my hands around for the past few days the galaxy s21 ultra is already a big phone i'm throwing a case on it that gives it just like a couple extra millimeters of stuff on the side now with that in mind i do not know what samsung really could have done i mean if at the end of the day their job was to make a case you put the s pen into so you don't lose the s pen i applaud the sentiment and of course it's gonna make this thing kind of enormous oh and another thing the s pen slots into these cases left side because the right side of the s21 ultra is just covered in buttons my only issue and this is a very is very much a me thing like don't don't dwell on this too much but i i've not been able to just like rewire my muscle memory to be able to just like pull out the s ped with my left hand i just it's it's a total dud i can't do anything with it that means whenever i am in a grocery store or standing out somewhere and want to jot something down i have to pull out the thing i've got to sort of do a quick little awkward juggle and then pull the s pen out with my right hand and flip it back and then do whatever it is i want it to do that's a very specifically me thing but i know i know a lot of other people are gonna run into that same thing that said if you're a lefty good job this one's for you there is one more thing i gotta say i do not like about this case there is a bit right near the usbc charging port where the material gets really thin and kind of moves around a lot without too much effort i could definitely see that getting sort of stuck on my keys as i'm trying to pull out of my pocket or or snagging on something in my backpack just just like a little extra material samsung just like a little bit more would have made me feel a whole lot better so at the end of the day this case and this s pen will again not magically turn your galaxy s21 ultra into a full-blown galaxy note but it does get close in some important ways if it were up to me just ditch the case entirely make a promise to yourself that you're not going to lose the s pen and buy a 40 s pen or if you really want to see what the full note experience can look like on a galaxy s phone you can wait to the s pen pro shows up whenever that shows up thanks for watching and i'll see you next time you", "zYco8H-kTp8": "welcome to the show today jb here excited here with me and because of you uh the wonderful subscribers here i have the lamy safari stylist s stylist that we're going to open up today but we're going to do a little bit of a hack because uh it's been suggested so many times in the comments that i give this a shot with the remarkable but not only give it a shot but try out something different it's a little bit of a hack so we're gonna do that as you know if you watch my video a couple weeks ago on this uh statler estadler i don't even know how to say it staidler pencil i've been using this with a graphite tip on it i actually like it a lot uh it writes really smooth i like the pencil feel so if you're into pencils this this is a really good device it's been great for writing obviously as we open this up i actually had the marker signature at one time which is actually a little bit heavier pin but for some reason it disappeared i have no idea it wasn't meant to be so it's no longer around so now i have uh the regular remarkable very light uh pencil but it has more of a writing sound to it and that comes from the nib right and we're going to talk about that these nibs are what's so critical when it comes to this so as we look at um alternatives here we have the lamy now and a lot of people love this device so when i open the lamy up it comes with its uh nib changer okay where you change the nibs out let's see what else is in here and then we've got the lamy i think it's got a cool a cool little um box it's got like edges on it and stuff you can kind of see that so when we get this open we have the lamy and there's some paperwork and stuff but when it comes to this you can see between the three of these okay that um they're all kind of similar and if i had the remarkable pen which i had which is actually called the marker signature marker that's the box for it it would fit about this size and just be heavier so you have like what's like a pencil here you have the remarkable and then you have the lamy okay so let's go ahead and give them a try so a lamy it's got the same feeling it's got that same these two are almost exactly the same okay as i go but i do like the lamy if you like that feel a little bit better oh that was different okay let's erase all this and i i had a fountain lamy pin like this so it actually fits that pretty good my issue it doesn't fit in my little uh carrier here my little case but the lamy itself's got kind of that graphite tip feel the same as this pencil does here where the remarkable has a little bit more of a scratchy riding sound and feel to it so what the hack has been suggested is that you use this little tool that all these things come with and you take this nib out if you've ever done this before pull that nib out okay so that one's out and then you bring in a nib from the remarkable okay so this is a remarkable nib i'm gonna put this in there kind of hard to do this while you're filming okay so now we have a remarkable nib in let's see the feel and there we go okay now we have that soft remarkable feel with the lamy pin so i like that hack you guys did good let me see if i can do it with a pencil too i think i can do the same thing i do like the graphite though i do like the feel of this it's a little bit different yeah i can do the same i don't know if i can i'm sure i can do the same thing yeah i can change this one out too but i'm gonna leave that because i actually like the feel of that it's a little bit different um but that chain that actually worked out pretty good that worked out pretty good so the idea then in today's video is to if you order the lamy and i'll put the link down below it is a good replacement if you like a thicker pin okay you like a thicker pin you can see that the remarkable is actually very thin and it's very similar to the pencil but i actually like the pencils so if you like the pencil and i'll put a link to this stat tiller pencil down below and you can actually you know try that out as a pencil and then the regular marker and the pen are you know they're decent the pin for the remarkable is good too like i said i lost that but then you got the lamy which comes in with a real nice feel and you if you have the graphite tip that's fine it works but to switch to the remarkable tip you get that remarkable soft feel that so many other people are looking for so it's really good i like it that hack thanks to you again by you putting the idea uh in the comments it was awesome and as always you know i i'm telling you we have the smartest subscribers on youtube just by looking at the comments of the videos that we have so this is a great hack for those of you that are looking for an alternative to the remarkable stylus you still get the nice smooth feel but you're getting a real nice a nice pin that kind of goes with it like i said i have a fountain pen that's very similar so i like the lambie my only issue is is it doesn't fit in the case but i you know i get a nice clip and i can figure that that's a first real problem i'll figure that out so now i gotta organize all these nibs and all these styluses i will tell you the qua and i've been saying this wrong the whole time the qua d'erno okay uh which i've been utilizing actually has a i think a better stylus it's actually the old sony it's now from brandon fujitsu it has two buttons on it one allows you to race one allows you to highlight which i prefer so far this is my favorite stylus but i'll put it up there with with the lamy and i'll be using the lamy more on the remarkable and especially when i get my remarkable two when we get the thing right um so awesome so what do i like okay the remarkable is decent i'll put it up there i do like the pencil a lot i actually like the graphite feel i don't think i need to change that out i would probably put the lamy up for the number one accessory right now for the remarkable and and i do that too also by the comments that we've been getting we've been getting so many comments of everybody telling me to do that and yes it's good but use the lamy change it out put the remarkable nib in you got a heck of a heck of a stylist there and my overall favorite goes to the quaderno stylus which actually is electronic and gives you a little bit of help but this will not work on the remarkable just fyi that will not work it's probably my favorite eating stylist is what i'm saying but if i was with the remarkable and you're looking for one the pencil is great if you like thin right thin style and if you like something a little bit um thicker and you like that fountain pen kind of feel uh then i would go with the lamy if you like a pin feel i don't have it with me the remarkable pin or the remarkable marker they call it actually works pretty good i'll tell you i put it up there as a pretty good device but lamy pencil remarkable that's the order all

Lisa from mobile tech review and it spend time this is the Wacom Bamboo tip this is a new pen from Wacom welcome to the folks who those are you're into art already know this make the Wacom Cintiq lines that's on my bucket list and the best thing ever if you're an artist to draw on drawing pen displays the walk of mobile studio pro they also make the digitizers a Wacom yesterday ES digitizer is used in recent Dell two and ones Lenovo is all that sort of thing so you get the idea but they also make some handy dandy stuff for those of you who have just a capacitive display now I know some of you write to me you message me on Twitter and you say oh I bought the wrong laptop or I bought this phone and is there any kind of pen that I can use for it and usually it's just all that old fat capacitive stylus which is just really nasty so the nice thing about this one is this a one point nine millimeter tip so it's a lot more fine tip if it feels and looks like one of those active digitizer pens however it's still capacitive so we're gonna find out how well it works now so the bamboo tip is a capacitive stylus this is not for those products that already have an active digitizer because it's redundant and well inferior to an active digitizer ie surface pro with intrigue digitizer Wacom AES in the Lenovo ThinkPad yoga on the iPad pro and the Apple pencil if you've got one of those devices you want to use pins that were meant for them because they're gonna be better in all respects but for those who have bought a device and say like a dell inspiron 5000 that we've been a test this on or more aptly what they aim this at is Android and iOS users say your regular ipad non pro model your your iPhone your Android tablet or phone this is a driverless non bluetooth device that you just well charge it up and it works so that's kind of nice no fussing with Bluetooth non no hokey-pokey no clunky things going on and it looks pretty classy and it said for $50 right this looks nice it's metal barrel pen and the tip at one point nine millimeters certainly is a lot more precise in your average and this is just your basic capacitive stylus which is gee this is like trying to write with a crayon in comparison it's just not so great so how does this work it has an on/off button on the side which is recess and you're not going to press this by accident and you press it quickly once and to turn it off and it'll blink twice an amber if you want to turn it on press it and it goes green now it will go to sleep to save battery power when if you just leave it be here and you're not doing anything which is nice how do you charge it right up top here there's a little rubber cover and there's a micro USB port and it comes with a little cable here and they say that you get about two hours of use time on a charge which is decent it's not as good as the quadruple a power and active pens that we've looked at but that's not too bad this is an interesting thing usually capacitive ones do not have any power I think they're doing it to amping to amp the level of capacitance or conductivity so that they can use the smaller tip here and still have the thing work by the way the nibs are replaceable on this and Wacom does sell them on their site so switch here is in case you find that it's a little jumpy when you're writing mostly they say that would be for the iPad pro again I would really spend the money for the pencil if you've already bought the expensive iPad pro to get the best writing experience but that's what that little switch is for so how well does it work well here we have an iPhone 8 plus and again no software installation no pairing no nothing is required and I'm using SketchBook Pro application here and that's fantastic and I can actually see because SketchBook Pro supports pressure sensitivity even with your finger I'm pressing harder the lines getting darker that you can even get something like a little bit of pressure sensitivity here this is about the best experience here and on Android phones that you're going to get but still I'm seeing the lines sometimes lagging behind enough following so much the the big caveat here is there's no palm rejection that means you can't rest your hand on the screen at the same time and I do that see it's no longer writing because it's confused is about what the contact point is that's a drawback with all capacitive pins because your hand is also capacitive so it doesn't really know what to do about that but it's not too bad if you just want to use this as a big note pad say you're an iPhone person but you really really like that Galaxy Note 8 note-taking feature this is adequate certainly for taking notes and it's better than drawing with your finger I'll give it that it most certainly is even though yeah it's yet not as good as an active digit now we have Adobe Photoshop sketch on the essential phone and Android phone right here and again no pairing no Bluetooth no nothing and that's how it writes it's a little bit harder to get the e say for example on this it's it's minimizing my strokes a little bit well that's not the greatest thing in the world so I switch over to brush like now if you're doing artwork actually this is a little bit of a nicer experience it's got pretty nice flow here and well we could do an abstract tree really quick well not really so much but you know you get the idea that's a little bit better as a writing tool here yeah you know it's gonna vary a little bit from phone to phone when it comes to Android 2 depending on the display because the different displays are different levels of capacitance just for giggles this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 instead of using the s-pen we're gonna use this pen and see how well it does so that's not too bad I'm trying to draw a little highlight on the mountain there again it's not tracking real perfectly if you're gonna do artwork and the tilt of the pen can really throw it off this is a pen that you want to use kind of upright more so if you wanted to draw underneath the tip and I've noticed in general with laptops too that have active digitizers this actually works a little bit better than with ones that are just capacitive touchscreen only so there you have it so just again so you can see the variability between devices here but it certainly is better than trying to draw with your finger this is really oh that's terrible that's a mess so how about Android tablets this is a Samsung Galaxy Tab s2 this a previous generation it has no active pen support and this is Walken's own bamboo paper application which is a pretty nice application actually for note-taking or for drawing too so this one tracks really well the most awkward thing here is I'm trying to rest my hand on the frame so I don't put my hand on the glass and let's see if I can do a little sketch oh that's interesting it's been doing the line it's not too bad can usually missing let's joke but if I rest my hand on here it's all I'm not going to work it also again that's just the challenge of anything as capacitive and it's just gonna go out to lunch for a little bit before it comes back again no pressure sensitivity going on here but I did again it's certainly better than doing this and how about if we switch to well just your basic five dollar what at the local electronic store fat tape stylus not a whole lot better there in fact it's a little bit worse it's a little bit more awkward for drawing because I can't be very precise with this tip so you do get precision from that fine tip and that helps so how about laptops this is where I know a lot of you are interested in these kind of products because you bought a laptop and maybe you're even misled by the salesperson you thought it had an active pen and digitizer and it doesn't well this is a Dell Inspiron 13 5000 series laptop it does not have an active digitizer we've got Autodesk SketchBook Pro program here again and once again you're gonna have to not touch the screen while you're working so let's just test out noting this is not a real great solution here and the Dell XPS 13 and various other laptops to try the LG Graham 15 the capacitive displays and this are not really working so one you could do a better job with your finger here probably has to do with the amount of power that's actually required to do anything so let's try it with this one as you can see still not so great so capacitor pens in general that are not using bluetooth are not a great alternative yet for these and even the Bluetooth ones have their drawbacks you really just better off getting something that was built with Windows ink capabilities built in whether it's wakame yes walking EMR entering any of those active pens so that's the Wacom Bamboo tip as capacitive stylus Azure pens go this is the best that I've seen yet as good as it gets no drivers needed for installation just charge it plug and play go and that part's pretty nice the lack of palm rejection the usual problems of capacitive pens and generally speaking no pressure sensitivity though some iPad apps or iPhone apps might actually give some degree of a sensation of pressure sensitivity in general if you got stuck with a device that doesn't have an active digitizer and pen and you really wish it did but you can't replace the device this $50 pen certainly is about as good as it's going to get right now I'm a super mobile tech review be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more cool tech videos and thumbs up like this vid", "rY8zkDgHY1Q": "hey guys I'll be back in today show you another video today we're gonna take a look at two of the styluses from the speaking range we've got the h1 4 and the H 1 0 so let's get started okay so let's focus on the cube H 1 4 stylus and this has been designed to enhance writing and browsing experience on all capacitive touchscreen so basically the pen has two tips one replacement they're both the same and it's actually really handy I used it for juries like drawing this clip doesn't really help because it just might brighten like a smiley face but it does work with like if you want to do quite a nice picture it features a really nice design so you can just slot it in your pocket if you need to it's not heavy at all so you know it's really handy and made new materials aluminium so you know universally was strong and it's gonna work and it works on all capacitive touch screens which most touch means are these days and don't really find any other kind of touch screens these days so if you're looking for a light artwork or just if you like to type or browse with a stylus then definitely get this one because it's handy for just for that and I've loved using it so far so here is the h1 oh no this is the smaller version compared to the h1 for this comes in white pink yellow red and black and I have the white version here as you can see now this stylus is mainly aimed at tablets but can also be used on phones and iPods it's good for drawing and browsing the internet but compared to the h1 for I would say this is better for drawing and it's better for taking on the go as it has like a little line yds bit so if you just take on the go you could just clip it to your device if it has compatibility for that you can just clip it along and it would be easy there but it is very slim very light lets me know some great materials so it's very strong as well while testing out this phallus I was really impressed now I was the American artist so I didn't have to take the best use out of it but for casual use like many of you will use it for it worked very well it was very responsive and work just by Nexus 5 I was really happy with it so there you have it now this was not a comparison video it is it like a combined review sort of thing I don't want to make two separate reviews I definitely think that any point because they'll be quite short so I put these two in the same video as that from the same series of a product series so you can check them out in the link in the description I think it's around three different types of I have two of them here but as I said they're really good I would definitely recommend the little one the h10 sorry I got the confused there I definitely recommend h10 a bit more over the h1 for because it's more compact and it just seems a lot better for taking on the go but if you're not going to take out that much in the h1 for will still be definitely good for you thanks watching this video guys if you enjoyed it please give a massive thumbs up and I'll see you guys next time", "Xw-Yty0vTws": "this is Lisa from mobile tech review and this is a pen this is the Wacom Bamboo ink plus pen so it's the latest pen from Wacom it's $99 and it's what they call a dual protocol pen so what does that mean today's laptops and convertible tablets that run Windows and usually have one of two digitizer types it's either end Trigg which is what Microsoft Surface Devices uses and also HP Spectre and some masseuse and then there is Wacom yes which is what Lenovo and Dell typically use so you don't have to go crazy finding the right pen which has never been any fun they have one pen that does both protocols and there is a third kind which is welcome EMR but you only find that usually on higher and purpose-built artist devices and also Samsung notebooks so it wouldn't be compatible with Samsung home folks but pretty much everything else that has an active digitizer we're gonna look at it now so as pens go this one is fairly ergonomically delightful which counts if you're gonna be doing a lot of note-taking or art work it's kind of round but it's a little bit triangular at the same time which means it's kind of easy to grip compared to something that's just round it has a slightly matte not exactly soft touch finish so it feels nicer than the kind of stark metal say of the service pro pen or most of the pens Adele and lenovo throw in with their convertibles and digitizer equipped machines it's USB C rechargeable so no sourcing quadruple a batteries the upside is well done you don't have to go out and find and buy those batteries that typically last six months or a year for most people but the downside is is that battery life typically isn't as good on these pens are USB C rechargeable we saw the same thing only to a greater extreme with with HP's tilt pen which is USB C rechargeable now this does have an on/off button if you hit the bottom button it'll turn it on and off supposedly I think it goes to sleep by itself so part of this maybe I'm not being mindful about turning it off if indeed that's necessary the one-page Quick Start Guide really doesn't tell you too much about them there are two buttons down the barrel and you can assign them to be different functions which is always handy if you press and hold the two of them together you can switch between entering or what's now called Microsoft print 10 protocol and wakame yes now I found out of the box it actually did both and I didn't have to manually switch it but you can do that you just hold the both buttons down for about two seconds you'll see the little white LED flash twice and you're good to go it also has bluetooth it's not required for any functionality on the pen in terms of how in Inked s-- but it can do things like quick launching the apps of your choice do a screen shot that sort of things so you press and hold the button on the butt end of the pen to pair it up via bluetooth if you wish to do that now the pen supports 4096 pressure levels and the pressure sensitivity on this is very good and it also supports tilt but here's a caveat only if the digitizer on your laptop or tablet actually supports tilt some do some don't so with the Microsoft Surface pro liner products yes the latest generation you do get tilt and it works beautifully on it with the Wacom AES devices some of them yes some of them no again it's going to depend on that machine when I review each machine I was talk about whether or not it does support tilt for my HP Spectre x-360 products no the they do tilt in a weird way where they require their own tilt pen that actually handles tilt me a Bluetooth which is a little bit different so you're not gonna get it there in the Box you get a little USB C to USB cable for charging USB a that is and you also get a set of nibs you get one of those marks off one that's marked hard and one that's marked blue blue mysterious yes now my one complaint about that is and the others have little white rings on them are like grey and the blue one should have a little blue on it so you can actually tell it apart from the others but anyway the blue on if you read on their website they have a link you can follow to learn about compatibility some wakame yes digitizers will do better with that blue NIMH so that's why that ones there the case itself has a little nib puller it's a little hole on it I found a little hard to use so I just resorted to one of the many ring nib pullers that I have around but there it is so how does it actually work well you know I love Wacom products I'm a real fan but I have to say that what I've realized is that manufacturers HP Lenovo Dell all of them Microsoft have done a very good job of optimizing their own pens for their own devices because they found in each case that the bamboo ink plus had more jitter which is wobbly lines you'll notice it more if you're doing slow diagonal lines a good way to illustrate the problem but even doing big gestures you can see the lines are more crisp when I use the actual manufacturer pen for a given device with less of that kind of not so smooth looking curve than going on in terms of pressure levels it's equally as good in terms of tilt it's equally as good as the manufacturer pen so if you're looking for something that does work with multiple devices then it's a selling point if you didn't get the pen in the box with your laptop or tablet and you're having trouble sourcing the one then those are the selling points for the Wacom along with is for charge ability now I tested this on several devices so we've got Microsoft Surface pro 6 up first and we about the surface pro pen which is also $99 and the bamboo pen and you can see there's more jitter and less smoothness of line but otherwise killt and pressure work equally well with both of the Pens with the HP spectre x360 13 inch gem cut and that has a pretty mediocre intrigue digitizing it to be honest and nothing is going to help it it's really up to the digitizer more than the pen so it has jitter with both pens but less with the HP pen and tilt is not supported with this pen or with the stock pen that you get in the HP box unless you pay for their tilt pen using bluetooth instead so yeah the HP pen is typically cheaper though so you might want to go for the HP pen and lastly we tried the Dell Latitude 7200 two-in-one which is their basically Microsoft Surface pro 6 con and that uses wakame yes things get a little more interesting there because you can actually download they have a little driver that you can download you can see it how it looks on right now and once you install that you get some deep functionality besides things like assigning different functions to your pens you can set both tilt sensitivity and I left it at minimum because boy it thinks everything is a tilt otherwise and you can set pressure curves which is important and nice to be able to do as well and you even have the option of having a little charge level battery indicator in the taskbar so you know how much battery you have left in the pen but bear - I would say that the Dell pen there comes with this machine actually did a little bit better in terms of smooth lines and jitter again for pressure sensitivity and for for tilt shading that sort of thing they were equally as good so that's the Wacom Bamboo ink plus and as a piece of hardware aesthetically speaking how it feels in the hand this is great the recharge ability is nice so you might have to deal with that more often than you actually would with replacing batteries on the pens that use batteries I'm but I'm not gonna say that this gives you something that the manufacturers on pen doesn't because I found the manufacturers pens are a little bit better in terms of smooth lines and jitter like I told you for these devices that we've tested here and this isn't bad at all but it's not quite great if you're doing note-taking you probably won't even notice as you can see in my handwriting samples I mean it's close enough right you're just taking notes but for those who are looking at this for diagramming or for doing artwork yeah I would go with the manufacture pen sorry welcome I'm Lisa from mobile tech review be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more cool tech videos and pins up if you like this vid",

the top of the box has a hinged top to it this is the carbon fiber version of the pen it also comes in a rose gold where this is carbon fiber here with metallic or these are actually Meadowlands with black accents on the ends of the black clip this is the stylus version of the pen so we have a stylist attached to the end of the pan which can be used for whatever kind of device you might have for an iPad for iphone or any other kind of tablet or device this is a ink ball pen which to extend the refill you simply push it in like a you would a ballpoint pen and the refill will extend out or three tracked it you just release it that way you can remove the ink ball by removing the cap here on the end and that this pen comes standard with a converter on it also inside of the box or underneath it with the false bottom of the box we have additional ink cartridge and an adapter so if you'd rather use the ink cartridges rather than the standard fountain pen ink you can do that as

panchal a calm", "8DLldfy0ETM": "hi Steven from owner disa today gonna do a quick video on a digital pen our scent now as you know I'm rather partial to doing taking notes on a Windows ink laptop and I've done quite a few reviews on two and ones fact my go-to laptop is the asus zenbook flip 14 but i also have the air XPS 15 to 1 both of those do use different technologies note here the XPS 15 uses Wacom AES while the Zenbook flip 14 uses Microsoft pen protocol so consequently I've got quite a collection of pens II and I I was sent one called the pack dot pen and that uses Windows pen protocol and that's targeted for people using the surface line you know whether it's the surface pro or surface book and so we're going to take it a quick look at it now and see you know see what's in the box and how it performs compared to it pops a few of the ones so the pack top pen has a nice long neighbour I do like that the button placement isn't too bad it's a little bit further up cause you have the two buttons one for delete one right click no clickable end which is a shame and of course you've got the clip here for your pocket now it is a cynical silver body so it is a little bit slippery now compare that to the bamboo ink it's a similar length of course about the same and the button placement is about the same to put the bamboo ink and feels a lot more comfortable it's actually more triangular in shape and there's a rubbery coating to it the seuss pen which I use further like the Flip 14 pretty much the same shortened nib though you will notice and [Music] it's about the same length and button placement it's actually a bit high up on your Suz pen and this is the the original surface pen McCain of course I comes with lots of different nibs but the this the surface pen does feel more comfortable in the hand because of its hexagonal shape and the length is the same as well and of course but you do have a button to activate things here let's take a look at some art applications first off is the pack top pen I'm using a pencil light strokes are fine certainly seems okay to me next is the Zeus pen not as responsive your prescribed with bit harder as well to get it to be darker so not as good the surface pen that's okay that's quite good that's that's similar to the pack top and finally the bamboo ink yeah that one feels better alright so the one note waiting test pack top pen works nice and smoothly and the raising button which weld to your sous pen this was okay to put it there there's a little bit less friction so it's air friction so just so glides more on the glass first surface pen more friction and the amazing button takes more pressing air pressure to activate and the bamboo pen now this is my favorite one it does say he glides nicely he's a little bit friction and it feels good in the hand so my favorite one is of course it's still the bamboo ink pen I do like the fact that they can switch between between different protocols and it saves you having to buy a new pen all the time and you know what it feels nice and it has a certain amount of resistance when you're writing with it and of course you've got the the button at the end to activate say OneNote should you wish so I do like that but the POC dot pen is up there I do like the fact it's got a bigger nib and that does make it feel a bit more natural it's a little bit smooth to hold a little bit slippery I guess but you know it's not too bad the button placement isn't too bad it's bit further up the pen so you don't always accidentally press it with your fingers and that's quite a big thing for me and like them all they do have a it does have a you know thing you just put in your pocket so you can do that there's no button at the end to press or anything like that but still that's okay for $34 it's a good note-taking pen is it good for art artists well it's OK for me but you know with 1096 I mean 1024 levels of spare sensitivity it may not be good for professional artists but for a doodle doodle like me it's perfectly fine so and I know right yeah please check it out I've got it in the description below $34 you commonly go wrong so thanks for watching like subscribe see you next day", "9AYQ5ApjvAc": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this so do do do you", "A2OQu9mIXOQ": "hey enjoy here for my next tablet calm today with an unboxing of the huawei media pet m 5y10 and the Huawei and Pen light alright see what we media pet and 5 light 10 has been announced for Europe a couple of weeks ago it's available here now starting at 299 euros however I don't think it is available in the United States or a jet but I think it will be soon that might take about a couple of months not a couple of months a couple of weeks up to a month maybe but it should be available everywhere I'm pretty sure of that because previous versions have been so yeah in this video we want to unbox see why we immediate @m 5 light 10 as the name says it is the light version of the immediate @m 5 serious that was announced in February I believe of this year anyway every beauty M 5 10 and m58 and you know those are quite nice tablets high-end tablets and if you don't need as many features then you might want to take a look at the immediate pad m5 light 10 it actually has a very similar design however the performance won't be as good and the display is not as high resolution but if you need two speakers fingerprint scanners on than the m5 like 10 might be the tablet for you right inside the box Ian that was a tablet and let's take a look inside the box first we've got sim eject tool or micro SD card eject tool I've cut the wire version but there will be an ad version as well that will also support GPS inside the box we've got a warranty card and a Quick Start Guide and then we've got a cable here that doesn't want to go out there we go it's a standard USB type a two USB type-c cable so that's certainly nice to see that it is USB type-c then we've got the standard charger over here all right let's put all of this to the side first then we can take a look at the wow am pen light as you might remember there so you are we meet at m5 Pro that has the Huawei m10 and the enter light is very similar however the standard event supports 4096 pressure points say our pressure sensitive but this one only 2048 pressure points or half pressure sensitive and but I'm not sure if I will notice a difference probably not but maybe if you are design or something then you might notice a difference so this is the M Pen light looks very similar to the standard antenna as I said it won't be s pressure sensitive but for most people it should be fine because I believe most of the Wacom tablets for a long time they only supported 1024 pressure points however there is AAA battery inside triple-a battery I believe you can take it out here and that's pretty much it it seems to be made out of metal mostly maybe a bit plastic on the top here and that it certainly and nicer to hold when for example these Samsung Galaxy Note S Pen which is very thin obviously it fits into the tablet which is great and but if you hold the Galaxy Note stylus for a long time it's a bit uncomfortable so it's nicer if it yes a bit thicker like normal pen all right that is the stylus we will take a closer look at it later and you can exchange the tip here all right that's all of this and now we can take a look at the tablet itself and yeah what do we have here a 10.1 inch display that seems to be turning on already it has a resolution of 1920 by 1200 was an ethnic ratio of 16 by 10 then we've got an 8 megapixel front-facing camera the huawei logo and the fingerprint reader on the bottom which is certainly nice to see so that you can unlock it easily and the main selling point about this tablet are the speakers at least one of the main selling points a 2 on the top and two on the bottom so like with the standard media pad and five you've got four speakers in total and that's certainly nice to see on this side we've got a volume rocker and the power button I'm not sure segments of metal maybe they're plastic maybe matter then we've got a little plastic bag here where we have the antennas and so on then we've got another 8 megapixel camera the Huawei logo and on this side we've got a micro SD card slot and the some concert will be located here as well and then we've got a USB C port and what's really nice a standard headphone jack you might remember the media pad and five serious does not have a headphone jack but we've got one here it's really nice to see all right um yes a bit quality seems to be really good seems to be almost identical to the media pattern five serious unit is a bit better than the Wow me da pad T 510 which has the same internal hardware but it doesn't have the force because another fingerprint scanner and no pen support I actually have seen media type P 510 here if you want to check out my boxing it's up already and the review will be up soon I have my battery's running right now so I don't want to mess with it too much at now apart yeah the review will be up soon and as I said the internal hardware similar but this one has more premium features force because fingerprint scanner and stylus support and almost the whole body is aluminium with CT 510 we've got a bit of a plastic bezel alright yeah let's turn it on and take a look at the software somebody turned on I would set it up then we take a look at the displays a software and so on alright I'm back I connected the Huawei meet up at m5 like 10 to my wife I'm a cook and so on and I already played with it a bit and yeah let's start with the display as I said earlier it's 10.1 inches and it has Apple HD resolution of 1920 by 1080 and I think on 10 inches that's a pretty nice resolution if you're holding it normally in front of you everything looks sharp however it's full HD on 10 inches so if you're not looking very closely then you can see some some pictures maybe even remember almost every smartphone has a higher pixel density and if you want a higher resolution screen you can check out the normal Huawei media pad M 510 not the light version that one has a higher resolution screen but otherwise the screen seems to be pretty good it's an IPS panel with good viewing angles colors look nicer contrast it's good and it's laminated so there's no air gap between the touchscreen and she at the S panel unlike with the iPad 2018 for example and yeah so the screen seems to be pretty good it also seems to be bright enough I'm not sure how bright it will be in daylight I would certainly check that out in sunlight for my final will be you let's take another look at C fingerprint scanner I set it up already and it works fast and precisely just like on Huawei smartphones and other huawei tablets in effect the fingerprint scanner supports and gestures just like smartphones and tablets form Huawei I already set it up you have to activate it in the settings and with those gestures for example if you press first one shortly it replaces the back button if you press longer it replaces the home button and if you swipe it replaces a recent Hef's buttons so that's why you don't see those three typical annual patterns here because I've already changed it to those gestures all right that's certainly nice and works very well I'm really used to that from other Huawei devices now let's take a look inside the device well I will tell you about the inside inside runs a Kiwi in 659 octo-core processor was a course and totally photos are clocked at up to 1.4 gigahertz and the other four add up to two point three six gigahertz and yeah together with that to beget three gigabytes of RAM and the 32 gigabyte of 32 gigabyte internal storage and that's a version that has been announced in Europe however on the website from Huawei in the spec sheet I saw that there will be a 4 gigabyte RAM in 64 gigabyte storage version that's not available yet and hasn't been announced yet and it's not really yeah so you might be able to get that in some countries and maybe everywhere in the future I already did a couple of benchmarks to support with the storage before I installed everything I took a screen shot and out of those 32 gigabyte at 21.9 one gigabyte free to use by yourself and I ran a couple of benchmarks and Geekbench phones the single core test I got 900 over 900 points and over 3600 and the mighty quest and in a tutu it got over 87 thousand points and those are much better than the Huawei media that m3 light em from last year and much better than the media pad t3 serious anyways yeah and pretty much better than most Android tablets I believe that cost under 300 u.s. dollars right now at least so that's pretty good and the internal hardware is identical to the Y media pad T 510 and said I had that I've been using for a couple of days already and I played players on a better world on that one and it run smoothly on the lowest and medium graphics settings so you should be able to play that on here as well because he displayed at least the resolution and the internal hardware has is same so that should run pretty good and here if we want to play it in HD graphics settings then you have to go one higher and go to the Huawei media pad m5 series alright that's about the performance now let's take a look at the operating system on here runs Android 8.0 overall and I can quickly confirm that in these settings over here it's Android 8.0 oil and on top of it runs the emotion UI invented in version 8.0 as well and it's pretty much identical to previous smartphones and also tablets from Huawei the interface looks identical to the media patent five series and pretty much to all predecessors as well so there are a lot of customizations here's a lot of apps pre-installed first of all there's no app drawer here don't worry you can get it back in the settings if you want to otherwise all apps are installed onto the home screen and again in the settings you can also turn on the gestures for the fingerprint reader it's not set up out of the box and as you can see already that a lot of apps pre-installed it several tools like calculator and so on the Microsoft apps games that flicks at children's corners pre-installed Facebook and poking dot-com and I install those benchmarks and a lot of Google Apps there's also a tablet been a jump where you can go to the battery setting and then activate a power saving mode and also as it's something called Smart resolution where the resolution will be lowered a bit to save battery so that might be nice also in the settings one thing that's quite important at least for me always was while with tablets if you use them if you set them up for the first time everything seems a bit too big and if you go to the display setting and then to View mode you can set it to small which I did already and then it looks yeah smaller and I would say normal so that's something that I always do was Warwick tablets the immediate had T 510 did not have this review mode setting but cm5 a light hand hazard so yeah that is great so that about the software one thing about the four speakers they sound really good I already watched a bit of YouTube on here and yes because I have a really good quality especially for the price so here's also force because it might be worth it I can't really show that in a video because I'm recording it with some mono microphone only it doesn't really represented anyways so maybe you can check it out in the store or something if the sound is important to you but it's really good and certainly better than most tablets that only have two speakers like Z 2018 iPad and also the media PT 510 speaking of watching something you might remember that we see why we meet up at m5 serious at the beginning you were not able to watch Netflix in HD that was fixed later with an update and with the immediate at m5 lighten yeah as you can see HD of full HD is running around bucks no update is needed if you ever want to test that on a tablet or smartphone or whichever device you can just open your Netflix app and put in test patterns and then you can run a couple of tests videos and they show you some data and here they show the resolution this is full HD and you know that's the screen of the tablet so that is great Netflix works fine alright let's take a look at the pen this is a pen and I showed it to you earlier and one thing that I noticed when I used it is that there's no button I believe with the standard M pen for the Huawei media paid him five pros there's a button and if you press it and press on here there are some shortcuts similar to what Samsung is offering with their commands for the Galaxy Tab s 3 S 4 and Z in note serious but you know it doesn't work because there's no pen here so I'm not sure if I will get it running for my final review I maybe I will read through the QuickStart guide for the stylus by the way you have to buy the pen separately and Germany I paid around 30 euros for it alright otherwise um yeah seems to be pretty nice pen it's nice and thick not as thin as some other pens and the pressure sensitivity certainly works and there a couple of apps pre-installed for the pen similar to the m5 pro one is my script calculator and that is a calculator app but with handwriting so you really sorted that you can do some handwriting here and then it calculates the result it can be complex at once and you are just calculates the result for you so that's certainly interesting maybe not useful for everybody but it works another app that's brilliant so Disney before Huawei by the way those apps you can also get them from the Google Play Store they're just brilliant sort here but I believe for this app you will have to pay I'm not sure if you have to pay here because I didn't sign in anything but I think it's included anyway this is a Notes app and you can have several notebooks and so on just like with other notes apps a special thing here is that you can just write something I will do it so you can write something and then hopefully it gets recognized my test never gets recognized anyway you can just write it and then you can for example procedure press convert all and then it's converted to computer text usually it should work pretty good especially if you have a kind of decent handwriting which I have not and by the way you can just put your whole time on here you can CERN right normally as well it should work at least yeah seems to work all right that's it that's what's pre-installed again there are no shortcuts however you can take a normal screen shot and then go to edit and then you can annotate it a bit however it works just like was all our devices so this is not a special pen feature but you can do it if you want otherwise you can download Autodesk SketchBook and so on from the Play Store Adobe apps or PDF annotating apps and then you use those one thing that is included is yeah you can see it already its handwriting recognition when you're using the pen and you're going to text field that's the handwriting recognition was opened automatically and then you can write here yeah my handwriting it's really late already it's really not that good it should work decently it's probably not as good as on Windows 10 or something which has really good handwriting recognition yeah but a short work fine I will certainly test out the stylus more for my final review yeah but as you can even see it here but it is pressure sensitive so if you prasada get a thicker line if you I'm not pressing I said it is a thinner line so yeah that works nicely alright my first impressions of you while we meet at that m5 flight 10 are pretty good I really like that we are getting a nice metal design yeah it's really a bit higher ends and the media pad T 510 which has a plastic bezel so really nice that we get a metal body here first because it seemed to be pretty good as well the screen is decent not super high resolution but Full HD is totally fine the performance should be fine for most people as well but if you want really better performance and you should check out the anomaly media pad m5 Sirius or the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 4 for example that will be much faster as well finger print scanner works nice if your stylus seems to be nice yeah seems to be a pretty nice tablet so far obviously have to review it more thoroughly there are a couple of interesting alternatives one is if you want to spend less money you don't need to pen you don't need to pay upon scanner and you can live with truth because only then you can check out the Wow immediate at T 510 I've got an unboxing video of that one up already and the review where follows soon the internal hardware answers Green pretty much identical same goes to software it just doesn't have those extra features for which you pay a bit more the immediate pati 510 and depending on the version cost 199 or 229 euros again there are no US prices yet and it's not available right now in the yes o Asia as I said earlier should be a really should be in a couple of weeks or maybe a month or so another alternative is obviously the huawei media pad m5 series the m5 f10 m5 Pro has a high evolution screen and better performance other features are similar with the m5 pro you can get a bit better pen but you also pay a lot more however there are also a lot of direct alternatives to the m5 like 10:1 is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 8 10.5 that will be released any day now it has a similar screen similar internal hardware and word array as well and if I remember correctly it has four speakers as well no fingerprint scanners though so yeah it will be really interesting alternative to this one especially since Samsung is a bit better was updates Huawei is really not that great especially but the tablet is concerned Samsung is a bit better and as a diver girl tentative will be Zenon over tab p10 that was just announced as well you can't buy it yet and nobody has seen it yet I won't seen in a couple of days at Aoife hopefully and that one has a similar display similar features fingerprint scanner forced because it has a metal frame but a glass bag similar to these Samsung Galaxy Tab s 4 and s 3 yeah but it has similar hardware so well some of the features overall so that might be nice alternative to if you really want the fingerprint scanner force because but don't want to spend as much money you can also check out the media pack m3 like 10 from last year cheaper the performance is much weaker but besides that and it's running new guard but besides that it's very similar so if you don't need that much performance and might be worth to check out save some money too alright I really have to start my review of C while we meet up at Empire tight end now and check it out further by the way this is only an unboxing not a review however once my review is up or whenever you want to you can always go to my neck tablo calm I will quickly show you and there I've got a section where's tablets I'm currently recommending and that one is always updated when I'm publishing a new view well at least of that tablet was worse to go and has the best section under the best section so I've got several lists was best tablets was keyboard space and what habits best tablets was a stylus and I'm remembering the iPad 2018 is a really nice alternative to this one too because prices are very similar features are very similar however there's a school is not laminated and it only has two speakers but it's an iPad and it will be certainly much longer up to date then why wait tablet is that's where we said Huawei yeah anyway if you are looking for tablets whenever you're watching this just go to my next a blogger come and is the best section and there you can check out my current recommendations and yeah I'm and Jade for my next tablet calm if you have any questions write me down below thanks for watching", "S7PqZWb7cBE": "[Music] it was at some point in the Bleak Midwinter I was fully snowed in for days and days I was doing calisthenics of some sort to keep the blood flowing and to keep my young live body finely tuned and active [Music] everything was going well and I was lost in the moment until [Music] [Music] hmmm looks like the people at hooli on send me something the fancy new pen maybe let's check it out initially swaddled in bubble wrap but arrived in a series of boxes that all seemed very nice but a little big for a pen maybe inside the box at first glance was a large smooth black surface may be some sort of desk top desk or drawing surface I didn't know but I was determined to find a pen there was in a side pocket hmm an interesting looking pen to be sure I can really good to write anything right off the bat it puzzled me there were a couple of buttons on the side a hole in the back top of it and the tip seemed to actuate as well and I couldn't actually see where the ink would come out back in the Box I found two cables one for the pen and one for what I later found out was a tablet and also some sort of miss proportion - tray looking thing in which were held replacement tips for the pen and some sort of mysterious metal ring barely able to contain my excitement through the unboxing process I finally removed the tablet and immediately began mashing the buttons with intensity with no result under the tablet were hidden a couple of user manuals which didn't interest me until much later and a nice microfiber lint-free cloth for wiping down the device with the usual thrill of new art supplies coursing through my veins I grabbed a piece of paper and set down to make some art nothing nothing happened though I realized I must be doing something wrong and shortly after consulting the manual I realized that none of this worked anything like I imagined and this was in fact a huion WH 1409 graphics drawing tablet which you got to plug into your computer I'm the type to read the manual as a last resort so it did take me a little bit of fiddling around with things to get it working but get it working I did for the most part it was plug-and-play I think when I plugged it in via USB it automatically downloaded the drivers from the internet stuff like that but I wasn't entirely aware that it did that and so I went searching for how to install drivers and the manual which I did end up looking at a couple times mentioned installing the drivers from a CD which I couldn't find in the box anywhere so I found them on the internet myself from their website install the drivers I started messing around with Photoshop and which I created ended up creating what you're watching now unfortunately I recorded in 720p so that might be a little bit blurry but I also was kind of zoomed in and enjoying the pixel enos of it that's another aspect anyways there's always just there's like a million different things to explore and figure out and get used to when it comes to drawing digitally anyways later when I was flipping the manual I also found out that this is a wireless tablet and once it's plugged in and charged to be a USB you know for a few hours you can unplug it and it should as the states of the manual lasts for about 40 hours of uninterrupted performance or drawing art-making via us via wireless wireless art making what am I saying anyways so I found a little after much searching and consternation I found a little USB dongle hidden behind a secret panel on the back of the tablet and I plug that into my computer to enable wireless capability and it turned out that that thing had all the drivers on it so it was also like a USB stick doubling as a wireless thing and it kind of blew my mind also the the pen of course is completely wireless you can plug it in every now and then but apparently the last months according to some reviews I've lat I've read online so I don't I'm not really worried about that this you know so this tablet does have a whole bunch of like buttons on the side which you can program with the little utility that comes with the drivers and you can adjust like the pressure sensitivity and it has all sorts of interesting features you can reprogram the little buttons on the sides of the on the side of the pen I didn't really I did reprogram a couple I didn't reprogram the buttons on the side of the pen I didn't mess with the buttons on the side of the tablet too much because I'm I'm already used to using keyboard shortcuts so I just kind of kept one hand my left hand up there on the keyboard kind of reached up and around and use my other hand to draw and I think what used to throw me off too much with the tablets I used to I did try to tablet once a long time ago and I didn't like it sold it almost immediately this time I'm having a little bit more fun with it what threw me off before was I was thinking about it as like a pen drawing and it's weird drawing down in your desk and looking up at the monitor of course but I think what makes it more useful to me and makes it make more sense in my brain is now that I have tried drawing on Photoshop and I've been doing stuff on Photoshop a little bit more just using my mouse I approach it just as a much more natural and useful way to use a mouse so I don't know I don't know if that makes any sense but I don't know I'm having a good time with it I'm looking forward to messing around with it a lot more and just seeing what I can get into not not by anime it's going to abandon my trim coat unquote traditional art making but it's just another fun thing to mess around with I suppose and I guess you can't can never run out of ink long as you don't run out of memory or electricity there's there's always something you can run out of I guess always anyways I'll see you guys later thanks for watching and I love you I do goodbye you",

I am Rob welcome to my channel. I see you guys have been doodling a lot. I absolutely love it I love all the enthusiasm And the participation you guys have been showing in our doodle everyday series you guys have been making amazing Doodles and sending them to me. I'm loving it Oh, by the way, if you don't know what I'm talking about Then you can head straight to my Instagram page and you can check it out. That's my handle and While you're there, please follow me. Also, you can follow me on my blog channel so I was going through all the comments on the doodling video on youtube and also on Instagram and what I noticed was that a lot of you mentioned that you guys are finding it a little difficult to draw with your finger on your phone and you want to know if there is A way to make a stylus at home. So guess what? I read your comments and guess what I fulfill your request So today we are making a homemade stylus. So get ready is time for some DIY why cuz I love it Why not? We're making a stylist at home and get better than that. Love it Alright guys, so let's make a stylus But before we make a salad, I'm gonna show you guys our stylus works using this ordinary pen Okay, so you can see this is a regular ordinary ballpoint pen But if this was stylus the body would be made of metal and it would have a conductive rubber or foam Tip somewhere you can draw write or operate your phone What happens is your body can store? Electrical charge static electricity and that is transferred through your finger through your mobile or tablet surface now that surface is Basically sensitive to that electrical charge and then you can operate it or you can write or draw So in a stylus the body is metal So you are transferring that electrical charge to the metal and through that metal it goes on to the conductive tip so what we have to do is you have to create or make a Similar setup or device that can basically take the charge from your hand to the tip So I'm going to show you guys how you can do that So now you can make a stylus using a regular pen or even a pencil, right? So I'm going to show you guys two different ones. So first we'll do with the pen. So like you can see here This is a regular ordinary ballpoint pen So what we'll do is first you'll remove the refill because we don't need that We are going to make a different tip So now we have just this plastic body now plastic is not a good conductor for electricity So we have to figure out how to transfer the charge for that. I am going to use some Electrical wire this is your regular electrical wire, which has a copper wire inside So I'm going to take a small piece from this wire to cut it. I am using regular scissors Now what we'll do is we'll make a small cut on this Now make sure when you're making this cut you don't cut through the copper wire we are just cutting The top layer which is this plastic cover relation And we will remove the installation There you go, you can see we have this Copper wire inside now for our stylus. We just need one strand so you can just pull one out Now we'll take one end of this wire and we'll bend it a little like this and we'll put it right here in this hole the tip of the pen and then take it to the other side flip it and then Put the other end Right here on the other end of the pin and Then we take this part and just lock it in place. Now, you can just twist it Okay, so you can see With a little bit of struggle I managed to push this in so now there is a copper wire running through the pin on the outside with one end going right here in The front hole the tip of the pen and the other end going on the back end Right here. So now what you have done is you have made this pin Conductive to the electrical charge and now the charge can transfer from your hand through this wire to the tip of the pen Now I am using this plastic pin. So I am doing this whole wire mechanism But if you manage to find a metal pin, then you don't need to do this all you need to do is make a tip and through that metal body the charge will transfer from your hand to the pin but Because it's very difficult to find a metal pin I went looking I couldn't find any So I'm showing you guys this alternate technique of using a plastic pin Now we need to make the tip now to make the tip I am going to use cotton This is just regular cotton So I'm gonna take a small piece maybe smaller than that and we will just roll it chilly even smaller and Now what you need to do is take some water And just dip your finger in water And then roll this again So what we're doing here is we are wetting the cotton a little bit because again water is a great conductor For electrical charge so let the cotton absorb the water a little bit Don't dip this in water. You need to apply very little water and now we will slowly push this inside a pin tip and once it is in you can just use the scissors again and Just cut it and shape it like A small tip. So now you have a small soft Conductive tip and you can use this like a stylus to operate your phone or draw on it. So let's test this out so here's my phone and Here's our stylist all you have to keep in mind is that you have to keep touching the wire at all time because that's how you are sending that static electrical charge from your body to this screen which is sensitive to that electrical charge and here I am in my Instagram app and Just try and draw with this Okay, that draws really smoothly Perfect So here we made a stylus out of a ballpoint pen And now I'm gonna show you guys how you can make a stylus out of a pencil. Let's do that All right So now I'm going to show you guys the second option how you can convert a pencil into a stylus now, obviously There is no hole here at the tip so you can't insert the cotton here so for that you have to figure out a different method what I feel, is that a Q-tip or an earbud is a very good alternative so what we'll do is we'll take an earbud and we will cut it so you can see I have the earbud here and a small piece of The plastic tube, maybe I should cut it slightly smaller Now we take the pencil and we will insert it in this plastic tube of pipe So they go now your pencil has a soft tip now you can see this won't stay here It's a little wobbly. So for that we will use some sticky tape and we will stick this in place Okay Nice and steady. So there you go. We have secured this in place now You can see we have a soft tip but the pencil is made of wood, which is not a good conductor So now to transfer that electrical charge we need Something metallic. So either you can use a wire or you can use some aluminum foil so here I have a piece of Some aluminum foil. This is your regular Aluminum foil that you use in your kitchen to wrap your food So you can just take a small piece of that and now we will Just roll it over the pencil, but what you have to keep in mind, is that the aluminum foil should touch? The tip of the your but basically touching the cotton because you want the charge to transfer from your hand to the aluminum foil and from the foil to the tip of the stylus, which is this cotton gear by Now we'll use some sticky tape and just secure it in place There you go and with that you have converted this pencil into a stylus Now before you start using it, you have to do the same thing You have to make this cotton a little more conductive and once the earbud is nice and wet Your stylus is good to go then all you need to keep in mind is and when you're holding it You should always be touching the aluminum foil because that's how the charge gets transferred to it And then from that to the cotton bud and your stylus will work. Let's test this out So there you go guys that's a cheap and simple way of making a homemade stylus I know it's not the best but it's great to start with and it's so simple, you know You can make it at home and it will definitely help you instead of using a finger now You can hold a pencil or a pen and have a better grip of drawing some doodles So now I'll be waiting for some more amazing and awesome goals from you guys So if you enjoyed watching this video and found this tutorial helpful Then don't forget to give this video a big thumbs up like it share it with your friends and subscribe to my channel You know the deal right and if you're following me here, and also, please follow me on my blog channel subscribe to that too there That's it guys.

Once fully charged, remove the USB Type-C cable from the pen and slide the cover back into place. The tilt pen has two buttons located near the bottom. By default, the top button is used to select an item or to perform right-click functions. The bottom button is used to erase. Depending on the application, these button functions might vary. The tilt pen also comes with replacement tips. To replace the tip, pull straight out to remove the used tip. Insert the replacement tip into the pen until it stops. The HP rechargeable MPP2.0 tilt pen is now ready to use with your PC.", "RDSNIsqLTbA": "i've had a lot of questions asking whether it's possible to replace the s6 lite s pen tip because it's a slightly softer nib that might wear out eventually and some people have had problems with them splitting over time however samsung doesn't include any replacement tips in the box so what are you supposed to do when it breaks so today i'm going to test once and for all whether it's possible to replace the s6 lite pen tip with replacement tips for the fully fledged s6 this kit cost me about six pounds and is absolutely tiny you can see that it contains what looks like a removal instrument to pull out the tip that came with the pen and we can see two replacement tips on the inside a white one and a black one i'm led to believe that the black one is a softer nib just like the one that's already in there and the white one a more plasticky harder tip with less give it's nice that whether you're into white or black tips there's something for everyone here right let's not waste any more time will a replacement s6 pen tip fit into the s6 light stylus firstly we'll use the tool to remove the black tip there's a small circular groove in one side which presumably latches on and i will gently pull this out so yep easily enough that's come right out and we'll put it here for safe keeping now let's try to insert the white one just so you can see that i'm not pulling any tricks let's pick up the white tip slide it in and push it into place and there we go i was kind of expecting a click or something but it does seem to be seated in there okay success then guys we have successfully replaced the tip now all that remains is to test it so now that i've grabbed my tab s6 light let's load up the notes app and have a little doodle and amazing this seems to be working as normal the white tip definitely has more resistance than the black one feels substantially harder and drags on the screen less i also quickly want to test it in an art app this is art flow the app that i use generally for drawing just to check that the pressure sensitivity behaves how it should and yes thankfully exactly as normal so there we go guys job well done you can replace the s6 lite s pen tip with replacements for the s6 and it can be done inexpensively and i will leave a link to the product i've used in the description below if this video has helped you out i'd really appreciate a like so that more people can see it and consider subscribing to the channel and checking out my full review of the s6 lite along with my guide to taking digital notes with it have a great day [Music] you", "_006XBqWi0A": "okay so that's the hp x 360 and the nv in the 2020 amd version with uh the ryzen 7 4700u inside i promised you guys that i'm going to show you a couple of things regarding the the pen the hp tilt pen that is available uh through the hp store and online it comes with a couple of accessories there is a small kind of a cable is there a cable no i don't think there's a cable but there's a manual and there are a few extra tips uh plastic tips that you can use for the for the pen just pull pull this out and you're going to be able to um replace these there's a box over here however when i bought this pen it was the newest one and the fanciest one right now i reckon there's a newer version available on the market basically this one has got only one button here and the new version it's a different shape and it's got two buttons like an up up and down button here however this one has got a additional button here at the back and it functions um also as a kind of a remote there are two different modes that you can um enter using this pen and apart from this being a button over here it's also a a eraser so it's like a pencil you're you're writing with this end and if you make a mistake you can just cross it out the new one the newer one that is available on hp website doesn't seem to have this element so i don't know if i want to buy the new one because i like this eraser function and i use it a lot this particular model is s pen hp03 active stylus it's supposed to be a a tilt pen a tilt pen so apart from having the newest windows ink technology it's uh pressure sensitive and also uh tilt kind of sensitive however i do have a couple of problems with this um i'm going to show it to you later when you just twist it a little bit you twist this part and you raise it up and there's a usbc charging port here so uh you can charge the pen up some people say that oh you have to charge it every day however no if you use it just for a few i don't know minutes a few um minutes every day then i reckon it lasts like a week or something so you don't have to charge it every day if you use it not too often so okay guys let's just clean this up a little bit and fired the fire the hp envy let's do a quick quick boot here okay i think it's already up and running i wanted to show you the the color shift that happens when you um power on the device look at the screen uh hold on let me focus a little bit okay and yeah look at the screen and look at the now yeah it's it's there it's apparent there was a color shift it's because the screen is not calibrated out of the box and it's got a like a greenish yellowish tint uh to it so i calibrated mine and during every um windows logon you have to i mean you have to you don't have to it's just switching colors also when you install new um amd adrenaline drivers it also resets the color uh setting to a stock so you have to do the calibration again okay so let's fire up uh photoshop and i'm gonna show you um some features of this of this pen i didn't manage to make it work when it comes to the tilt uh functionality i know that you have to have this button pressed in so it's going to register the pressure sensitivity of um of the pen i do have a couple of brushes here i don't know let's choose this one or maybe this one and yeah it's uh when it's close to the screen and you touch it very gently it doesn't register anything you have to hold it a bit more hold it a bit deeper i see i'm pressing very gently gently very gently and it's very tiny tiny when i press it harder harder harder it goes automatically to a another brush shape and size so that's that's good however it doesn't register you know every time when i when i do some some minor movements uh it's it doesn't catch up i need to make sure it's pressed in a little bit so that you know defies the um the whole point of of having a very tight very tight pressure sensitivity let's see see it's it's wood the screen is capable of doing it i don't know if something's wrong with the pen it doesn't register and sometimes it does register and sometimes when i press it very hard it changes completely so uh the pressure sensitivity is working however i didn't find any tilt tilt option here uh in in photoshop i was trying to research do some research on the internet trying to find what's what the heck is going on however i was not able to do any kind of change in in the brush when you tilt it or not tilt it when you tilt it or not tilted only pressure sensitivity only pressure very gently gently and sometimes when you're too gentle it doesn't register at all so i think something's maybe wrong with the pen or it's not completely i don't know maybe calibrate it maybe somebody abused it over i don't know whatever it fell down or something but it's like it's what texture scattering dual brush there are no settings for any tilt i've been in the settings in here and i can't see any any major settings about the tilt functionality however the palm rejection look i'm touching i'm touching the screen with my palm so yeah everything's fine i can still type and draw and do some uh minor movement as well so it's all it's all fine uh the palm rejection works words works quite well and it i'm using it a lot for example when i'm signing some sort of documents i don't know let's do a um let's open a file let's open a file for example jpeg okay let's open this one up for example yeah it's there so you when you bring the tip of the pen close to the screen it enables this kind of editing mode and you just click on the option you like and you can just write or sign a document if you don't like it or made a mistake you can easily erase all the bits that you that you've done for example like so and this is also pressure sensitive here i'm try typing gently gently gently and hard hard hard so it the pressure sensitivity also works here in photos it's like a stock stock stock app for ford uh for windows and yeah going back to photoshop uh sure the eraser also works i'm sure you can change the amount of erasing the size of the eraser however i like this function a lot and the new pen doesn't seem to have this function so i don't know if i'm supposed to buy it or not so for my needs you know if i'm just signing the document without being really really gentle although sometimes i would really like to be gentle and i would really like to be able to see the pen reacting and the screen reacting to the pen being so close only just gently touching only just gently smudging it doesn't recognize see i i see that it is possible because oh yeah i see it is possible to create a tiny tiny very tiny movement but it's it's difficult not to press it that hard because either you press it or it doesn't register so uh yeah but generally it works fine i like it i like it a lot you can sign things with it i think i'm gonna try the the new version of the pen maybe they changed something maybe i don't know this pen is defective i'm gonna keep using it anyway it's still got the sticker it's still got stickers uh so yeah let me know what you think about this um how would you use the pen how would you um interact with this by the way this is my case here on the side i'm going to do maybe a review on this diy case for my ryzen 7 it's a quite nice build so maybe later in the next video thanks a lot for watching and yeah see you later cheers", "2K71t5yGyjk": "[Music] hey guys this is Claudio Giuliano here and today I'm excited to be coming at you with this new review and today we are reviewing the new Microsoft Surface slim pen so this is Microsoft's latest pen design that comes with the surface pro X but it's also compatible with other generations of the surface pro so this is compatible with the pro 5 with the pro 6 and the pro 7 I wanted to review it for you guys and I also wanted to check it out for myself and see how it felt see how this design impacts the overall drawing experience with the surface so I'm gonna be testing it with the surface pro 6 today we're gonna draw we're gonna sketch we're gonna paint and we're gonna see if this 150 dollar pen is worth buying because it's the same exact input technology as all previous generations just pretty much in a new casing however what I found in testing this slim pen is the new design does make a bit of impact for drawing and sketching and painting and later in the review I'm gonna point some of those things out I'm gonna point out some of the reasons I do actually like the new slim pen so we're starting with the hardware and it is comfortable in hand it's ergonomic in hand and it's very lightweight it's a high-end build it has a really nice sleek look to it we have our top button which is also the eraser we have our bottom button here which is also a lot easier to access versus the round pen so I find the button placement on the slim pen to be a lot more ergonomic now the eraser is pretty much exactly the same as far as feel on screen goes and function it just looks a bit different here and overall we have a really nice sleek design and I am finding it to be organic when I work with it so the new surface slim pen doesn't have batteries this is a rechargeable pen so unlike the pro-x where it charges in the keyboard cover Microsoft includes this dock with the pen so you can charge it this is USB C 2 USB a and the pen also magnetically attaches into the stock and when it's plugged in it will start charging I'm finding the battery life to be quite long it has lasted multiple days I don't think it's going to be as long as the battery system in the 4k surface pen the round one where you can go here and it's still on 88% but I am still finding the battery life to be good and there's an indicator on the pen that tells you when you need a charge now I have a couple other pens in here I wanted to do a general comparison just to show you the size and the shape difference we have the Apple pencil which is longer than all three here we have the round surface pen the 4 K surface pen and I also wanted to bring in the Adhan it's snap because it has a similar flat design however it's more flat than the surface slim pen the surface limp pen is kind of more rounded in its flatness it's kind of a weird thing you have to kind of hold it and see it in person so it is a bit more round than the Adana snap here it is directly compared to the 4k round surface pen so very different when it comes to design and a completely different tip design as well so different eraser design different tip design now where the erasers feel the same where a big differences is in how the tips feel and I'm going to go into detail when we start working on that so this is the same exact pen technology as the other round pen there's no differences in the technology we only have differences in design but some of the design differences make impact on drawing sketching and painting and I would say one of the biggest areas that make impact for this is in its overall design and this new tip design the new tip reminds me of the Apple pencil and a mixture of the Adana ink Pro that we reviewed a while back I think the surface pen gets a worse wrap then it deserves in some examples out there you can watch them and it will look like it's the worst input technology out there and a while back it was it really was one of the worst but when they developed the 4k pen it got a lot better and it has improved with updates over time it's gotten a lot better so when you are seeing those examples that's usually in a software that doesn't really understand input interpretation and it's also in a software that is not fully set up for the pen giving you a very half-baked experience when it comes to the input but when you're working in something that is fully set up for a like clip studio paint you're going to get a good experience and if you compare this experience back and forth with an experience that is not fully set up for the pen that is giving you a half-baked experience with the pen you're going to see a really big difference between the two so I feel that's important to know about the surface pen know this is not going to be the first experience I grab and go to for drawing sketching painting or inking you guys know the Apple pencil is my gold standard for good reason along with Wacom technology I've gone over those reasons a lot so you guys know why but when I do only have the surface on me I still am able to get an enjoyable working experience with the pen and there's plenty of times where I am illustrating on the surface and I have no problems at all when it comes to the actual input technology now back to the tip design one area where this new tip design really comes through is for inking that exercise I was doing before going thick to thin with the lines that is something I'm not able to do with the round pen and the rubberized tip that is something that I'm able to do with this new pen design and this do tip so that was exciting for me because that's kind of always the experience I wanted to get with the surface here when it comes to my line and ink work so I definitely prefer this for inking and this is also a different tip than the triangular tip that comes in the surface pen tip kit different feel on screen and a different design makeup so I am just doing some stuff on the spot here improvised and what I want to show you with this is the precision of this tip this new tip design when I'm going in for the detail the way that the dispersion of pressure is happening from thick to thin when I go in for the really fine detail you can see that that's all coming through really nicely here there were no setbacks when I was doing this piece here going in for the way that I ink from thick to thin with varied pressure you know everything came through nicely so I didn't have any frustrations when I was working with this pen and I have run into frustrations with the round pen because of how that particular design is there are different styles I implement for ink where I do still like the round pen and it's overall feel but also the way that that tip feels because it starts to kind of feel like a brush so there are areas where I like that but for precision inking for going in with very fine detail I would probably nine times out of ten choose the new slim pen over the round pen and the stock tip for inking so I got a really nice experience with this new pen for laying down varied pressure ink and I really enjoyed it and I also really enjoyed the button placement when I need to drag the canvas around the placement of the button lands in a much better spot for that so jitter is something that is often brought up when it comes to the surface pen this is not something that has ever gotten in the way of my work even when it was really bad in the probe three days because the jitter is only apparent on diagonals when you draw really slow when you're drawing at a normal speed that is not apparent at all there is no jitter and again it's only on the diagonals but as you can see here when I'm drawing slowly on this diagonal and this is also with stabilization off you can see the jitter is really reduced so they've done good work with reducing the jitter it's not completely gone but when you're working in a software set up for the pen the jitter is even more reduced so now I want to just lay down some quick stuff for paint and we're gonna compare some things back and forth with the round pen so with the new slim pen it is still nice to paint with but we do have this harder tip so it's given a very different feel verse the field you might be used to with the round pen with the stock rubber tip but what I really like about the round pen with the stock tip is it begins to kind of feel like a brush and there are some other differences so I'm gonna bring in the round pen now and one thing that's in parent is it does feel like it has a little bit less of an initial activation force it feels like the paint is coming out a little bit easier and I believe that is strictly due to the difference in the hardness of the tip so that's one thing that's apparent but this stock tip that's in the round pen has a really brush like feel and that's something I still very much enjoy about the round pen each of these pens have a very different feel when you are working with them while they are the exact same input technology the design of each is very different and when you compare them directly back and forth those design differences do come through and it does change the overall feel of the experience so design does go a long way when it comes to a pen I do find both to be comfortable in organ AMA can hand in one area the slim pen is more ergonomic because of its button placement so if you do use that button a lot I think you will end up prefer the slim pen over the round pen but at the end of the day it really comes down to personal preference there are some drawbacks of the slim pen if you are using it with the pro five six or seven and that's in integration and pen storage it's a less integrated experience verse the round pen while you can attach the slim pen to the side of the machine magnetically in other areas it's nowhere near as strong of a hold that you get with the round pen whereas with the Pro X you are able to store the slim pen in the keyboard cover which also doubles as the charging method using it with other compatible machines means you have to charge the pen externally with the included charging dock however the Pens battery does last a long time and it lasts multiple days so you wouldn't have to carry the doc around with you so all around I do like the new surface slim pen it feels good in the hand it has a good button placement it's ergonomic it's enjoyable to work with most of all I really enjoy the new tip design I enjoy the way that that feels when working with it for drawing painting and sketching it is something I can recommend it's definitely a good design and it's a nice product but if you already have the round Fork a surface pen being that this pen is a hundred and fifty dollars it's hard for me to recommend that you just go out and buy it unless you do a lot of drawing and illustrating with your surface and you want to have a different feel with that experience I would say the most disappointing thing about the slim pen is the price being that it is the exact same input technology as the round Fork a surface pen you're just getting a different design in casing Walt the design does make impact for when you are working with it especially with that new tip designs I still don't feel like that was enough to justify the really high price tag of the slim pen however that's how these things work unfortunately things tend to go up and guys I want to

daily and in this video we're going to be checking out the new samsung galaxy s21 ultra this is of course the biggest most feature packed most expensive s21 in the lineup and i'm really excited to see what it has to offer now you might already know that the s21 ultra this year also offers s pen support kind of like the note series and i've got the s pen silicone case combo accessory here as well so lots to check out but first things first let's just quickly unbox this phone and see what comes inside this new slim packaging if you didn't already know samsung really minimized the box and included accessories for the entire s21 lineup this year inside the box here the first thing we get is a little sheet that says samsung on it and underneath that is the phone itself i obviously got mine in phantom black which i think looks really cool we'll set it to the side for just a second and digging a little deeper inside the box you can see that there's not much else that's included there's a small little packet here with the sim ejector tool attached to the outside and inside you get a stack of paperwork and a usbc cable and that's it like i said no other included accessories anymore even on this super expensive s21 ultra so here is the phone itself once again and if this matte black finish doesn't do it for you there's also phantom silver and some exclusive colors like titanium navy and brown that are all made to order so they'll take like six to eight weeks to be delivered but if you want something more unique you can definitely have that with this phone and for the most part the new s21 ultra looks kind of similar to previous samsung flagship devices but there are a couple of new features add-ons and interesting things worth mentioning first off in regards to the size the s21 ultra is the largest phone in the lineup this year by just a little bit it's a 6.8 inch device which certainly puts it on the upper end of the smartphone size spectrum and if you're curious here is what the ultra looks like stacked up against the s21 plus and the regular s21 now interestingly enough the difference isn't so drastic up against the s21 plus that phone is 6.7 inches so just a tiny bit smaller height wise but both these phones are pretty close honestly they're about the same width and thickness obviously just big devices in general you don't really get a difference until you jump down to the 6.2 inch s21 that phone feels almost small in comparison though it's still kind of big in its own right and really this year with all these phones being well above six inches you're kind of stuck deciding between a big device or a really big device that's pretty much the lineup this time around up front the s21 ultra obviously shares the same center hole punch camera cutout design and super slim bezels that we've seen on plenty of other samsung flagships before but one other interesting design cue worth noting is that the ultra actually has a slight curve to the front glass and display and that's not something you get on the regular s21 or s21 plus it's super subtle just along the edges you might not even notice if you didn't know to look for it and fortunately to me it doesn't feel too different in the hand i don't find myself like accidentally touching the display on either side because of it i know not a lot of people like the curved edge on the smartphone displays nowadays so that's why i wanted to mention it but to me i think it's subtle enough to not really be an issue around back the s21 ultra gets an all glass rear panel you get that on the s21 plus as well but not on the cheaper regular s21 on this phone though it's not any nicer or more premium of a material it's the same sort of soft matte finish frosted glass that we've seen before and the rest of the phone the outside edge and the frame that's a polished aluminum which i think looks really nice and that is the same material and design as the entire rest of the s21 lineup so all in all you're not really getting any better materials or a different design in going with the ultra it's pretty much the same samsung flagship you're familiar with and that you'd get with most other models as well taking a look around there's nothing on the left side of the phone there not much up top either just some microphone holes on the right are your usual power and volume buttons on the bottom there's a sim card tray that's just a sim card tray now no expandable storage here on these phones anymore which is kind of a bummer there's the usbc charging port and speaker down there as well up front there's a secondary speaker in the earpiece for stereo sound and the out loud listening experience on this device is really great here's a quick sample so you can get an idea [Music] now around back the camera setup there is probably the thing that stands out most about this s21 ultra and for good reason it's quite the setup you've got a 108 megapixel main lens a couple 10 megapixel telephoto lenses for crazy zoom capabilities there's an ultra wide lens some additional sensors for video stabilization and i'll go more in depth with all that in just a second but i do just want to point out that physically while the lenses are bigger and there are some additional ones and sensors and things the camera module on this phone isn't as obnoxious as it maybe was last year on the s20 ultra it sticks out about as much as the other s21 devices now it is still quite a bit wider though and in the hand i do think i noticed that sort of top heavy feel you might get with potentially some extra weight from the chunky camera setup it's not bad the phone isn't gonna like slide out of my hand because of it but it is something that i do notice with this whole thing so i figured i'd just point that out so we'll get back to the phone in just a minute but one of the new sort of features or supported accessories i guess with the s21 ultra this year is the s pen and this is an interesting potential edition to say the least now you don't get an s pen with the s21 ultra you have to go out and buy it separately it costs like forty dollars just for the pen itself for seventy dollars you can get a pen and case combo like this which might make a little more sense this is the silicone cover case directly from samsung and inside the package you get the case itself obviously the new rather large s pen to go with it and actually sort of hidden inside the box there's also an additional s pen tip and removal tool so don't forget to look out for that before throwing away the box and there's also this little diagram that shows you how to insert and remove the s pen from the case which to be honest was more helpful than i thought because the setup maybe isn't as intuitive as i would have liked the case itself is just your average silicone protective case it's a soft touch rubbery material with a hard inner shell and it pops on the phone pretty easily all in all a decent case setup that i think offers plenty of protection for the phone itself so no complaints there and on the side of the case is where you can store the s pen now the s pen only goes in the case one way tip down inserted first and then you kind of click the top end into place if you try to put it in any other way it obviously just doesn't work and what's kind of weird is that the s pen isn't totally round it has a flat profile but if you put it in the case adjacent to how it should go in a little crooked maybe it's suddenly more difficult to pull back out again so that's a little weird now the whole case and s pen setup obviously adds quite a bit of size and bulk to an already quite large device the width of this whole setup is just crazy now it sort of feels like you're holding a whole book in your hand and to be totally honest the whole thing is fine i don't have a lot of complaints about it but i think this whole thing is probably best set up for left-handed folks obviously the pen is on the left side of the case when you're looking at the phone from the front and for someone right-handed like me i haven't really found the fastest way to sort of get the s pen out and start writing i either have to crisscross my hands or shuffle everything around or maybe start with the phone turned around completely it's a little awkward but it's probably the first time a right-handed person has ever felt inconvenienced by something i guess i can kind of feel for left-handed people after this experience now this new s-pen obviously is quite a bit larger than the s pen on the note 20 for example this thing is almost the size of like a regular pen or pencil really it's got that flat profile like i mentioned which i think makes it a little more comfortable there's no top clicky button or anything there there is however a clickable side button but it actually has far less functionality than you might expect which i'll explain in a second the tip is a very sharp pointed pressure sensitive setup and all in all it's the stylus setup you'd expect from samsung there's no real surprises here as far as the features and functionality with the s21 ultra it's basically identical to the note series you've got the shortcut panel that pops up when the phone recognizes that the pen is nearby and you have quick access to written notes a coloring book smart select ar doodle translate live messages all the usual s pen stuff you already know and love it looks to be all the same as the note series you can also of course just utilize the s pen to tap touch and swipe your way through the phone as well which i know a lot of people like to do and the writing experience is smooth fast and accurate just like you'd expect the stylus is of course made for the phone and vice versa so you have the nearly seamless and lag free writing experience that i think samsung is known for on these products which is great so a couple other important things to mention with this whole setup if you want to just use the stylus by itself and not have the case installed at all on the phone that's fine you can do that the case isn't connected to the phone or the stylus or anything like that the stylus is just automatically recognized when it's very close to the screen of the phone and this stylus only works with the s21 ultra you can't buy it and use it with the s21 plus or regular s21 for example it isn't compatible and won't be recognized so if you want this stylus you have to buy the ultra and one other thing to go over this current s pen stylus isn't one of the fancy new bluetooth enabled ones with like ar gestures and additional button controls for selfies and things samsung says that stylus which they're going to call the pro version with the bluetooth features isn't coming until later this year this current stylus does have a side button with like super limited functionality it's sort of just like an additional select button when it's very close but not quite touching the display but yeah not much more than that so while it's very much a high-end samsung stylus as it is it isn't the totally smart really fancy bluetooth stylus from the current generation note devices all in all this is an interesting if not sort of confusing add-on for this device i'm not quite sure at this point if it's worth it i'll have to use it a bit more but in my eyes this add-on i think might be signaling the end of the note series altogether which i think is kind of a shame so jumping back to the phone itself here there are just a couple of other things i do want to go over first off the massive 6.8 inch display is a dynamic amoled panel that offers both 120 hertz and 1440p resolution simultaneously if you remember last year the samsung phones that offered a high refresh rate option and 1440p resolution like the s20s they made you choose one or the other this year the s21 ultra allows to have both at the same time and i think this is just a phenomenal looking display with all the highest settings enabled you get a 3200 by 1440 resolution at 515 pixels per inch 1500 nits of max brightness and it's probably the best display setup on the market right now given everything it offers while it is a shame that the lower s21 and s21 plus devices don't get the higher resolution at all i think if you're going to offer it having it paired with 120 hertz altogether is the way to go and i can sort of see why samsung offered it just on this s21 ultra it's really great and honestly might be one of the most enticing sets of features about this phone underneath the display is a brand new fingerprint setup as well you do get this on the other s21s and it's just so incredibly quick you barely even need to tap your finger on the display and it opens right up it's really good and a noticeable significant improvement over previous years there's also face unlock as well and that too is very fast inside the s21 ultra obviously packs the latest 2021 specs as do all of these new samsung flagship phones but you do get a little more in going with this phone instead the processor is going to be the same either the snapdragon 888 or the qualcomm 2100 but you can get 12 or 16 gigs of ram versus just eight on the other s21s and up to 512 gigabytes of internal storage so you can really spec this thing out if you want obviously it's already gonna be a lightning fast and incredibly powerful device anyway but there's a ton of potential here to maybe make this one of the most powerful devices you can buy there's also a slightly larger battery inside this phone as well versus the rest it's a 5 000 milliamp capacity now if you run the 1440p resolution with the high refresh rate at max brightness the extra battery certainly won't matter you'll probably even get worse battery life than the rest of the s21s honestly at that point but potentially this s21 ultra might be able to last just as long or maybe a little longer than the rest under the right conditions and finally let's just briefly talk about all those cameras around back now i'm obviously gonna have some dedicated videos and camera comparisons coming soon but the setup on this phone i think is not only just really ridiculous but much more refined than last year's s20 ultra as well there are a lot of things you get on this phone that you do get on other devices now including the 8k video recording but you're gonna get things like enhanced video stabilization way more potential with the powerful main lens for every shot and of course there's the 100 times zoom and just taking a quick sample shot here with all that zoom in my opinion this is a much improved and way more usable sort of setup than last year and i'm really excited to put it to the test also the selfie camera on this phone is quite a bit better than the other s21s as well you get a 40 megapixel lens up front on this phone and the results here look amazing as well all in all i'm really looking forward to putting this phone to the test in the coming weeks to see what it is capable of so there you go those are all of my initial thoughts and first impressions on this new s21 ultra what do you

another one of these top down things because i'm finding it easier to show stuff this way so what we've got today is obviously this is a 12.9 ipad pro it's the fourth gen this isn't an apple pencil now i know you can get what the crayon and maybe a couple of other apple pencil variants this one is by zag the people who make the uh protectors for your cell phones and such they also do some rugged cases well this is the zag pro stylus it's just come out like literally i don't even see it listed on zag or on any store online as yet so i can't leave a link for it but this is 69.99 or it's going to be 69.99 this works with both the ipad and the ipad pro now when i say the ipad i mean the 6th gen the 7th gen i'm assuming the 8th gen it's also going to work with the first two generations of ipad pro as well as the newer 2018 ipad pro and the 2020 ipad pro that we've got here the third and fourth gen so unlike the apple pencil this covers all the ipad devices that have got apple pencil compatibility which is really nice so let's just talk through a few points it says on the back of here so has tilt recognition palm rejection the tips are replaceable you get full day battery life has a battery level indicator and type c charging so yeah everything covered there hopefully it's as good or close to being as good as the apple pencil anyway get one year warranty on this div thing as well so everything's looking good so far but let's get into this and see what it's like i've not even touched it yet literally just come in the mail so this is a first look it's not a review or anything like that can't review something in 20 minutes so obviously it's a child proof box how the hell do i get in this thing wow here we go so the top so it slides open you clip where it's hanging is there that is not where you undo it it slides from the bottom all right and it's in this little foam so there's the pen it actually feels a lot like the apple pencil i actually like it as well because it's more space gray with the black tip and i've just gotten there oh i see it's also got the rubber point so you can use this with pretty much anything when it comes to doing it that way but yeah it's quite nice so far see what else we get in here let's lift up this insert all right there we go you get usbc cable and then you get a replacement tip there big tip it's like literally the whole tip thank you can you see that it's like the entire tip is replaceable so let's go back over there with this put that out of the way quick start guide powering it on your pro stylus is charged and ready to use right out the box turn it on and off simply push the power button so there's a power button on this here it's right there i don't know if you can see that let's see you see that there's a power button right here so let's turn this baby on there you go see the white light this is now powering up using your pro style let's turn on the stylus right and draw whatever so that is on right now i believe so let's bring over the ipad and see what happens so what have we got here i've not even set this ipad up properly yet yep yep notes well if it loads in yeah look at this man used to work for apple and he's still got all his notes from when he trained so yeah let me tell you they don't talk to you off the top of their head let me just tell you they have like introduction to selling the iphone and the upgrade program and things to say to people customer engagement but anyway let's not get into that because i might get in trouble let's write a new note so it's fast it's super responsive if you're wondering why my i've heard making that noise like pencil on paper i've got one of the paper-like screen protectors on there and i do right neat in this normally let's put my palm on here there you go hit like and subscribe so when you turn the thing over it doesn't do a lot on that that's just a basic stylus use for anything else so let's get rid of all this all right well it works really well it's very very very active and feels just as good as the ipad let's come out of that and let's see if there's uh something else we can use so let's try it on lumafusion this is pencil the apple pencil is great with lumafusion it makes it so much easier let me turn that brownness down a little bit so you can see a little easier how's that there you go so william fusion it makes it so much easier to just if i want to cut back and cut there and i'll cut there and i can take that piece out it's so much quicker using the apple pencil and now i can use it with this as well so it's just like using a mouse in a way but it just makes things that much quicker this video was the one i released yesterday about the case that i uh got for the z-fold two but yeah so it works great with lumafusion not a problem there i'm happy with that let's see if we go to out of the transitions select photos yeah it's i mean it's super fast let's see if it magnets to the top of the device yep there it goes just like the apple pencil it's a strong magnet as well it's not coming off almost it but i mean if you're going to shake your ipad like that you might want to go and see somebody because you've got a problem anyway let's see what else we can do with it so i just want an activated scribble so scribble does work with this as you can see i'm on man united.com yes i know my team got stomped on sunday 6-1 let's not talk about it i also know we had a dire transfer window deadline day as well so yes leave me be i'm already depressed anyway scribble does work on this you can see up there it's manchester united etmanunited.com so let's say i go you tube and just leave it bang see there it is youtube and let's try sky sports dot com there it is instantly recognizes it yeah whatever let's try something else um twitter dot-com there we go all good even though i typed twixtor yeah but yeah scribble works on it that works just fine but yeah for just basic usages using as a stylus things like that it works really well i would say i want to get into it a little bit more i just wanted to give you a first look at this it's 69.99 i'll do a review on it after i've used it for a few days personally so far the fact that it works with lumafusion just makes it such a a good thing for me i can get through my editing so much faster with an apple pencil and i didn't really want to go out and shell 130 for an apple pencil so yeah 69.99 i'll do another video soon and give you a full review but so far seems promising all right guys catch you in the next one bye", "7ymxTOnRBo0": "the iPad doesn't need a stylus Apple built its tablets that you don't need anything more than your finger to control it that's great if you're browsing the web checking Facebook or ordering seamless but if you want to draw or write on your iPad you're gonna want to stylus we're used to writing drawing and painting with something in our hand and a great stylus gets close to replicating that it should also make creating art a lot more fun a good stylist does three things it's easy to use it works with a lot of apps and it draws exactly what you want it to that's why the best outs you can get is the sensu artist brush and stylus the sense who doesn't use Bluetooth or require a battery so it can work in any app and delivers the most natural and consistent results of any stylus I tested what I love about this sensitive stylus is its rubber tip it has a really smooth glide over the iPad screen but it also has just the tiniest grab to it that makes it feel like you're actually writing on something this is going to sound really simple but the other great thing about the Setsu stylus is that it actually works pretty much every time you use it as long as you apply the slightest amount of pressure while writing or drawing the sensi stylus is going to make a line which is more that could be said for a lot of other styluses even better the big rubber tip means you can use it from a lot of different angles and even use the side of the stylus for shading that's a big reason why the sense who gets an edge over close competitors like a d\u00f6nitz jot Pro and jot mini they're both really natural to hold and use but you're stuck writing straight down coming from an angle and you're out of luck the job may be a touch better for handwriting for the iPad just isn't cut out for that kind of precision the other really cool thing about the sensitive stylus is that when you pop off the back there's a brush underneath that you can use to simulate painting it's really helpful for when you need to fill in large areas and it's surprisingly great for doing other things in painting navigating menus with a brush is strangely fun the brush doesn't have the same precision as the rubber tip but it's a great option to be able to switch over to a basic stylus will get the job done just fine for most people but if you need some more powerful features like palm rejection or pressure sensitivity you can find that with a Bluetooth stylus before you get too excited you should know that Bluetooth styluses are going to be bumping into the iPads limitations even more than regular styluses it just doesn't build to work with them you'll have to deal with some small frustrations every now and then but you can absolutely get better results if that's something you need then you should get it down it's jot touch the jot touch is a Bluetooth stylus that offers customizable buttons palm rejection and supposedly over 2,000 levels sensitivity being able to make your lines thicker or thinner depending on how much pressure you're applying is a huge time-saver no more digging around in menus every time you need to change a setting it takes a bit of getting used to but once you have the rhythm down it'd be a lot more powerful than a regular stylus the other big bonus to the drop touch is it's two customizable buttons you won't be able to take advantage of these in every app but in a few apps you'll be able to set them up to do a bunch of different commands like undoing a stroke switching over to the eraser or pulling up a menu the jot touch is also supported by a lot of the best writing and drawing apps out there like procreate and adobe draw online when an app doesn't support it that's fine too as long as the jot touch is connected to the iPad you can draw with it it just works like any other basic stylus the one thing you will want to watch out for is that the jot touch doesn't work perfectly with the iPad air - every once in a while it just stops drawing mid stroke it's not a complete deal-breaker if you have some patience but it is annoying it's an issue that you'll run into with other high-end styluses right now - the jot touch also does palm rejection but like the other Bluetooth stylus as I test it it's really hit and miss good palm rejection would be a huge deal we're used to writing with our hands on a sheet of paper after all but the iPads touchscreen just does not want to let that happen that's why if you do choose a Bluetooth stylus you should definitely choose one with pressure sensitivity there are some good Bluetooth options that just do palm rejection like a doughnut zone jot script and fifty threes pencil but for a little more money you can get a jot touch and do a lot more although I do wish every size with copy pencils eraser feature with so many stylus options for the iPad it's the small differences that make or break them at the end of the day you really just want something consistent that's why Ciencias artists brush and stylus is the best stylus you can buy", "KbDTmvs0aIs": "[Music] hey friends welcome to Pearson comprehensive like my videos subscribe to get notified as soon as I upload a video click on the bell icon like share and comment to my videos in this video we shall check the unboxing of the stylus use for mobile LV fine point second-generation the price mention over here is 1569 but I got this from Amazon for $4.99 you can give the link in the description here it's a black color it's available in other colors too let's check inside the box it's a cover in the cover you find the stylus itself and a tiny ball which has an extra nipple for further use [Music] let's check the nib it's kind of stainless steel and it has silicon cover to it so that there won't be any scratches on the mobile this [Music] and the stylus support it's heavy at one end light of the nib site it's simple Matt kind of finish on the top on the top of the stylus is a stay ELB banding going to the bottom it has a cap with a single line [Music] and this is a nib which is the inside the stylus and it's flexible and this extra nib is going to be replaced [Music] so now let's test how is going to work on mobile it's it feels easy to operate on the mobile is also responsive very accurately now we shall check how it is going to do if you are doing some paintings I'm using a sketch up here to check the painting overall experience I feel it's lagging sometimes take one second gap while doing it I think it's not so clear for you guys to view in that angle but shoulding going to upload some painting video soon from the mobile so that you can see it the response time is not so great sometimes it's not responding very nicely we need to repeat it again in the year I would say it's 90% great at overall performance sometime it's lagging that's it for the video guys see in the next period [Applause] [Music]", "gZ0Yc1FxXp8": "I look I'm to get your drawing on with your new tablet or phone I've got a stylus that is very Universal and might just be what you looking for that are kind of looking for a stylus for use with an electronic device whether it's a phone or a tablet doesn't really matter there are a lot of options out there to be honest and there's not one that stands out to be the amazing and all of B all of of styluses now of course if you have an iPad pro the Apple pencil might be the one you're kind of looking for however that Apple pencil is only working with specific devices that are designed to work with Apple pencil so for instance if you have an iPad and an iPhone that pencil will work with your iPad pro but will not work with your iPhone so there are universal stylus is out there and some are different than others some will pair with your phone to try to be as accurate as possible some will just be the old big broad point capacitive stylus nothing fancy about it not very accurate but a little more accurate it can't feel these sometimes than your finger but more than anything else to put it's putting a utensil in your hand so it feels more like drawing on paper stand in this is the Miko high sensitivity stylus which is capacitive but has a very fine tip is battery operated so this actually is a rechargeable battery built-in does not need to connect via bluetooth to the device at all you turn it on by just flicking this and right away now there are ups and downs no matter what style is you're looking at there are ups and downs but this will work with basically any capacitive touchscreen on the market which means essentially all tablets and phones and everything so there are some really good upsides to this downsides specifically I'm going to actually compare it because I have one to the Apple pencil the Apple pencil is more accurate it should be it's also five times the price so this is about 25 bucks this is 120 I think is about the new one actually is right now so pretty I mean stage will price upgrade this wire charge was wirelessly with the iPad this actually has a micro USB port on the top and I am going to bring it in here in a second but just going to go over some differences here this will write on the tablet it is connected to the tablet it doesn't matter if your hands on the tablet or screen or not this will write the new one you can actually change if you're in certain app so you can between drawing and erasing so there are some neat things about the new Apple pencil this is just gonna draw and if you have a lot of stuff on the screen it may not draw and we're gonna show you that as well probably keep this as brief as I can but let's bring in and show you the device then we're going to actually writing and show you what I mean so this is not the box that it actually comes in it does come just kind of then the pen I guess or pencil plus a micro USB cord does not come with the USB adapter but you can plug into any of your USB adapters or your phone or whatever this is the actual style itself as you can see it does have the old kind of like steel mesh I guess soft and that you can just use it as a standard stylus and that one does not need power then you have the nice pointed tip that one will not do anything unless it's actually powered and down here you can see this kind of knurled section and then there's little pinhole and that pinhole actually is the light indicator tie-in status blue light is on no light is off and then when you plug it in for charging it'll actually be red so that's essentially what it is pretty simple and like I said for the charging is right here on the end just micro USB nothing fancy there and obviously you come to the cable so that is the stylus it fits like a normal pen or pencil does so it feels like one it is what do you call it a shock absorber spring-loaded in the tip a little bit so you have a little bit of that you know feels I got like a mechanical pencil almost essentially so yeah let's pull open the app and let's see how she draws all right we're gonna keep this as simple as possible and I'm gonna actually first write with my Apple pencil to kind of show you what I do and I'll just write let's write my name so I can't my hand my hand on here it doesn't really matter Brian there we are nothing fancy it is what it is now if I take the Miko stylus and I'm not going to turn it on first it won't it actually won't do anything without it being on now of course on this side it will as soon as I turn it on blue lights on I can write but if I'm going to rest my hand on the iPad it's the same thing that you would have with any capacitive stylus at all doesn't necessarily mean that'll actually work you see how it kind of goes off and on it all depends but obviously if you used to doing it you know you can still do it but that's the big drawback to this is that but however if you want to if you you know say anything about it and trying to do it as best I can it is specifically better than using the old you know the old soft stylus type thing substantially better actually a good price and it's nice because I don't have to worry about it linking to it and then I just twist it off and it actually works pretty darn good I gotta give it I gotta give you props isn't the Apple pencil no but it is it is it 150 Apple pencil I definitely would say so so that's the Miko high sensitivity stylus things right I see a high sensitivity stylus if it came down to it it's a pretty solid little product it really is for 25 bucks it works with all the phones and tablets it's a one-time tool you know is this something that I would say oh yeah I'm gonna buy this so I can use it all the time not the stylist I would be looking at but if I'm looking for something to give my kids that I'm not too worried about cuz obviously a pencil is expensive you lose that it's not cool this I'm not as worried about and it definitely would teach them good things it works good like I said you have to find kind of that happy medium because if you put too many points of contact on the on the screen you may not get this to actually register because it is a capacitor style that's all it is but it works very well the battery life 180 days I think is what they call standby time but 10 hours of actual use continuously and one hour for charge time so pretty solid for Miko no I would I would say this is a pretty neat product specifically for 25 bucks because there's a lot of other powered stylus is out there that a lot more than this 25 bucks no pairing turn it on go works pretty good I got to get at that so that said March take peak at the top of the description I put a link where you can take a look at this specifically right on Amazon let me know what you think in the comments down below like comment subscribe if you have any questions for me let me know but thank you for stopping by thank you for watching this video thanks for giving it a thumbs up if you have time and we will catch you back here for a future video review we'll see you soon [Music] [Applause]", "9Ed-2ToqZKs": "hello everyone welcome back to my channel I'm here to share the stylus Spain are used for my cartoon as you can see I have this to paint from underneath and they were nice enough to send me the pen and I'll be dropping down a link below for you to get the paint any type you want to get there I had this too which is the other name in e4 which is the smaller version and it works for all devices and it even though it's written for iPhone for new icon and other smart devices it works for any touchscreen which is cutting capacitive touchscreen and the other one which is the pro for stylus this is also great for cutting in your picture so I'll be revealed it to pain and letting you decide which one you would like to walk with so the first one comes in a carton and it as a screw cap I'd be easily plain so it doesn't kind of look new because I've been trying it out to see how effective it is and believe me it has been great and it has been cool so this is the design of the pen as you can see it's very small uncomfortable and really portable you can travel along with it and it has a clip so you could clip any um you can flip it to your clothes to your phones or anywhere sir and for you to work with the painting up to unscrew the cup so this is it once your screw it it reviews this edge to you and it has like it digs and the edge I donated my camera in focus for you to see once you can see it has this edge which enables you to touch your screen to draw properly and I'm going to demonstrate using the the mini stylus first then once I'm done with that I would demonstrate using the pro 4 [Music] [Music] [Music] so after using the mini for stylus at the contrary tell you that this friend is great for you to outline aids the is an alternative compared to the Apple pencil for any of us who can't afford the Apple pencil and it works great and the pros about this vein is that you don't need any special connection to make you work and you don't need to charge any battery just pick it up and start sketching but at the point in time you would need to change the Adickes because sometimes it wears out so you just need to change it once when they dig as one ounce so you can have precise drawing and it works great as you can see these are some of my drawings I've made initially and it's the responses rather smooth it's very very smooth and responsive so this is the mini for stylists I'll drop a link in the description below for you to get the pen and you could get 10% discount if you use my promo code or my discount code all will be in the description below so do try to get one of yourself and talking about the pro for the profile works exactly like the mini for but just that it has a different design and it's it's slimmer and longer in length and I actually prefer this proof for because of the stylish way it comes and how beautiful the pen is as you can see it's in a dark area so I don't know if you can see the beauty of this pin and obviously for the profile you have to also unscrew the cup let me try unscrewing the cup so once you unscrew the cap is going to review the pain to you with the tip and you could also screw the cover below so it doesn't get missing say this is how the pro 4 is and it also works similarly to how the Mini 4 works but I actually prefer the prefer because it seemed more realistic it seemed like a realistic pain to me and it feels like I'm actually drawing with a pencil I'm going to show you a brief example of how the pro 4 catches on adobe draw because we see some in the app I've been used to commonly so I'm going to start a new project and show you guys how this works so at the end of this sketching out the drop down a review and also a link for you to get the pencil be sure to purchase it and see you at the end of the video [Music] [Music] [Music]", "xslVShW0vyc": "hi my name is nutnfancy I'll be reviewing two small pocket lights for amazon.com the first is the stylus Street our Streamlight stylus second one is a stream like stylist pro this top one here first off we'll talk about the stylus the regular one this is a thin led portable flashlight both like both of the lights super high quality made of anodized aluminum the stylus has a glossy anodized finish on it it is a fairly bright LED I think they listed at about 4.5 4.3 lumens that's what it looks like has a momentary push-button switch at the end if you want it to be a constant on you have to actually rotate it stay on position like such not quite as convenient as a push-button switch but fairly functional has a clip on it as well can rotate around the body kind of like some of the pins you've seen in the past also comes with a barrel guard for the tip of the light so you can place this on super sure what the purpose is I guess if you want to focus a light more it's helpful if you do store this light in a fanny pack which is a one of my purposes and uses for it make sure that you unscrew this light this tail switch all the way if you don't you can actually actuate it inside your carry compartment and actually burn the battery out so you should be able to unscrew it to the point where you can't actuate the push-button switch in that way you won't kill your battery when you need it most so you know I'm gonna have to come about halfway out on that switch in order to do that this kind of a disadvantage of this particular design of not having a push-button switch at that point you can see I'm not turning the light on but then I when I got to spend the time to screw that all the way back in which is kind of a hassle not too bad with two hands with one hand it is kind of hassle this is a great little light the advantage of this would be the super small form-factor anywhere a pen can fit the stylus Streamlight can fit as well and that's a big advantage if you're just using a light for electronics inspecting various places you don't need like a super-bright light it's a great choice they do serial number it which doesn't mean a lot it's just basically stream lights way of telling you that they have built a quality product and they're willing to back it up with a serial number next is a Streamlight stylus pro this is an upgrade from the regular stylus you can see it's a little bit thicker a little bit shorter by the way they do use different batteries this is a quadruple a battery in the regular stylus you have a triple a battery and the stylus Pro that's an advantage actually to have that bigger battery that means you're you got got more energy to power the LEDs and theoretically a longer runtime the runtime for the regular stylus I believe is listed at 60 hours and this one is run actually 7.5 hours now that kind of goes against what I was just saying but they've chosen to put a higher they call it a high flux led in the Streamlight stylist Pro so it's a brighter light more useful and perhaps more situations so the downside is maybe a little bit less runtime but actually 7.5 hours if you indeed you get that I really haven't tested the duration yet but if you get that that's pretty darn good for a tiny little pin light especially having that output stream whitelists output on the top on the stylus pro at 24 lumens for seventy seven point five hours that's pretty darn good it's a point five or half a watt LED Lux ian is a brand leds coming out and like I've said in my write-up there's a LED quality has really improved in the last few years and it may continue to do so as of the taping of this video may tooth to date these are pretty darn good lights both of them are stylish Pro probably representing more of the cutting edge of the smallest most compact light you can get in this type of brightness level and more specifics on the stylist Pro is a unlike the rater stylist it has a push-button switch so it's a simple matter of just pushing on pushing off I think everyone's familiar with that also the stylist Pro has an advantage in that it's an electronically controlled light output if you remember your old Mini Maglite that everyone has and we all use four years with the double-a power sources the problem with that is it would the output would become inconsistent now you have to use to bang that thing on something that get it to come on again that's because output was not electronically controlled as the battery output diminished the light would diminish and you have all kinds of inconsistencies in the beam well supposedly the electronics in the stylist Pro I don't know if I don't think the regular stylist has it but Stylus Pro has that electronically controlled output which will prevent such things also you can see the clip on this one is a little more serious it's a thicker it's you know the fashionable taps go black if that's important to you and it's fast and it won't rotate and slide up and down the barrel kind of like the regular stylus so that would make it a little more secure for belt use cut you know pocket you want to clip it to the corner of your pocket like you would a knife or something it's pretty good it's also made out of anodized aluminum with supposedly a mil to an anodized I'm not really sure what that means but it sounds pretty special I will say it's pretty durable I have several these lights I've used them fairly hard I'm a pilot in the US military and I've used him in that capacity and I've been very pleased with this light I will say this is one of my heroines so it doesn't really show the wear and tear just so it looks fairly good for the video between the two I think each one has its own purpose here's a little light comparison first off that's the output of the stylist Pro here's a regular stylist still pretty good output both the batteries in these are fairly fresh didn't use very little but both these out lights are excellent quality they're backed up by a very good company with lifetime warranties if you have any problem Streamlight I've never really had a problem but I have friends that have and that they'll just replace it it's like kind of a no-questions-asked type deal for the money you're gonna pay for either the lights it's a it's a no-brainer if I had to choose between the two if I had the room if depending on the application probably the stylist Pro I like that look sorry I like that push-button switch a lot and it's pretty handy I do however you use a stylus as well because it's so thin like I said in the fanny pack maybe in your flight suit pocket if it's just perfectly and honestly I haven't found the brightness of the stylist the regular one this one to be lacking however the extra output of the South Pro is pretty cool especially in those situations where he may be looking for a beam effectiveness beyond 6 feet or so it can reach out there if you use these lights within their design limitations ie these are not lights that you would go searching for your dog for in the deep dark woods you know long distances maybe 50 yards they're going to be great but anything I've found within you know probably 25 feet that might be pushing a little bit but within the limitations of their beam you're going to be very happy with them that's it nothing fancy out on the stylist Pro and the regular stylist flashlights hope you enjoyed it I'll do more videos later", "9qzCQuGOFaI": "[Music] hi this is justice with tablet pro i'm doing a walk through here and best buy there's a number of different computers here that are brand new and for sale and i have not been able to find pen tests on any of them so i just went through and did all of them all of them that i could find i skipped some of the lenovo ones because uh they were very difficult to test and they're using a wacom tech and so it was quite frustrating actually trying to use the lenovos now i use the raphael r520 stylus you can see the link for this stylus in the description we're having a sale on it for uh black friday and uh for the rest of the month so feel free to stop by i was actually surprised at how much difference there was in between all of the hp computers so some of these ones like the envy x360 were terrible was really bad and then the hp pavilions was my surprising top choice here but you can see here this envy x360 is so bad now most of these are actually using the new intel tiger like chipsets which i like a lot greatly improved for medium gaming or aaa gaming on low settings and very nice processors in most of these the surface go 2 was broken at best buy so i wanted to include it as well just so you guys can see where it's at same stylus here and gives you an idea if you're new to this channel you should subscribe if you use a stylus or you want to use a stylus and you use windows 10. so there's a couple things that we do we have a shortcut panel which is keyboard hotkeys it's great for note takers great for artists great for designers and all of these will switch with you when you do it so you don't have to do any special work in order to have all the hotkeys that you use ready and available for you so you can put your favorite hotkeys over here on the side the ones that use the most and do all these things that i need to do color pick and resize the brush switch to erasers all this stuff that i use a thousand times i can do it really quickly from the side of the tablet and i love that that's great and we also have the pen tool which allows you to customize what the pen does if you're using a windows ink compatible pen like the surface pen or the r520 then this is a great tool for you you're going to want to pick that up it's in the microsoft store and i'll put links to these things in the description of this video we're doing a one-day sale i've never done this before but what i'm going to do is i'm going to put the stylus which is normally 39.99 and the pen tool which comes free 4.99 and the full artist pad tablet pro package which is normally 26. and we'll do all of that for 49.99 just today so if you're watching this video check that out immediately and grab that because it's something you're going to want if you use a windows 10 tablet and a stylus all right let's go ahead and jump back into the video now the one that i was looking at testing the most was the xps 13 two and one with the 11th gen tiger-like processor i was not able to get my hands on it however there is the dell xps not xps the um inspiron here this is the one that i thought was probably the top in the group um the ins inspiron yeah i think that's right uh the 73 10 yeah you can see here this is actually very nice this machine by the way a great price really nice clean lines it's a little on the thick heavy side and i believe this is an i5 processor um but pretty solid like uh pretty impressed with this yeah the 7300 by dell the inspiron someone correct my pronunciation if you would in the comment section uh was not good but the uh next one here nope not this one yeah a number of these did not support tilt and i've gotta wonder how much of this you can see the phantom touches on the screen how much of this is driver issues and is fixable and you know these are possibly broken because their store floor models i'm not sure but but worth noting but a lot of them do not seem to support tilt uh all of these i tested in one note uh yes i no onenote is a vector drawing program that uses stabilization built in i don't have any issue with that because and here i'm using the dell stylus yeah i believe it's actually the dell active stylus on the hp spectra spectre and it was cleaner than the r520 but did not have tilt so all these i'm testing and onenoke is pre-installed and the pencils will show you tilt it'll show you uh pressure variants and um and you can see the difference between a computer that has poor stabilization or not stabilization that has poor line quality and one that does not here surface laptop go does not support the pen but the laptop three does this is dell inspiron inspiron and these might perform better with a different stylus the stylus i'm using is microsoft pen protocol so it's um pretty standard but uh they vary you might find some that work better or a lot better all right this one i like this one i was actually looking at uh the reason i would not pick this one up as opposed to the dell xps is that the xps has a brighter screen 500 plus knit brightness and this one is a um 300 nit screen it does have a spot in the keyboard for you to store the pen and it'll charge the pen i was not able to get my hands on the actual um pen there but the 7306 and the 7506 of the dell inspiron series both were standouts nice and they are using the new intel 11th gen processors as well and again the pavilion performs well so the difference in some of these is the um chip it might be an i5 or an i3 and sometimes it makes a big difference it might be a 15.6 inch screen 14 inch or 13.3 inch screen depending on the laptop and again here back to yoga i'm using the wacom pen so no if you guys are are looking at the r520 stylus that it does not work with lenovo um two and ones that that i tested today i'm probably not i'm not sure if there are any lenovos that do use the same microsoft pen protocol or n-trig this one was so bad again these could be driver issues it could be individual computer issues but it was really encouraging to see how many of these of the computers at best buys just supported pen i know it was not like that three or four years ago so i am not a fan of the hp envy line um not a single one of them tested well every single one was pretty bad for gaming was just fine this is the um wacom the bamboo inc plus i believe or might just be the second gen of the bamboo ink but it was not good and again if you guys have a lenovo yoga and it's great and works really well um please share that with us so that we have something to offset this somewhat well actually very bad uh impression that's being left uh in the lenovo yoga line yeah just bad and it could be that that specific stylus as well could be the problem surface line performed very well which is no surprise um my primary machine is the surface pro 7 i7 and and i think it's great wish that it had a little bit cleaner lower jitter lines but but overall it's i don't complain too much about it all of these i would definitely check to see which ones allow you to attach the pen magnetically um service pro x was possibly the cleanest um next to the hp pavilion line pavilion i think was a little bit cleaner well surface pro 7 is actually quite good maybe the best all right if i had to say i'd say surface pro 7 hp pavilion then the surface pro x um surface book 3 was up there right around the same as the pavilion but with a heavier tilt all right that's it you guys if you want more like this please subscribe and stay creative", "BHIoLO58cTM": "hey geeks this is Tony with accessorygeeks.com today we are going to review the high sensitive stylus pen spend really cool cuz it's very sleek you know could fit into one of their shirt pockets no problem could always carry it around the reason why I like this product is because most of you I phone users know that you know you get your screen so dirty kind of like mine right now get your screen so dirty because you just play around with your fingertips and stuff like that and you know it might even scratch it off for ladies who have nails so to prevent that we had the stylus pen let me show you how it works it's a very nice rubbery feeling at the end so you know everything works perfect well like that touch sensitive so you know that we can clicks on no problem and you know some people might say you know you look really geeky just playing around with your phone just crunching numbers using two fingers but yeah so in order for you to counteract that there is a

right here we are greeted with a gold rose gold pen right here as well as a black pen right here you can also see that there are 1 2 disks plus another one and two discs as well as 1/2 fiber tips so let's go ahead and remove the rose gold and let's go ahead see what the build quality is actually like on the digi root rose gold stylus pen so you can see right here it does have the digi root branding right here with a texture right here that is not very grippy but it is actually good for when you want to not get a callus on your finger so basically you can see that this is actually removable you can go ahead and remove the tip to your personal preference so let's go ahead keep that in here and then let's take a look around the pen in more detail so you can see there is a twist option right here to remove this part of the pen so when you open that up you actually are getting a disk right here for the tip of the pen so it actually tells you do not remove that part of the pen because that will actually detach the pen so basically let's see if this is actually working and that's actually pretty cool so you can actually screw on the back part of the pen to the front to the back when you're not using it so you won't lose it or anything like that which is actually pretty cool and then when you're ready to use it again you can actually put it right back over the disc so let's go ahead and take a look at the black version of this and I think it's actually pretty cool you can choose how many pens you want and actually chose to I think you can actually get from one to two and I think they even let you up add additional options so you can see the black did you pinch with the grip as well and the same deal you are getting a tip right here as well as if you unscrew this part another disc on this side so definitely like in the bill quality let's go ahead and test out the digi root pen on the 8.4 inch device okay so let's go ahead and unlock our device so let me just go ahead and put my password in so I'll just take one second right here and now I'm back in so let me just go to the main screen of the device so let's go ahead and put the stylus of this pen just let go let's go ahead and put the stylus to the screen and that's actually very responsive right now so the stylus is actually very responsive and it actually does work on this green so you can see right here it is actually very accurate as well and I'm able to actually scroll through my screen with this stylus so I definitely think this is gonna be pretty cool for just navigating maybe even doing some graphic arts on this device so also the pen can be used on a number of different cell phones as well so it's actually compatible with a whole list of options for cell phones that you could basically use this pen if you're an artist or anything like that so if you're into like drawing just like me or just like having the option of a really nice high-end pen that you can use for a very affordable price I would definitely recommend this and you can actually see right here that you can toggle through Facebook and it is accurate I'm sometimes here I'm actually choosing a picture when I don't want to but I'll learn how it actually works with the device so let's just go over to Instagram really quickly and let's just take a look at Instagram for a second and [Music] so here we are over on Instagram you can see the pen is actually working very nicely so you can see right here you're just getting a really nice experience with the pen so I definitely think this is gonna be pretty cool definitely would recommend it so far but I'm gonna have to do a follow up video with the digi route pen so make sure you stay locked in and if you found this video helpful definitely hit the like button your voice Toronto make sure you stay tuned for more videos just like this if you haven't already subscribed definitely do so right now but in the meantime have a great morning afternoon evening depending where you are have a great night [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "p8gy-WvhhNs": "what's up guys I'm Korn back at you with another review today we got something that I believe can replace the Apple pencil if you're not willing to spend $100 on a stylus so if you're like me and you don't see yourself if you're not really an artist and you don't see yourself using the Apple pencil to do really good drawings and things like that you just want an active stylus for maybe taking notes here and there and things like that the black web the black web rechargeable active stylus might be for you let's take a look at the pencil it's housing aluminum you got well the one thing I don't like is the metal tip it's got a metal tip on it and I mean tapping that around on your screen just doesn't feel right feels like you're gonna scratch it up on the top doubles as a as a soft-touch stylus type thing really smooth really nice it's better than like a a rubbery one cuz everyone grips to the screen it's just it's nasty so that's a really nice touch to the pencil that the Apple pencil just doesn't give you on the top sets of magnetic stays on there really nice it's not gonna knock off then that reveals your micro USB charging cable their charging port I'm sorry I like that better than the Apple pencil because it you plug it into the pencil as opposed to plugging the pencil into something so this goes in the Apple pencils lightning cable actually comes out so then you can sit in there with a plug into your iPad like that I know that's kind of goofy but there's your power button right there you don't got to connect via bluetooth or anything and just push that you got your blue oval and then now you can use it and let's jump into the mid-south so I'm not an artist but I'm going to select black fine tip marker and as you can see I mean there's a couple spaces when I went to draw my D hand down over my initials something do it again okay well that was better but there's still a space there's a space there's a bunch of spaces in us maybe I mean I haven't charged this unit it doesn't give you you know it doesn't tell you how much batteries in it I haven't charged it but maybe that's the reason that that's happening but I just feel like when you're drawing you want to take notes you don't want gaps in your lines so that's something to keep in mind by the way this is right around $20 I think it was actually right at $20 actually so much better than 100 so that was good then we got a Deanna Nell they both look good they both look fine if you don't wanna spend $100 on an Apple pencil this would definitely be the way to go I would recommend this item it's definitely for somebody that just kind of wants to use it here and there to take notes and maybe draw a picture and just use a regular stylist [Music]", "GvNppsGHu1w": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "ZUzN1iEjoCg": "Paul's iOS device is a proud supporter of the national campaign against drunk driving hello ladies and gentlemen Paul here with Paul's iOS device and I have another great unboxing for you today this is the Lago stylus slim obviously from melago and I want to go ahead and thank the folks over at lago for cinema this review product to show you unbox and review for you so without further ado let's take a look at the packaging in the upper left hand corner you've got the name of the product and in the upper right hand corner and even on the slim itself is the olavo branding so far in the front you've got a really nice presentation of the ELA go slim now nothing at the bottom nothing on the right side or left side and on the back you've got the colors of all of the Slim's and they come in black chocolate jean indigo red pink gold and the one I have here is the silver one so a logo does a really good job at giving you some variety with this so let's go ahead and pop this case open I really needed to use a sharp object to get underneath these tabs here just pry that out these are pretty difficult to to remove but once those are done let's put the knife away from here just pop the top off you've got to kind of shake this out of the packaging okay now that we've got it out of the plastic sleeve let's turn it around and let's take a look at this stylus slim feeling this packaging it the slim is suppressed in this foam like material let's pull the slim out and this slim has some decent heft to it you've got the allow go branding at the top turning it around you've got a logo design in California and you got the slim branding also at the top it's very minimal they try to make it as minimal as possible it's very very sleek design it is made out of solid aluminum let's put that off to the side and what this stylus does to stand apart from all the others is that it includes an extra tip so not only are you getting a very quality stylus for a cheap price around $13 you're also getting an extra tip so you are pretty much getting to styluses for the price of one so taking the original tip off you can see that all it is is thread it on so in case it does go bad in the future you can easily unscrew it and screw the extra tip right on now you've got your second stylus so the size of this thing is a little bit more than half the size of an ordinary pencil so now let's go ahead and put this stylus to the test I've got a few applications here that I want to use this stylus on first one is called pen ultimate by Evernote this is a pretty nice notetaking application so let's open that up and by the looks of it it is very easy to write with you do have to put some pressure with it so I'm just lightly pressing on the screen and you can see I'm not getting any kind of feedback but you have to press down quite a bit to get some feedback from the application this is where the extra tip would really come into play is that I think this tip sticks out of the aluminum stylus a little bit too much to where the rubber tip bends as you can see here it may may bend a little bit too much so the rubber tip may wear out and if that's the case go ahead and put that extra tip on the end so that is just my thought it that may not be the case but that's just what I've observed let's go ahead and head into the notes application and let's peck away at a keyboard with the stylus and let's go ahead and type something in here what should we type well let's uh don't forget to subscribe to Paul's iOS device so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button above that way you see new videos like this in your subscription box but back to the review I really I do like this stylus a lot it does this job but I think the main attraction to the stylus is the extra tip and also the design factor it really goes well with your Apple products it is very sleek and very slim as you can tell by the name and this application called digits is just a calculator so if you peck away at this this calculator it's pretty much the same as pecking away at the keyboard so if you're in the market for a stylus that is sleek slim and very minimalistic take a look at the slim stylus it comes with an extra tip you cannot beat that and another thing that you can't beat is the pricing at around $13 on Amazon or at allow go design.com this stylus comes with the extra tip so you're pretty much getting to stylus for the price of one so head over to Ill I'll go design.com I'll have the link to that in the description below I hope you enjoyed this review if so pound that like button down below and slammed esops but above that way you see new videos like this in your subscription box thanks for watching this is paul god bless", "iN7s0SOg7fY": "hello everyone this is teal in today's video I'm going to review this digital stylus called and donut not last that's made for selected iPad models the iPads that are supported are 2018 or newer models and those would be the iPad third generation eleven and twelve point nine inch iPad air the gen iPad six and seven and iPad Mini five this towers doesn't work on tablets meant by other manufacturers now many months ago adani released style is called don\u00edt note this is the dahle note plus the main differences between the not class and the not appears well both support palm rejection but the new stylus has pressure sensitivity as well as killed sensitivity in addition to palm rejection and this support slightly over 2,000 levels of pressure sensitivity I'm going to give you the bottom line up front the doughnut note plus it's an excellence dollars for taking notes it has no misalignment so it's really accurate at capturing handwriting now when it comes to drawing it doesn't perform as well as I expected even though it has pressure sensitivity so if you are looking for stallers to take notes with this is something that I can recommend very easily but for drawing purposes I still recommend the Apple pencil even though it's more expensive by the way I have a tax review to go alongside with this video the link to that hex review will be in a video description below do check that out in case I have any updates to you my video review alright let's take a closer look at the stylus there are two side buttons here and this button doubles up as a power button as well just press once and this will light up to tell you that it's powered on battery life is rated to be around 10 hours and takes one hour to fully charge it to power off you just have to press this button and hold for five seconds or it will power off automatically after 20 minutes of inactivity now to charge this dollars you can charge it on the back with the USBC cable that's provided the documentation says you can still use the stylus while it's charging include a charging cable it's a bit too short you may be able to program this to physical shortcut buttons to your specific shortcuts but whether or not you can do so really depends on the app that you use this met service tip provides a bit of friction on glass service if you're using this on a Mac screen protector it's going to give you a very nice tactile feeling now this is replaceable but you have to buy the replacement tips yourself not included in the box the stylus has this nice matte texture throughout and it's really nice to hold this whole thing is made of plastic you quality seems to be quite solid and the weight is just nice not too heavy and not too light palm rejection works on almost all the apps but pressure sensitivity to sensitivity and we don't know you can customize the shortcut buttons here really depends on the apps that you use so this are the apps that support the stylus you can find this list on a donuts website I'll put a link to this page in the video description below so for example here with this app called concepts it supports palm rejection tilt pressure and ability to customize the shortcuts but for me being paint pro it doesn't support your sensitivity and to access the full features of this dollars you have to pair it with each app you use so if you use for drawing apps you have to pair it four times pairing and the use of this dollars requires bluetooth now you just have to pair it once and you can close the app open it again and it will recognize and remember the stylus at the time of this review there is no support for this dollars on procreate yet but on the product page it says progress support will be coming very soon all right let me show you how to pair the stylus I'm going to use MIDI Bank paint you can still use the stylus even if you do not pair it but there won't be any pressure sensitivity and palm rejection so to pair this tallest with MIDI Bank paint you just have to click pen pressure settings it's easier in this section to parodist all's you have to turn on the power and press with the stylus tip now even though the power is already on use do you need to press the button again and press the tip against this section here so now it's paired now that this stylus is paired with mini bank pain pro with this particular app you can customize their to shortcut buttons you can choose from the list of shortcuts that are available and notice here there's this a palm rejection option some of the app will have this option if you turn this on the app will only recognize pen input so with palm rejection turned on in the settings for this software you won't even be able to use finger gestures so I need to turn that off now the palm rejection from the pen it's already pretty good so you don't have to turn that on so now you have access to all the finger gestures and now you should have pressure yep it does have pressure you may notice the animation it's a bit choppy so I'm not sure if that's an issue with app or with the stylus but I've tried this dollars with other drawing apps and those were pretty smooth so I think it could be an issue with mini Bank pain Pro so maybe they need to update the app to support the stylus better and as you can see there are various pressure so the drawing experience it's not that nice with the choppy animation it's still usable but if the lines they were smooth I mean the animation if it was smoother it would be a more satisfactory experience alright let me switch to another app this app I'm using now it's called concepts and you also supposed a stylus so what I want to show you here is how the line transitions from thin to thick the line transition here for this dollars is not as smooth compared to Apple pencil so here you can see thin as suddenly becomes very thick and here it's thick suddenly becomes very thin so the transition is not as smooth and here when I taper the line off it should taper to a shot point but here tapers to a thick and we don't know the lines taper to a shot point or something like this sometimes depends on their happen you use as well I'm happy to say that performance we have concepts it's way smoother compared to me being painted Pro and tilt works as well this dollars by the way is very accurate the line is always directly beneath the pen tip so there is no misalignment at all regardless of how you hold a pen this is Zen brush - this app supports pressure and tooth sensitivity so now we have the thin lines the thick lines this app we also show you the angle of the pen pay attention to the cursor that appears as I touch the screen so notice the cursor see how it follows the direction of the stylus so we've Zen brush - you can draw with the pen at an angle to get the broad strokes and drove the pan vertically to get in strokes this is art studio Pro so before I can have projects as activity with this app I need to pair this again press the power button and click and it's connected now with this particular hair there doesn't seem to be any way for me to customize the shortcut buttons so pressure sensitivity you books here no issues of all the note-taking apps that I have here only zoom notes supports the stylus have already passed this dollars we've zoom nuts so let's see what features we have access to so here is a is connected donut not plus it even tells you the battery life and here we can customize the - shocker buttons so these are Shaka's you can choose from this app doesn't support the stylus so there is no pressure and tooth sensitivity but there's the palm rejection and palm rejection works really well so I'm writing all this with my palm on the screen so even though this app doesn't support the donut note class you can still use the stylus it's just that you won't be able to have pressure and tooth sensitivity and this applies to all the other apps that do not support this dollars you will still have palm rejection but you won't have pressure and cure sensitivity and you won't be able to customize the to sight patterns the overall writing and drawing experience really depends on the apps you use so some apps will be smoother some apps will be a bit choppy for example in this case with MIDI Bank paint Pro it's a bit choppy but overall with most of the apps that I've used it's on the smooth side and I've discovered one issue as well earlier on in the video I mentioned you can close the app and open it again and it should be able to remember to tell us sometimes there is a slight delay with the app remembering the stylus so you have to wait for a split second or two before you can draw with pressure sensitivity alright to conclude if you write a lot and you are looking for a stylus for taking notes this is one I can recommend very easily because it's excellent and capturing handwriting now if you want to save some money you can actually go with the previous model the add-on it not the one with that pressure sensitivity that's cheaper but it's also as good when it comes to taking notes for drawing purposes I still recommend the Apple pencil because that's just better but the Apple pencil is more expensive compared to donut not class and donut note anyway if you are interested to get this dollars to consider getting it through the Amazon of flailings in the video description below that helps the channel alright thanks for watching I hope this video is helpful see you in the next one bye", "t-gWqzVwuWE": "hi this is cure for apocalypse calm today I'm going to review this new stylist called the donut pixel this is a Bluetooth stylus that is made for iOS devices such as the iPad iPhone now this dollars has precious sensitivity so today I'm going to review these dollars from the perspective of someone who uses these to draw a doughnut is the name of the company they make a lot of digital statuses and a doughnut pixel this particular stylus is the latest one from them that features pressure sensitivity now the earlier model for this is actually the doughnut jot touch with pixelpoint and earlier model for pixel point is actually just called jot touch so let's take a look at some of the differences between the current model and the previous model now the previous model is a bit shorter and if you look at the diameter is a bit wider the tip is also a bit bigger the previous model uses a 3.1 mm tip versus the new one which is 1.9 mm so the new design is more streamlined now in terms of the comfort when iam when I'm using it for drawing I think it's slightly more comfortable because this design is closer to normal pens like ballpoint pens or fountain pens now this older model is slightly wider but still rather comfortable to use and because they are still selling the older model and with the new model out sometimes you can get good discounts on the older model if you don't mind physical differences built quality for the stylus is quite good in fact I think this is quite excellent it's very hot very tough and I'm very sure that it is very durable now you can get the dollars in two different colours one is black and one is this gold like brownish color I think this one looks quite nice one thing I do not like about the design is there two buttons here they are flush I think close to the side of the body so it's a bit difficult to detect the buttons as I move around them perhaps it might be have been better if they were to protrude the buttons out a bit like those Wacom styluses now just below the two buttons as this little slip here this is the battery light indicator if it shows you a red light means that it's time to charge the stylus battery life or this dollars is actually quite good I've only charged tape ones and I've used it for maybe a week or so and I haven't seen the need to charge it so battery life is quite good but this is a new stylus so the battery is going to deteriorate as you use it as we charge more often that is the same for all stylus by the way and to charge these dollars a donut has provided a USB charger so you need to plug this USB charger into your USB port and then put your stylus like this so if your laptop has our horizontal USB port is going to look something like this one is charging if your USB port is vertical then it's going to look something like this when you're charging be careful not to lose this charger because this is very small I have lost this once before for an a different model and it was actually hidden in some corner of my back and I wasn't able to find it and I bought a replacement charger for I cannot remember how much and then a few days later I found a charger in my back so be careful do not lose this charger this is the 1.9 mm tip of a doughnut pixel by the way the company also makes other styluses with very small tips as well for example this is the Adonit jot - you can see that the tip sizes they are quite similar and there is another style is called the Adonit jot script - it's also quite similar in size and let me show you the Apple pencil just for comparison now the tip of the Apple pencil and the tip of a doughnut pixel I will see they are quite similar the main difference probably would be the taper of the Apple pencil which is more gradual and this is a bit of this deeper and this is the earlier model the pixel point you can see the difference is actually not too significant 3.1 and MT vs. 1 point 9 mm T now I want to point out the wobbling effect here is still there so with the earlier model only the tip wobbles now with the new model you can see that this whole front part is wobbling now you can actually detach this front part let me do that to show you so this is actually our much bigger tip with our smaller tip at the top let me just put it back there's no mention of replacement tip from a doughnut yet but if you do wear of the tip I'm pretty sure you can contact them for replacement tip to buy them so even though both the tip still wobble it's really not too different from ballpoint pens where some of the ballpoint pens their tips wobble as well so the feeling of drawing with the new stylus compared to ballpoint pens where there are tip wobbles is actually very similar so I would say that there's not much difference it's not really a downside to the wobbling tip the other thing I want to talk about is the texture of the tip the new stylus has a texture tip you can see the matte surface now compared to the older tip this is a glossy surface both of these tips they are hot tips however with the textured surface when you're drawing on glass there's more friction so there's more control and this is a very nice feature I'm using the iPad pro today for this demonstration by the way the doughnut pixel is for people who are not using the iPad pro while using earlier iPads iPad minis and if because if you have the iPad pro you should just go get the Apple pencil but if you're not using the iPad pro then the Donna pixel is the next best option now Apple pencil costs us $100 at retail this cost us $80 at retail and both dollars are quite expensive so let's see how well it actually performs now at the time of this review it only supports several apps so right now it does is the procreate but the company says that they are going to support procreate they are going to support Oh Toby drone program in the future but not right now so some of the apps are not going to support a donut for example the Wacom Bamboo paper app that is made by welcome is definitely not going to support a donut stylus because they have them install this yourself and this app here paper is made by this company called 53 they are also not going to support our donut because they have their own stylist for today's demonstration I'm going to be using this Epcot Medibank paint because this app supports dis dollars alright this is the precious settings for MIDI Bank paint now you can turn on or off the pressure of course and I want to turn it on I also want to turn on the palm rejection so here you can see some of the settings that you can change now before you use the stylus you have to power it on you just have to press this button here this lower button and there should be a green light that flashes I'm not sure why there is no green light here perhaps perhaps I already turn it on okay so you can see the green light now it sings with the app and now it shows here the name here is a donut pixel you can choose the writing style this is basically your hand position so just choose one that fits your hand posture you can also set the different buttons under solace two different functions of the software I'm just going to leave it at default I'm going to turn on power injection so I'm just going to pick a brush first just pick a simple brush to show you how well pressure sensitivity works let me start by drawing some very thin lines where I use the least amount of pressure this stylus is very sensitive I just applies the least amount of pressure that I can and I am able to get this thin lines so if you apply more pressure than you can get thicker lines like this notice that there is some black but usually when I'm drawing things the leg doesn't affect me seriously because there is lack but is not the irritating type of black I hope you know what I mean let me clear this space and show you the transition between thin and thick so the transition between thin and thick is very smooth as well by the way there is no way to adjust a pressure curve so you just have to make do with watch you have but by default the pressure curve is quite good it's quite how should I say it's quite predictive as in the sense that the lines come out the way I want them to be so that is a good thing accuracy for this stylus is quite good however it really depends on the hand posture that you choose many drawing software allows you to choose hand posture now when you choose that the cursor will align itself to the point to make some adjustments so that you can draw accurately so a person who is left-handed versus a person who is right-hander the cursor placement is going to be different of course but generally speaking the accuracy is quite good the cursor is almost always very close to the pen tip now I want to talk about palm rejection unfortunately the implementation for palm rejection is not very good and this is a problem that has affected earlier models of a donut touch as well so this is not too surprising but it is a shame that they do not improve on the palm rejection another thing to note is palm rejection also depends on the software implementation so if the software can handle palm rejection well then you get very good palm rejection for example with media Bank pain Pro you can actually turn on streaked palm rejection let me see here so here there is setting for you to switch on palm rejection and now I can actually just draw draw here and there is no there's no straight marks that's caused by my palm however if I actually turn palm rejection off draw sometimes the screen may actually move because now it detects my pen stylus and also my palm I'm not sure if it's going to happen and it should also did you see that little jerk there that's what's going to happen and sometimes in the screaming wolf the canvas may move or sometimes it may just create stray marks so palm rejection is a bit beefy at times so you can see here even though I'm pressing down hard I wasn't able to get any strokes because the screen is detecting my palm and not the stylus all right so to get flawless palm rejection for this particular software I have to switch on palm rejection but this stops me from zooming in so now I have to press this little hand icon here too that allows me to zoom and press the hand icon again to go back to punch action mode some of you might be wondering whether or not this stylus is good for taking notes I'm actually not too sure because I don't think notes often now this software as you can see just now was writing that I was almost no lag so whether or not there's going to be that really depends on the software implementation as well so for this case here the lines come out almost instantaneously and also there was some straight dots while I was writing earlier on see just little straight out here because this app doesn't have pan rejection this and by the way is welcome bamboo paper so if I do take notes this is the app that I like to use because well first of all there is no lag when it comes to taking notes the lines come out almost instantly I'm not going to demonstrate note-taking with other applications because I really do not take a lot of notes and also how well the stylists work with note-taking apps really depends on the software implementation so it's not possible for me to test out every one of those apps for note-taking seriously there's no need to get a donut pixel because the highlight of this stylus is the pressure sensitivity feature you probably do not need pressure sensitivity to take notes so if you buy stylus without that feature is going to be cheaper as well so is the new a donut pixel an improvement over the older a donut jot touch with pixelpoint I would say yes in some areas especially their texture tip which is really very nice gives you the extra friction with which provides extra control when you're drawing on glass surfaces I also like the streamline body very nice too but in terms of drawing functionality these two styles they are actually quite similar the main difference for me will be the texture tip so if you want to save some money perhaps you can get the older pixelpoint if you want the new stuff then a donor pixel I think that's all for my review today if you have any questions feel free to post them in the comment section below I also post a link to my text review in case there are any updates then I can update the text

x360 13 with an amd processor can this be my budget windows art machine of my dreams let's find out hello my name is brad i review tech for creative professionals and as you all know when it comes to drawing tech things can get pretty pricey when a budget alternative pops up there always seems to be a catch the surface go looks really cool but it's underpowered there's some super cheap 200 android tablets out there but eh they're kind of janky and i've been looking for that sweet spot the place where good price meets a good drawing experience and today that search brings me here the hp envy x360 this is an all-in-one windows convertible laptop the screen flips up all the way around so you can set it up and draw on it using the included pen unfortunately and we're just gonna get the bad news out of the way here at the beginning the pen isn't as good as i was hoping it would be but when you factor in the price it might be a trade-off that you're willing to make to have a small portable nice little windows laptop let's take a look at what we've got in the box we've got our power brick and also the extension cable that plugs into it also we have the pen included also that comes with the battery right here in the box you can upgrade it and get a rechargeable version of this pen for 30 dollars more that pen will charge via usb then we have the laptop itself it looks pretty nice it's got this nice brushed metal look it's a it's a darker color it's not ultra light in fact it weighs a good amount but it's solid it feels premium hp has made laptops like this before but what makes this particular one special is it's the amd version the product i am checking out here is the entry level configuration that starts out at 650 dollars it's got a 13.3 full hd that's 1920 by 1080 screen you could jump up to a 15 inch model which has the same resolution but a couple more ports in it on these smaller screens especially a 13 inch screen not having that higher resolution doesn't really bother me much it looks pretty good and it gets plenty bright at 300 nits the viewing angles of the screen are just okay for every position i was in for drawing or using a laptop it was just fine but when i got to filming it i could really see that when you get off to the side or move it around it gets kind of dark this is also a touch enabled screen it's great for pinching and zooming but also the occasional accidental palm mark more on that in a minute also worth pointing out is this screen is a 16 by nine aspect ratio inside we have 256 gigabyte ssd which is more than i expected at this price point like i mentioned before this one is rocking an amd ryzen 3 4 300 u processor if you wanted to spec this out with a better ryzen processor like the 5 or the 7 you can do that too i'm not a benchmark kind of guy but what i wanted to see with this amd ryzen processor was is it too slow for drawing an illustration task does it stack up that way against intel and i'm happy to report it ran adobe photoshop and the creative suite just fine probably not something i'd want to do video editing on but for illustration it was great this model also comes with eight gigabytes of memory built in or if you're an artist or illustrator that's usually the base point i tell most people to shoot for when you're looking at a laptop is you wanna go eight gigabytes or higher you probably don't wanna go under that and there's some more good news here if you got a phillips head screwdriver you could open up the back pretty easily and install more ram down the road if you need to on the left side we have a headphone jack a usb a port and a usb c port that is not thunderbolt 3. in this case that's because we're rocking some amd internals not intel on the right side we have a power port another usb a port and also a micro sd card slot i've seen photos of these before but the usb a ports are the kind that kind of flap open to make the laptop center i thought that was kind of cool and you can make it talk hi i should also point out if you upgrade to that 15-inch version of this laptop there's more ports for example it adds an hdmi port along the side as well there aren't a lot of bells and whistles to this budget-friendly laptop so things like the camera it's only a 720p camera it's only okay but they did manage to fit in a kill switch for that camera and also a fingerprint reader on the keyboard the battery on this thing was pretty good hp rates it about 12 hours of battery life i would say drawing in photoshop i was getting closer to around six hours which is decent windows laptops have come a long way in recent years the low end laptops feel a lot more premium now than they used to this keyboard feels pretty good to type on the all aluminum body gives it a more premium feel in general and even the speakers sound good the speaker grilles are along the bottom of the laptop so it's a bit muffled in laptop mode because of that but it sounds really good when you prop it up for drawing because the speakers are now facing you speaking of drawing the angles on this are pretty good when you flip it around you're probably going to want to hold it with one hand since it is a laptop putty the pull pressure of your palm is gonna close the thing but i found it was pretty comfortable to rest my hand along the side while drawing on it and propping it at the angle i wanted to use it at and that 360 degree hinge holds up pretty well that's something that i worry about the most on these laptops is i have no idea what that hinge is going to be like two years from now one thing i did miss is there's no real place to put the pen there's nowhere to store it on the inside there's no magnets in the pen or along the side of the screen so you could stick the pen to it the pen just kind of is there another thing to be aware of is the fan tended to be on when i was drawing on this thing and the fan points like right it's at the bottom so it points right at your wrist while you're drawing on there so if you don't like hot air blowing on you while you're drawing it does that on to the drawing experience so this is the pen that comes with the hp envy x360 and the main thing to know about this pen is in the back of it there is a battery and what you find in many battery powered pens is that you get some wave and jitter to your lines and this pen is no different so i'm starting this process this little demo here that i'm about to do in autodesk sketchbook and and the reason why is because sketchbook sentence to have wigglier lines wigglier i'm trying having a hard time getting that word out than many other applications and that's totally what i'm seeing here let me zoom in here so you can see these aren't like super slow like sometimes i'll go really slow to get the wobble in there these are just kind of normal speed lines and and they look nasty they look absolutely horrible the other thing that was happening in sketchbook is i was getting these palm recognition dots i should point out i'm wearing a drawing glove people ask that in every video and the main reason i wear that is is not so much to reduce these uh palm rejection dots the main reason is because it's august and it's hot and my hand sweats and sticks to this smooth glass screen there is a way to turn on streamlining with these lines which is how i drew most of this character so your wine will start really jittery but when you let go it'll come in there and it'll smooth it out for you so there are some ways around that if you choose to go this route let's jump over to photoshop here and i'm going to go ahead and create a new document really quick because in photoshop i feel like i'm getting better performance than i do in an app like sketchbook now you do see some wiggle to the lines but it's you know it's not as bad as what we were seeing before let me undo that brush stroke and let me get some lines in here just some normal speeded lines i'm making up words here as i go and you can see there's some jitter to these i can turn on smoothing in photoshop and once i get it up to about 20 percent you see these lines get pretty nice actually those look pretty good so there are ways to turn on smoothing and to get this pen looking better than it was before this also has smoothing on but i'm going to just kind of go through the pressure and the pressure curve is okay it it seems to at times take a little while to turn on it has i would call it a strong initial activation which means you have to apply more force before it starts happening so if i just drag it across the screen nothing i start applying force and then i get a line so if you're really light drawer this probably isn't going to be a good fit for you so overall i would rate this pen a c minus if you use smoothing and if you don't have to worry too much about the the initial activation force it's okay it works you can create good artwork with this if your software is helping you out a little bit if you need that perfect pen feel if you're looking for something really smooth and really nice out of the box without having to worry about doing all these edits and customizations this is probably one to pass on let's talk about those pros and those cons the pro is definitely the price here getting this form factor at this price can be a little bit hard to come by it seems like as soon as you get into the convertibles or the tablet e space the price starts getting really really high i saw some configurations on amazon of the same exact laptop except it had better specs but it was only a little bit more and overall generally i thought that the price versus value that you're getting for this and the way you can customize those specs on hp's website was was a very good value if you're an artist what it comes down to is you have to ask yourself is do you need a great pen and if you need a great pen like the perfect pen this probably isn't the laptop for you if you are looking to take notes or just want a pen to use on the side or want to do some light sketching from time to time or take up a new hobby i think this is a fantastic laptop in fact in general i thought it was a very good value obviously it's not a super powerful laptop so if you're doing drawing and illustration you're going to be just fine if you're going to go into 3d work or you want to use it for gaming i'm not so sure so that was the nvx 360. what do you think is this something that you're interested in do you want to see more reviews of windows all-in-ones let me know down below in the comment section thank you guys for watching and i'll talk to you in a couple of days", "fJcZH5_0hoM": "hey everyone in today's video we are going to take a look at adonis now - this is the second generation of a donut snap which is a fine point stylus designed for iOS devices this is said to support iphone 6 all the way up to the new iPhones the ones with the knotch let's do a very quick unboxing to see what you get in this box so this is the stylus there's this piece of metal here you're supposed to stick this small flat piece of metal to the back of your phone so they can snap less dollars to it so this is on the back of the foot you can just snap your stylus on to it and this will let you have access to your stylus all the time at the back of your phone behind this cardboard is the USB charging cable this is micro USB which goes to the back of the stallers and this is the usual USB port the design is very compact this actually reminds me of those flat pieces of chewing gum this is very flat and it's very lightweight but construction the boot quality feels very solid this Dallas is available in three different colors there's the green there's the pink and there's the black the metallic surface has a matte texture to it it's really nice to hold that's the power button which doubles up as a remote when you are taking photos and that's the light indicator that's the one point nine millimeter tip there are some texture on it so this provides extra friction and gives you a bit more control when you are writing and drawing with it to use the stylus you have to turn it on first by pressing the button the battery life is supposed to last 10 to 12 hours now this stylus suppose iOS devices so if you're using iPhones or iPads it shouldn't work I have already paired my stylus with the iPad you do not need to pair it with your iOS devices in order to use it for writing or drawing but if you do pair it you have the additional feature of being able to take photographs using this a button which works as a remote bluetooth pairing is very simple just click the button again and a name of the device should show up and just select it and it should be connected so take photos with the stallers with the remote you have to open up the camera app first this is the camera app on the iPad and to take a photo you just have to press the button once you would take one photo if you press and hold the button it would take three photos in a burst the photo taking feature is only available on iOS if you are using an Android phone you can still use the stylus just that you will not have access to the photo taking feature so here I have with me as my Android phone let's test out the writing experience alright the writing experience is actually quite nice that's because of the textured tip it has the additional friction when writing on glass and it's not that slippery so it has good control and writing this Dallas does not support pressure sensitivity and palm rejection so the thin and thick lines that you see here they are actually determined by the app this is actually the writing style of the app so for quick lines like this the line is going to be thick for slow lines the line is going to be thin and there is no pun rejection so there is no way for you to rest your palm while writing this is not so much of a problem if you are using a phone because are most of the time you may be holding a phone like this and writing so you're not really resting your hand on the screen but if you are using a tablet then you have to make a more conscious effort to lift up your pump to lift up your hand while you're writing and now let's test the writing ability on iOS running performance here is actually better compared to Android I can see that is able to capture my handwriting more accurately there are some misalignment issues with the iPad okay now the iPad is in horizontal orientation and I'm using the pen like this with the pen sort of horizontal just like the iPad so I'm going to draw some straight lines now the lines they appear as if they are directly believed tip which is good but when I turn my pen in this direction in this angle you can see the misalignment let me just rotate the pen again you can see where the line is coming from it's to the side of the pen tip so and I'm using the iPad horizontally I need to use that pen horizontally as well in order to avoid the misalignment if I using like this for example if the iPad is in portrait orientation and I'm using it like this and I'm going to get the misalignment let me show you again pay attention to where the line appears beneath the tip I'm going to change the angle of the pen and now it appears the line is directly beneath the tip this is the iPad pro the performance of the iPad pro is better compared to the iPad non Pro and the iPad non-pro is better compared to that on the Android phone here the iPad pro is able to capture my handwriting really well there is still some misalignment but it's not as obvious compared to the iPad non pro so the performance of this dollars will depend on the app and the device that you are using by the way this app that I'm using this is welcome and blue paper there's another problem that I encountered on the iPad non pro so notice as I'm trying to draw some vertical lines I get broken lines and sometimes the lines they do not appear I have narrowed down the problem to Bluetooth so when I turn off the Bluetooth the performance somehow is better but still I get occasional broken lines or missing lines I get that broken line problem on the iPad pro as well both are running iOS 12.1 so you see there's one missing line here and unbroken line here on the Android phone there is absolutely no issues that always broken lines or missing lines unfortunately I do not have an iPhone so I cannot show you how the stylus actually works on it but I did went down to Apple Store to test the stopped us on their iPhones so this screenshot that you are looking at this is from the iPhone 10 our I was only able to use the default Notes app and this was what I wrote the stylus and the Notes app were not able to capture my handwriting accurately you can see that Alliance they are quite wobbly they are very loose very jiggly Wiggly this is not good this is not good compared to other services that I have tried but that's not the biggest problem the bigger problem is when the tip is close to the screen without touching the screen when you move that tip around it would actually create a stroke so this stylus it can create a stroke without the tip touching the screen when it's close enough and that is quite awkward to use when you are writing you have to make a conscious effort to live there pen tip a bit higher than usual to avoid it creating unwanted strokes so that their screen shot was from the iPhone 10 are this one that you are looking at right now this is from the iPhone 10s and the performance is no different so when you're drawing when you're writing you can get jiggly lines and this is more obvious when you are drawing diagonal lines slowly this is not good this is not good at all to conclude I'm quite surprised that this dollars actually works better on the Android phone and the iPads compared to the iPhones that I have tested which is really weird because this stylus that on it step 2 was designed for the iPhone now of course the apps that you use will matter a lot but even with the default Notes app if the stylus is good it should perform decently but that is not the case with the iPhone and the issue with the style is making a line without the pen tip even touching the screen that makes it a bit awkward to use and it's prone to creating astray strokes and mix your handwriting and being more wobbly as well if you do want to buy this stylus I highly recommend you check out other reviews especially reviews that feature the same note-taking apps that you use because performance really depends a lot on the apps that you use now I probably wouldn't recommend this telus but I would recommend you check out other Donuts Tallis's there's one that is quite alright that's the donut - 3 you may want to check that out I have a review for that as well on my blog and YouTube channel links are in the video description below that is all I have to say about a donut snap - if you have any questions let me know in the comment section below I hope this video is helpful thanks for watching see you in the next video bye", "8Ot_Zd80ZfM": "hey guys I'm dream review on a touchscreen stylus this one is made by AK smart here um and it comes in black and white I have here the jack black is called the AK capacitive stylus pen combo this is kind of like alumina aluminum like material so it's nice and strong can you hear this anyway is not some flimsy plastic which is nice so it should be nice and strong a little dirt little more durable and I'm on one and you have the pen so this I'm sure you'll use every day but make sure you don't put it on the other end because it won't fit so make sure you don't lose a cap but um this is one and on the other end that's where you'll find a stylist um you this Dallas is a little of a bigger tip then than usual so it's good for your iPad because it's just a bigger screen overall there is a clip so you can clip it to your shirt pocket or inside compartment of your bag or your a case ipad case the stylist will work on any touchscreen device not just the ipad so any samsung galaxy out there some iphone ipod touch things like that it will all work for HTC the tip is kind of like a rubbery material and is nice and spongy so it is not so hard that you worried that it will damage your screen um and it looks like is as a material that can last because quite flexible and and it the response rate is pretty good so you don't need to apply a lot of pressure when using the of salads so so oh then let's do an MMO that would be better than me talking so first thing you go to maybe show you with the drawing board and touch to draw and you can just draw whatever this will be good if you're doing a presentation a small group presentation and you want to show things like perhaps a graph how your sales is going or just normal things different or if you are designer where placement of the sofa or things like that oh well apparently I can't draw but you get my point other than that you can use it for your email or or just a simple note email things like that and instead of using your finger you can use this dallas to type away so the response rate as i was saying it's very good and you there is no need to apply a lot of pressure so there you go um there are few reason why you may want to use a salad one is it avoid all the fingerprints so the salad because it's a rubber-like material it doesn't leave a trace so if you're like me like to have play with your ipad i already done touchscreen device when you're having lunch so you can't have your fake out your french fries and not leave any greasy fingerprints on the screen so keep it nice and clean so that's nice and um and because you may forget to bring your salads because it is something extra but because it is a pen who doesn't need to who doesn't bring a pen to to school or to work so this n will will make sure that you don't forget to bring your stylist and for the ladies if you like to grow your nails grow your nails and if you find it hard to tell you because you have to kind of bet your finger like so then use yourselves and let let the solid point or tap for you oh and those who have bigger hands I don't have that problem our men who are generally bigger hand or a woman they may find some of the especially on the iphone the key the key are a little too small so sometimes they make mistake because they're touching both full keypad both key at the same time so it's not that precise by having a tip salas tip you can press on the keys and make sure that you know that you'll be more quickly precisely make sure that you're not pressing on two keys with your fingers um what else Oh another thing is if you guys don't know already that you can't use your touch screen when you are wearing glove so just to demonstrate here some sort of glove you won't be able to use the touchscreen you have to use your fingers so in the wintertime if you're waiting for the bus or whatnot keep your glove on stay warm use your spell's and play with your test screening device um I know that like it the spells is not for everyone so my thoughts on this a case Dallas is because it's not for everyone and because not that pricey I say why don't you buy something like this a pen with a gadget fill in which is a stylist you may end up using the stylus a lot more than you dim you may think but um if not if you don't end up liking your stylist at least you have a pen which you be using anyway and because you can do you can refill your pen this will last you a long time too so that's my thought thank you for watching my review", "GcStnN4e1Ho": "hi there folks Gareth here and mobile fun have sent over an elixir hex stylee six in one stylist pan this is 999 it's a stylus and it should hopefully be compatible with them all manner of tablets and things okay so we'll have a quick look around up we've got damn obviously a stylist at the bottom and there you can see it there I'll take it out obviously there's ballpoint pen included a slotted screwdriver very handy a rule a spirit level and a Phillips screwdriver know about a collection of items it's almost like a Swiss Army knife but for ten points where we have a norm texturized applications of said descriptors so there's a stylus ballpoint pen screwdriver rule spirit level and that other pen you know we have a diagram on the back of how it works sec small ultimate accessory forced tablet smartphone users doesn't mention compatibility high ever given it's got this type of stylus on it it should be good with anything that's capacitive okay and we have the readme that's very nicely present that I have to say stylus pen those things again a picture of what you have stylus for touchscreens reveal to dirt twist to reveal screwdrivers textured grip twist for pan refillable black ink be interesting to see what type of cartridge it ticks and that's about it straight to the point very simple ol XR okay so we'll start at the top and work our way down where we have the stylus it's one of those typical rubber spongy ones I don't really know how to judge if that's good or not I know that I had one of these once before my child when he was about one decided to eat it and he he never reported as to whether or not it was tasty but he managed to continue to eat it's almost taste entirely unpleasant there we have the screwdriver pace both hands not obviously fits in elsewhere there's nothing else down there to report I'll just put it back in there for safekeeping for the moment because I like to drop things yeah mmm clip so that it doesn't follow your pocket too easily it's actually I figured from the picture or not from the picture but at least from there that it was rind but it's not hexagonal is that 123456 and Alex are browning there there you go believe me there there's the rule centimeters inches now that we're leaving the European Union we can get rid of these centimeter things spirit level here is there the bubble there is the bowl very handy I'm for a bit of DIY and the grip at the bottom we twist the grip and the well the ink nozzle comes out as per usual and then what do we do to get the screwdriver again twist reveal screwdrivers we yank it apart and we find the ink cartridge inside and there it is small okay I wouldn't be a great designer because it would appear that I overcomplicate things in a grip many ways so we take the top off and there we have a screwdriver you can swap it rind this way around and then use it as a screwdriver if it fits in there we go holes in place doesn't move so that is the screwdriver and then recap it so dead simple very nice multi-tool much like a Swiss Army knife the elixir pan of many tasks but I think actually least of all it's probably a stylus neither the more I look at it damn it does everything and just has a stylus added to it because really that's all it is that's the stylus this is a whole thing built around the idea of just being able to make the status more comfortable to use so yeah it's actually it's made of it's very much metal construction the whole way down I'm thinking that maybe plasticky metal that's plastic this does feel fairly metal it is well constructed very strong that's metal too and obviously the tip of the pan there is at least plastic coated in metal so yeah nice product very simple to the point simple gift for someone who is of maybe you leave it tacky and should work quite nicely in most environments okay so thanks for watching you", "nb8R58k7Esg": "hey everyone in today's video I will be comparing the Microsoft's the best pan with some surface pan eternities this video is made for those who are thinking of getting a stylus for your Windows tablet but not sure which one to get more specifically I will be testing their handwriting and drawing capabilities and now we also be talking about the features there is a pod but overall all these five starters that I have today they support pressure sensitivity palm rejection and they have shortcut buttons all right let me introduce you to them this is a donut Inc the donut ink is a hot tip stylus that is made by the company donut which is known for their iPads Tallis's so for this particular Windows stallers it has two side buttons the battery is built-in so you do need to charge it using the micro USB cable that is provided the charging port is right here at the back the equality for all Internet starters they are fantastic very nice view and the design looks really good this is Donna Inc this is us that is six dollars currently on amazon.com and this is a donut ink Pro which was released later more recently compared to this and there are two sec buttons as well the additional features of this stylus over the Adani ink is it has a laser pointer and it has voice-activated katana so there is actually a microphone here where you can press a button to activate Cortana so those are just two features that this stylus has that the normal ink does not have in terms of pricing this is us $90 and it's currently only so on and on its website so this is a bit pricey the battery for this is also built-in and the charging port is here it uses this charging dock that's provided it's USB so you have to put like this so these are the only two houses that have built-in battery battery life is actually quite good and both look pretty stylish so let's take a look at the NYX Windows pen this is the pack dot S Pen there are two side buttons here the build quality is very solid as well this is full metal body just like the others no back button here and the battery is removable so it uses the battery with 4s it's a very small battery the battery for this stutters that use this sort of batteries they can last for months so that's fantastic and you don't need to charge this battery because it's removable so this is a hot tip stylus as well and this is prized at 31 US dollars I think this is probably the one that is most worth the money because of the pricing and we have Wacom Bamboo ink the stars that I bought recently there are three buttons two side buttons here and one button on the back the battery inside is removable as well the size of the battery is the same as the back door as pen as well as the surface pen this is also a hot tip stylus the quality is fantastic and compared to the other starters this Wacom Bamboo ink it has a matte surface body which is really nice to our home and triangular body very ergonomic and lastly of course we have oh I've got mention the price of this the Wacom Bamboo ink is 45 US Dollars and lastly we have the Microsoft Surface pen which is currently selling at us $80 on Amazon so the surface pen has one side button here it has one back button here the battery it's inside you just have to pull up the back and this is the same for a battery battery life lasts or months the build quality of service pen is fantastic but the build quality of all these losses they are all very good so big quality is not a defining feature of this phase pen what I like about the surface pen is the tip you see this light gray part here this is a soft to firm tip it's not a hot tip like those are hot plastic tips you find on other starters with a tip like this it feels like a felt tip it gives you more friction so it gives you more control when you are writing and drawing this sort of tip is good for drawing where you don't want the tip to be so slippery but when it comes to writing hot tips they work better compared to these soft tips and with the surface pen you can replace this tip with hot tips or you can choose to use felt tips like this the only other style is that you can have this sort of tip swapping is the Wacom Bamboo ink so you can show about this hot tip we have the slippery tip this also has some texture on it the tips for this three-stall sister - donnie inks and the peck dot they are hot tips and you cannot swap them out for Wacom Bamboo ink they come with some replacement tips already so if you don't like this tip that you have you can swap it out straight away but for the Microsoft Surface pen it comes only with this tip and if you want a more slippery tip for handwriting then you have to buy additional tips when it comes to compatibility like which tablet devices can be a solace s work on the Microsoft Surface pen can only work on Microsoft's of its products but this fall pens here they can work on a wider range of Windows tablets like those tablets that are made by Acer issues HP down but just to be sure that you are getting a stylus that is compatible with the device that you are using be sure to check out the company's website for their compatibility list when it comes to features the Microsoft Surface pen is already paired to the surface product automatically you don't have to do anything extra I can just start using it straight away as long as there is power in sight and when you press this button on the back it's going to call up the OneNote app for you to take notes very quickly this button also doubles up as an eraser this is the right click button depending on the app that you use you may be able to configure the functionality of the buttons but the ability to customize is very limited and that applies to your this pen I mean the ability to customize the button functions very limited for all those pens for the surface pen alternatives if you want to customize the shortcut buttons you have to pair them first with your Windows tablet it's not done automatically like the surface pen but if you just want to use it for writing and drawing you don't have to do any pairing when your pen it's close to the screen the cursor will appear so this part here no pairing required you can use it you can use all this straightaway adjust that for additional functionality you have to pair these statuses first except for the surface pen let's test out the handwriting now now earlier on when I tried to write with a donut ink there wasn't any lines that's because we've done it in crystallises they have this auto power off function to save battery life but for the other thousands that used the removable battery they are always on you don't have to turn them on just there for this when it's off you have to turn on the power all right let's start by writing so this is a donut Inc this is a donut Inc Pro so as you move this colors close to the screen the cursor will appear this applies to all the artists Alice's alright for some reason the ink one pro is able to capture my handwriting more accurately compared to the ink Pro if I want to write a bit neater I actually have to go a bit slower so let me redo this again slightly better performance that sometimes there is some issues with The Strokes for example here notes I'm very sure I wrote it like this but somehow the lines did not come out like this and this is the stylus from Peck dot this is the cheapest stylus among the bunch not too bad and this is welcome bamboo ink quite good and lastly of course the Microsoft Surface pen now one good thing about a surface pen is you can use the eraser at the back to embrace you do not get this back ariza with other spouses but sometimes certain statuses they have the eraser on this side by the way this app that I'm using this is Wacom Bamboo paper this is the app that is able to capture my handwriting more accurately compared to all the other note taking apps all right let's take a look at the handwriting samples now straight away I can tell that when it comes to handwriting the doughnut ink this one and surveys pen they are better at handwriting at taking notes compared to his three Donna ink Pro the Peck dot and the Wacom Bamboo ink but the performance is not that significant I mean they are all pretty good at taking notes just that for the surface pen and a doughnut in they are much better they are able to capture my handwriting more accurately next we will test drawing ability of this Tulsa's I'm going to start with surveys pen first there is difference between drawing and writing with writing you are writing usually very fast but we've drawing sometimes you need to go a bit slower so for this test I'm going to draw a bit slower and I'm going to test all those diagonal line cheaters this time I'm going to start with the surface pen because the surface pen has the best drawing performance I want to start with this so that you can have something to compare with so I'm drawing this diagonal line very slowly and this is actually pretty good performance of course if you are going to be drawing faster at moderate speed the lines they are going to be smoother but this performance I think it's pretty good the NYX stylus is a doughnut ink so I'm going to draw the same thing again diagonal lines are slowly I can see some jitter [Music] so when comparing side by side like that you can definitely see the difference when drawing at moderate speed like what I'm doing right now little problem at all when drawing slowly you see this jitter going on so this is a doughnut ink this is a doughnut ink Pro seems that performance is slightly better contact to ink non-pro I think there's light Jeter but not too bad see this line here I drew it very slowly and it's pretty straight and also this button here happens to be mapped to the eraser so I can press this button to go into II reason more straight away so for some statuses they do have the original map onto the side buttons so for moderate speed drawing no problem this is the Peck dot pen not too bad it's light wobble there do you see it palm rejection works pretty well how long I have been resting my palm on the screen and not a lot of straight strokes in fact only one so far and yeah so the jitter is quite obvious the last stylus Wacom Bamboo ink the last stylus Wacom Bamboo ink all right this is definitely significant jitter this is very obvious so this pen is definitely not good for drawing I mean take a look at the curves on the lines it is so distracting when you are when you want to draw a straight line and you get something like this but for writing purposes definitely no problem if you're drawing fast also no problem at all so this is the walk home so when it comes to drawing obviously the Microsoft Surface pen has the best performance that's followed by a doughnut ink Pro this three here not good at all so if you have a surface product then obviously go for the surface pen if you are going to be using that stylus for drawing if you have tablets from other companies then donating Pro is the one to get because the Microsoft Surface pen is not supported on products from other companies all right let me give you my overall recommendation the Microsoft Surface pen is the best dollars for Microsoft Surface products when it comes to handwriting the Adhan ink non-parole this is a very good stylus for handwriting and it's not that expensive the NYX stylus that is good for writing and that is not too expensive is the pen dot has pen while drawing purposes on one surface products go for the doughnut ink Pro if you want a lot of shortcuts go for the welcome bamboo ink three shortcut buttons that you can customize with your Windows tablet so that's all for this comparison review if you want even more detail reviews for each of these sources I have individual text and video reviews for all of them the links to them will be in the video description below so check them out thanks for watching see you in the next video bye", "O400flUyQfU": "the apple pencil 2 is hands down my favorite accessory for the ipad it's a note taker a stylus a drawing pencil and so much more but at 129 it's one of the more expensive accessories that apple offers so let's find out can a 17 apple pencil clone from china really be a better cheaper alternative i mean no what no obviously not but what kind of compromises should you expect from a product like this let's take a deeper comparison between these two in this episode of let's see if this cheap chinese knockoff is any good or i don't know this is what they call it on the website anyways let's see what we get in the box there's no seal on this for some reason and here's the pencil itself yeah i'm a professional youtuber can you tell anyways we got some accessories in the box we've got a pencil case sleeve i might actually keep this for myself honestly a charger what the hell is this charging method what is this and some spare tips alright so what i have here is my 2018 ipad pro i was using it to monitor the shot as you can see let's get rid of my original apple pencil and play with the knock off a little bit okay so pairing is really strange okay so you press the power button and then you got to go through this process of going to your bluetooth settings turning it off and then turning it back on again then somehow that pairs a pencil to the device it doesn't even ask you to select a device so that's really weird all right let's talk about writing now i'm a big fan of taking notes with the ipad i take a lot of notes and i really mean a lot of notes so having a good pencil stylus is important to me all right i'm gonna make a new document and i'm just gonna write some lines get a feel for both of the pencils and compare the two okay so that feels all right it feels like a bit more pressure was on the ipad when writing but that's totally usable all right let's move to the apple pencil by the way i'm sure you've noticed that yes i am left-handed statistically there's a 10 chance that you the person watching this is also left-handed so if that's you let me know in the comments alright that felt really familiar the pressure is definitely more distributed with this one and as you can tell there are variances in the strokes of my writing as a fake pencil has a lot more uniformity in the strokes i think i have an idea why but man i would absolutely love taking notes with this pencil for sure i have no complaints with it it's a joy to use but what if you're an artist let's hop into procreate and see what i believe is the gotcha of this pencil ah just as i thought yeah unlike the original apple pencil which has pressure and angle sensitivity this pencil has none of that so what you see is what you get just constant pressure all the time so is this the best pencil for artists i'm gonna say no unfortunately that's a bit of a deal breaker for me at least you're better off just getting the original apple pencil it would be able to offer you so much more but i know not everyone's going to care about drawing so let's just say you want a basic stylist you know you're an avid pro user and you want to get some photo editing done on lightroom here are some of the thumbnail shots i took for the last video honestly dude this is really nice and super usable it's just a general stylus if this is all you wanted to do with your ipad i have no problem recommending this for that all right let's charge it with the apple pencil 2 charging is really painless as i'm sure you all know you just snap it to the side and boom you're charging simple as that this pencil's charging method is a bit less elegant i have never seen a plug like this before in my life you plug it into the end of the pencil this feels explicit and you plug it in assuming you have a usb port near you um i guess if all you have is your ipad i guess you gotta bring out a hub or something yeah this isn't really pretty or elegant i'm sure there's a usb-c variant on aliexpress for the same price if i can find it i'll leave it in the description i'm sure this makes charging a lot easier if you can just use the same cable to charge everything but as you can tell i'm not too impressed with this aspect of the pencil lastly in terms of swapping out tips apple does sell replacement tips for their pencils they make it really simple to just unscrew it swap it out and put a new one no problem but just be warned you are going to be paying quite a bit for it the knockoff pencil does come with its own tips but my god good luck trying to get this thing off this thing is on there really really tight i was considering maybe it wasn't even designed to be taken off and once you do use up those replacements i honestly don't know where you're supposed to get more i think they just expect you to buy another pencil or something i i don't know alright so other than those glaring issues that i mentioned earlier so far the impressions for this pencil have been pretty good however this pencil has one thing up its sleeve that the original apple pencil doesn't have backwards compatibility so i have here the 2019 10.2 inch ipad it's just the regular ipad i bought it for my mother for christmas last year and bless her heart for letting me borrow it and as you can see switching from the ipad pro to the 10.2 inch is seamless you just pair like before by turning off and on bluetooth and off you go for a budget oriented device like this this makes a lot of sense honestly you don't give up much other than just pressure sensitivity really and yes from what i can tell this works on literally any ipad with apple pencil support whether it be gen 1 or gen 2. okay so should you pick this up i'd say as a general writing tool and just like as a stylus if that's all you wanted to do i don't see any reason why you wouldn't pick this up over something like a real apple pencil for 100 or even 130 this especially makes a great purchase if all you have is one of the older ipads that only have gen 1 support because i mean for 70 less you're basically only giving up pressure sensitivity and if your use case doesn't need pressure sensitivity you're saving 70 bucks you can go buy food with that or something now in terms of it being a feasible alternative to the apple pencil 2 i'm gonna say no honestly you're giving up a lot of the little creature comforts and conveniences that you get on the higher end pencil that you're gonna miss out on this one for example i noticed while doing my writing test that i instinctively double tapped the pencil while i was trying to erase something um yeah this pencil doesn't give you that um the charging is unnecessarily complicated as you saw earlier and honestly this might be cheap and shallow of me but i feel like if you're dropping almost a hundred dollars on an ipad pro um i feel like you kind of have the money or your work case or your use case kind of warrants spending an extra 130 on a good apple pencil too it's feature-rich you know i mean you got all the nice stuff like wireless charging pressured and tilt sensitivity double tap gestures i mean everything really it's thinner too i just noticed that oh my gosh but if you do end up using this with your apple pencil good news because it seems that the fake pencil actually sticks magnetically to the side of your ipad pro regardless so hey maybe no one will actually notice if you want to pick up one of these yourself i'm going to leave a link in the description where you can get it and let me know what you thought i mean does this suit your needs like is is this a feasible alternative for you or does the cons just outweigh the price personally i'm going to actually be giving this to my mother because she has an ipad 10.2 inch and like she really wanted writing style this is honestly the perfect for what she needs she just wants to use it to take notes so this is great let me know in the comments uh hopefully you enjoyed a look at this comparison between these two devices i i thought it was really neat um consider leaving a like if you enjoyed the video and thank you for watching you", "g4wQ8M_5ZRU": "hey everyone this is teal welcome to another product review donut has sent over a new stylus for me to check out and this is the donut ink this is a stylus that is made specially to work with Windows tablet devices more specifically the Microsoft Surface devices and also selected windows touchscreen devices like those two-in-one computers alright so in today's review I will be doing some demo with this stylus and also compare it with our surface pen the donut ink comes in three different colors the one that I have here is blue there are also the black and silver body options that you can choose the design looks very simple as a cylindrical body we have a matte smooth metallic body and this is actually quite nice to touch and to hold in hand these dollars is slightly lighter compared to the surface pen but overall it feels quite nice to hold one of the highlights for this dollars is the 1mm tip I really like the design of this tip because when you are drawing this tip it doesn't block off the lines that are being Navy so this is a very functional design now it may seem that the tip has some matte surface on it but actually when you are using it on the glass surface it is definitely mostly pretty compared to the microsoft surface pan and this tip is removable and replaceable so if it gets worn out you can just unscrew this and replace it with another tip that is so separately it takes a while to unscrew this but it looks like this when you put the tip back into the pan make sure to screw it on tightly I find out sometimes when I'm drawing it gets loose a bit so I have to screw it back on again so make sure to screw this on very tightly here's how the tip of Don ink compares to the Apple pencil and the phase pen 2017 there are two site buttons on the stallers this first button here and this has been configured to the eraser function and this button at the back that's the right click now to switch on the stallers you just have to press down the first button here for two seconds and green light will light on and to switch it off you have to press both buttons and wait for the red light to come on and it will turn off so there's actually a battery in sight that is rechargeable you have to charge it through this pot at the back this is a micro USB charging pot and the only other accessory that comes with this pen is this charging cable so this site will go into the back of the pen and this is the USB connector natural eyeball this dollars is rated to last 480 hours so if you draw non-stop each day for 10 hours straight is going to last you 8 days and that's pretty decent battery life but definitely not as long compared to the 6 months to one year's battery life on the surface pen you know as this little clip here at the back so what are the main physical differences between a doughnut ink and surveys pen well the first thing is the tip so this tip here is mostly pretty compared to that tip on the surface pen the surface pen tip has more friction and provides slightly better control when it comes to drawing on the surface pen there is only one side button that's the right click button on the doughnut ink we have the right click button at the back and this button here is mapped to the eraser and on the back of the surface pan we have the eraser but on the doughnut pink the eraser is mapped to this button and lastly there is a strong magnet inside a surface pen which allows it to snap very tightly to the side of the surface pro this makes it very easy to transport pen around unlike the surface pen which is always on before you can use the donor ink you have to switch it on first but thankfully it's very quick you just have to press this for one to two seconds and the green light will turn on to switch off the stallers you have to press both buttons at the same time the thing is I always forget to switch off the stylus and so far the battery life it has been quite all right so I suppose the pen would switch itself off after a pair of inactivity and just like the surface pen this stylus also supports palm rejection and pressure sensitivity however I'm not too sure how many levels of pressure that is add on ink can support but it's definitely not as sensitive compared to the surface pen so now I'm going to launch some graphic apps to show you the strokes that you can create let me launch MIDI Bank paint pro first I'm going to draw a series of strokes on the left side we have Adana ink and then switch over to using surveys pen to draw the same strokes on the right side so that you can compare the differences and I'm not sure if you can see clearly but there is this cursor here so this is an active pen that's why there is the cursor that follows the tip around and this is why you can get perfect palm rejection I'm now drawing a slight Lea as possible with Donna ink and let me switch over to the surface pan again I'm drawing very lightly what I can say for certain is the surface pan is more sensitive when it comes to drawing very lightly so you can get thin lines like this very easily as long as the tip is touching the glass screen you can get very light and thin lines like this however if I were to do the same with a doughnut ink the lines that I get will be slightly thicker compared to the surface pan and now I'm going to draw some diagonal lines very slowly to see if there is any jitter of the line wobbles I will say that there is slight jitter but it's not as bad compared to other stallers that I have used let me compare that to the Sufis pen from what I can see the lines from the surface pen they definitely have less jitter compared to a Donna ink that I would say that this type of performance this is actually considered quite respectable especially when you compare it to other types of Solace and now let's see how a donut Inc handles curves here's a close-up of what I have just drawn so for this part here this is definitely not as smooth as I want it to be so there is some variation in terms of thickness and here you can see that this line is Pat here it's not able to get me and uniform stroke when I was drawing like this I noticed that this is a problem when I'm drawing thicker lines or thinner lines I usually do not get those variations in stroke maybe because I'm not using any pressure at all and now let's switch over to using the surface pen and see what I can get with the surface pen the lines are smoother and the lines came out exactly the way I want them to be and also the transition between thin and thick it's also very gradual very smooth so does this mean that Adana ink is not good for drawing well I think it's got to do with what you draw and what you used a stylus for for example now I'm drawing a cartoon character with a lot of curves and overall it still works quite well so sometimes the strokes may have some variation in terms of thickness for example here I can see some slight variation but overall it's still quite smooth let's test out the eraser which is mapped onto this first button so I'm going to erase this part here which I have accidentally overdrawn so let me just press that button and just erase it slightly so the eraser works with minimal paint pro this is sketchball that's compared to 2000 so that's a donut Inc and this is the surface pen that's zoom in so for this line here again I can see that it's not smooth there's the variation in thickness here and also here and also here but for the phase pen you can see that it's really very smooth let's draw the same thing again most of the curves are smooth but some parts are definitely not as smooth for example here let's try some hatching I think it works quite well with hatching let's switch over to Sophie's pen so for hatching I'll say that a doughnut ink it performs almost exactly the same as the surface pen let's try and draw a diagonal line very slowly so I can see some jitter let's switch over to a surface pen almost no jitter at all the eraser works here as well I want to show you mischief with mischief I can see that the lines are exceptionally smooth there is almost none of the jitter so the transition between thin to thick it's very smooth very gradual and even for the thick lines I do not see any of those jitter so for mischief I think they probably do some sort of software correction to the strokes to make them a bit smoother this is Krita so with Krita the effect a jitter is even more pronounced and this is Photoshop everything looks quite smooth here with Photoshop so the performance of the stallers is definitely dependent on app that you use this is Wacom Bamboo paper one of my favorite apps for taking notes and it curves here they are very smooth let me do some handwriting sample miss witch over to using the surface pen both styluses are quite good at taking notes and here my hair writing from both the star says they are captured quite accurately because this tip here is a hot tip when writing you're going to get those tapping songs all right so what's my overall recommendation when it comes to drawing the surface pen performs better compared to a doughnut ink when it comes to drawing lighter lines the surface plane is more sensitive and when comes to drawing heavier lines the donating sometimes can have that jitter effect the lines may not be as smooth compared to the surface pen if you are going to use the stylus to draw very often I would recommend surface pen if you are just using the stylus to draw occasionally to take some notes or if you're just looking for general purpose stallers then a donut ink may be enough to suit your needs and this is much more affordable compared to the surface pen that's all for today's review I hope this video is helpful in some way if you have any questions and let me know in the comment section below thanks for watching see you in the next video bye you", "R_yIQokT0ec": "hey guys I hope that wasn't us jump scare or anything it's just you know I don't want to I don't want to show my face because I'm going through my laser transformation I said it and being as honest as I possibly can and I hope you guys understand I'm being very literal anyways I am going to be doing a product review for the first time and I'm super excited I am going to review this super cool stylist by Adonit or a donut I don't know how to pronounce company name they sent this stylus to me to review so you know full disclosure and yeah I am super excited I don't know how to do reviews this is the pro 3 stylist it is a universal stylist which means it will work with pretty much any device it has a touch screen Yesi for all touched returns there and I didn't even read that part and then I give some louisette a little dirts I give some cool details in the back in many languages that I cannot read besides English and maybe Spanish and it tells you that it is a it is compatible that's the word with Android and Apple devices so let's get this baby open I will admit that I opened it early on because I was way too excited to check it out and there we go this is the stylus very cute and small and it's very nice color it comes in a couple different colors I'm pretty sure it comes in besides silver when it comes in black I think a dark blue and it comes in rose gold which I was a low key but kind of high key hoping they would send me that one but you know what I like this color as well very nice it has a textured grip if my camera can focus you see that right there we see if you can hear it you hear that very nice I really like how it feels and the cap is magnetic so it's way easier to keep track of because you can actually stick it in the back like that I just learned this recently there you go there is a tip right there you can see there is a plastic disc at the end of it and if you look super close look at that teeny teeny tiny oh no you need teeny-tiny tip right there for precision I guess I don't know who listen I don't know how to design a stylus design-wise really like it but it is time to test out if it works well on the device itself so technically I have two devices with a touchscreen which is my Kindle in my iPhone but I carry my iPhone everywhere compared to my Kindle and I've always wanted a stylus just because when I'm not at home which is pretty often I sometimes feel like drawing or doodling or whatever whatever and it's really hard to draw with my finger there's just not enough precision so I'm really hoping that this gets the job done so I have four different I'm so sorry for the glare I have four different drawing apps on my phone they are all free and I thought it would be best to try on different apps just so it would give the stylus a fair chance you know just to see which apps work best so I'm gonna try it on there medibang drawing desk sketches and adobe sketch i personally only use medibang just because it's the same company who made fire alpaca so i'm very familiar with how it works and the setup and all that stuff but i am excited to try the other apps as well and let's see how well this stylus works alright so one thing that I did notice about this stylus is that so naturally a draw kind of at an angle like this I would draw like this just naturally but as you can see it's not registering that and that is because the whole you see that plastic disc that I pointed out earlier there's a hair on it I don't know what that is the whole surface of that disc has to be touching the screen in order for it to register which means I am going to have to adjust the angle that I draw at which isn't too big of a deal to be honest it depends on how you know if you're drawing at a super weird angle and you know there's no chance of you being able to adjust yourself I guess that could be an issue me personally not too big of deal there we go I kind of just ignored what I was saying and just went straight for sketching I'm gonna do just a very rough sketch right now of a character facing to the left at a 45 degree angle you know like like I usually do when I'm just trying to do something simple and something that I'm super comfortable with because I don't like to get out of my comfort zone anyways this is a call-out video besides the product review it's a call-out video to myself so so far so good even though it's a super simple sketch and you can't really tell if I put enough of effort in it or whatever I really do like how smooth it glides on the screen absolutely no scratching no squeaky noises which I've had in the past with other styluses so no squeaky noises that is so my ears are so sync thankful for that no scratching on my screen and by the way before I forget because it might look like there's pen pressure because of how I'm drawing this stylus does not include pen pressure it's just like I said just a universal stylus I can use for pretty much anything besides illustration is just to use for navigating your devices or to take notes you know covers pretty much everything but since it is not specifically made for illustration it doesn't really offer pen pressure the reason why it looks like it has pen pushers because I'm using a brush that imitates the look of pen pressure so yeah just making that clear no pen pressure is offered with the stylus so ooh what can I give him like a cat mouth that was a complete accident but I'm gonna go with it I will be completely honest I have not too much experiences with styluses of the store so don't expect anything super crazy amazing whoa I forgot that it doesn't cancel out hand touches but anyways I have seen some really incredible art made with styluses and phones and iPads and whatever so it's not this definitely doesn't hinder you it doesn't stop you from creating super incredible art just myself personally I need or practice this is a very long face you may be wondering Leslie who is this dashing young man and to that I say I don't freaking know it's just another generic demon guy that I draw all the time you know the even guys I draw he has no backstory and probably never will there's a tiny neck do some more updates that I want to talk about there is pretty wise little to no parallax which I am super appreciative of a parallax I should probably look up the definition to be honest to those of you who aren't familiar with the term parallax the definition I'm going to read to you right here the effect whereby the position or direction of an object appears to differ when viewed from different positions through a viewfinder bla bla so in terms of art but with some tablet pants or stylus is when you draw a line you can't really tell where the line is going to come out of because it's just way off I guess either due to lagging or due to the product or the app but as you can see the line I can tell exactly where the line is gonna be because it follows directly behind the point right there the point of as I say the point of impact but I don't think that is a term I'm looking for well I was gonna say I'm I was gonna try to draw a perfect circle as an example but even with the best of items I can't draw a circle I wish I could give a better example of that but it works really well I really like I really like how it turns out who this guy has some big shoulders what a big boy it looks like a nerd I think I designed a nerd that's okay he's beautiful okay so the next app we're gonna try is drawing desk I think I've used this before either my phone or the Kindle I don't know which if it's available for whatever let's see how it works on this one mm-hmm okay fantastic moving on to the next app just because I don't much care for this of course you stop recording why not I don't need that footage anyways right phone alright so the next app I'm gonna try is sketches which is right over here again like I said all of these are free and so far why aren't you clicking there we go and so far all of them have been compatible with this stylus of course Oh beautiful mm-hmm okay that's easy that's a cool effect I guess all right we're gonna move on to the next app don't get me wrong this app is great and it works fantastically with the stylus of course like no surprise but I don't really like the brushes that it offers me so we're gonna be moving on to Adobe sketch right over here um the reason why I wanted to try so many apps was because I wanted to see if there's any difference in the performance of the stylus but so far so good I can already tell I don't this act is gonna be bugging me just by the setup oh right um interesting to be quite honest I am just too lazy to draw the other eye so I'm gonna revert back to my middle-school ways and draw everybody with just one eye and the other ones being covered by hair because why not there's no shame I mean I love it a shame but like I got stuff to do you know I know I'm supposed to be doing a review right now but I'm kind of getting caught up just going to learn some stuff one thing I noticed while I was googling this weird dressed thing is that using this stylus feels like you're using a pen on paper which is really great I was super afraid that it would be I don't want to describe it like uh but sometimes with a lot of different types of products you don't know where the line is gonna be you don't know like the the texture when you hit the stylus or the tablet pen on the tablet or a screen or whatever it doesn't feel natural there's just so many things that could be different but I really do like how this feels all the apps and I chose work really well with the stylus as they should it would be pretty bad if it didn't but I'm glad they all work well like I said no scratches on my screen no like squeaky noises that are that drive me insane the position is very nice and overall I really like this product you can order this stylus online I do prefer online ordering because it feels like somebody got me a present but it was actually myself so thank you pass me for getting future me a gift it does retail at about $30 though so I'm whether or not that is something that kind I want invest in it's all up to you if it does work really well it's very small and compact and I can definitely see myself carrying this in my purse so that when I'm not at home and I need to doodle something or note something down um I will definitely use this but overall I really do like it I wish I had the pink one but you know what that's okay that's okay I can take it I'm a grown woman this is not my secret way of showing off the sweet written that only fits on my middle finger and thumb because it's big and I'm tiny my hands are tiny anyways I don't really know how to end a review video so thank you so much for watching thank you so much to Adonit a doughnut uh for sending me this stylus to review I really do like it and oh I can't get over this part it's really nice it's like the future but in a stylist thank you and please be go to the outlets for me and I'll see you guys next time [Music] you", "4PMPjxQly1s": "this is Lisa from mobile tech review and good times here this is the HP Spectre x-360 we did a video review of that separately so if you want to know everything about the machine watch the video review but this one's focusing on the pen HP kept it in secret really that their HP active pen works with this when do you get the 1080p version that we have here are the Q HD version so you can actually have digital pen input and we're going to look at it now all right this is not a Smackdown between the HP Spectre x-360 and the Microsoft Surface pro 3 but for those of you who are looking for something that can be a tablet and do pen input it's worth considering both of these at the same time just saying service pro 3 uses n-trig pen technology a bit more mature there are things like wind tab drivers available the HP uses the HP active stylus as they call it now you can pick one of these up at Best Buy they're about 40 bucks or so that's what the box looks like if you're trying to find an HP active stylus it says actually loaded that's what the box looks like anyway this is set synaptics technology and for those who've been watching our reviews and products with synaptics inside particularly some of the Dell Venue tablets it's come a long way it's much improved and even as you saw probably the Acer R 13 it's a very usable pen now we're going to try out several art and note-taking applications so you can see how it works alright first we're in OneNote this is the desktop version rather than the metro version you can see I've been writing here so we noticed with synaptics pens before that sometimes you had to write in cursive rather than print because it would miss rapid printing strokes so let's try printing it's actually working pretty well and it's not missing parts of letters or anything like that now you can see you missed a little bit over here my handwriting is really atrocious especially because I'm writing this at a funny angle right now so we can record this on video but overall it works well not that at all so for those of you who are OneNote types you're going to be happy with that and let's take a quick look at the Metro OneNote application as well if anything this one is actually keeping up even a little bit better without losing strokes it's certainly very usable and you can see there's even pressure sensitivity here for a more natural writing experience when writing lightly it's like that if I press hard it works like that so definitely a go for you note-taker type so let's take a look at some art programs fresh paint doesn't always have the best pressure curves they have to try to support a whole lot of pens with the windows ink API and sometimes they just don't get it right okay so here we are in fresh paint and I have a small black paintbrush a sign right now and mmm it takes more pressure than I would expect it's not the worst but this is just in fresh paint right here now let's compare it to a finger stroke see how much broader the finger stroke is so at this you really have to press not terribly her totally hard but you know a bit more than we expected now it's fine if you adjust them fresh paint really doesn't offer a whole lot of customization and what they're doing with pen pressure sensitivity was so there's that and now we're in sketchbook nearly a sketchbook and we are drawing our apple with the wrong color right now pen pressure is pretty good on this now with this program you can customize the pen pressure so if it's sensitivity I have a very light touch so I tend to prefer it when things are a little bit less pressure recording this but this is not bad at all so I can do pretty natural pretty quick stroke now if we do the usual circle test to see pen latency it's fairly good not quite up there with intrigue and wacom but that isn't bad at all so if I really want to sketch quickly yes now I'm going to draw somebody's face right there big scratch it's missing a couple of strokes here and there so for those of you who are serious artists or professional artists you're still going to want to go select the surface pro 3 and n-trig are with one of the Wacom enabled tablet PCs either Wacom zone tablet or perhaps Lenovo ThinkPad but for casual artists those just starting out this isn't too bad I have to say so let's look at our tray jet our range does a very good job of supporting anything that uses the modern Windows ink API for drivers doesn't require wind tab they really spend a lot of time getting pressure right for a whole lot of pens so let's work on drawing our Apple here again lime green apple hey that's cool and this is missing some strokes occasionally still but the pen pressure very light line heavy line does have palm rejection but you can see right there it did pick up my knuckle this has a pretty good hover distance but once in a while you're going to make sure that it sees the pen tip you'll get the indicator on the screen before you rest your hand otherwise you might have a little accident there so at work so let's test the speed here again for that uh-huh occasionally it's missing part of the circle not perfect yet not terrible either certainly enough that you could do a nice sketch with this pretty promising so now we're going to look at Photoshop CC this is the online subscription edition and I was testing out some masking capabilities here with this photograph say I just want to do a lasso selection something photographers are find much nicer compared to using a USB input tablet or even your finger for more precision and it makes masking just that easy so say I want to well create a new adjustment layer or something that I've got that pretty nicely and finally selected without even trying very hard so obviously that works pretty well let's try drawing because the latest version of Photoshop Photoshop CC does support Windows ink API you no longer have to have wind tab drivers now give older versions of Photoshop you still got any wind tab drivers which don't exist for synaptics but here we don't have to have it so let's switch over to our paintbrush tool and this is I didn't even have to change any settings out-of-the-box light line heavy line right there this is not bad or Apple yet again still I see it occasionally lagging behind on a stroke here in there it's it's usable it is not as awesome as Wacom or in trigger becoming it's not bad on I can do a pretty quick fill-in to create a shadow under my Apple there but I go too fast it'll still lose some strokes so there you have it there is the HP active stylus as I call it really I would have called a pen because this is a digital thing this is like capacitive actual has components and it has a quadruple a pin inside you unscrew the barrel right here and probably once every six months or so you're going to replace that teeny little battery in there but it's certainly just fine for note-taking it's decent for art's still not quite up there with the more established competitors but who knows in six months the way synaptics has been moving with this technology it might be that much better so that's the HP spectre x360 pen input demonstration

is ricky the youtube tech guy hey guys so today i am going over how i found a pen for the galaxy fall 2. now i went through two of them the first one i had high ups for but it did not work out as well so i wanted to let people know that it doesn't work the dash 3 is a great capacitive active pen that basically works great with the front screen but does not live up to the hype with the front with the open display so overall this works great on glass it is a very fine tip stylus you could write with it you can do all this kind of stuff but it just didn't work out as well when actually using it on the main screen even with this screen it doesn't work out perfectly as it would otherwise so there's there's certain moments where it just basically doesn't work when trying to write hello um it didn't work on the bottom half so it just has some interruptions that it didn't have with every other phone but it just doesn't work so dash three i love the turn off and on great for any other phone that you do want a stylus for but does not work here so what i ended up going with was the actual real pen that stood out to me and that is from the same company all links will be in the description down below but the the adonet pro 4 now the auto net pro 4 has a different so it doesn't have a tiny uh capacitive stylus but what it does have is a really great design with a touch surface now there's some as low as 13 bucks they didn't quite work as well trust me i've been through a lot but this one really does it just works and you have to get the feel of how plastic feels with this kind of stylus but once you do it really will work for the most part but where it shines instead of drawing or writing is navigation i've already done about three videos with this stylus and it just feels so good to navigate everything you kind of want to in terms of how you want to move with this device it just it fits so well i have used it now for two days and it works perfectly i highly recommend it if you want to navigate with a pen on the galaxy fold 2 this is the one to get all links will be in the description down below this is the best one for the full 2. if you have any other phone that doesn't have a plastic surface though the dash 3 is really good as well so let me know what you guys think in the comment section down below are you going to order this as soon as this video is done let me know thank you as always for watching this has been rcky the youtube tech guy thank you for watching our video if you liked it why don't you go ahead and subscribe up there make sure you follow

again", "DaKQN6JDQxg": "I have here the a donut - three fine points Tyler's a pan that will work with any device Android or Apple iOS so if you have a screen that doesn't support a stylus like it's the case of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 5e you can use this a doughnut let's unbox this package and let's see this magic pan that will work with any device with any touchscreen so this is the package this is the pan or the stylus inside you will have the pen and the charger this is the charger because the pan has a battery that will work the pan has a battery that will work for that will provide functions for 14 hours so after that you can charge it here it has a magnetic clip as you see this is an USB charger you can use it anywhere for example let me take an external battery and let's put it here and after that like this it will charge in 45 minutes and after that you can use it continuously for 14 hours almost one day that's impressive so you don't need any battery anything else just put it here for 45 minutes ok back to the pen it's made from aluminium it has 12 grams or something like this anyway it's very easy it feels great because it has the dimensions of an original pan of a normal pan and you even have this clip to carry it with you I like it here you have an LED it will show you if it's on or off or the battery it's low so here again we have a button if we press it once we have the pan on and now we can use it with any device let's test it this is a tip one point nine millimeters right here because the screen doesn't have polymer ejection you can't hold your pal here and write in the same time so you will have to write like this what can I say from my first interaction I would say it's impressive the span and everything it's premium with it starting with the design with the materials with a feeling and how it works from the screen keep in mind that this tablet doesn't support the device like this so to be able to to write with this it's really impressive let's try to take a note in in this application it seems that you can even use this button to write anyway is not the best way to take hand righted notes but if you use the keyboard for example and this feature the swipe feature let's draw something this is the best way to draw something on this tablet or to take even some notes so in the end should you buy this or not for me definitely it's a great device because I can use it in photo editing in video editing I don't use it for drawings or for notes I believe but for video and photo editing it's a fantastic tool and at this moment this is the best device for any touchscreen tablet smartphone Android or not I don't need it's a premium stylus for any device this is the most important aspect if you want something well made and to work flawlessly on the screen then you should go and try something made by a donut the a donut this - tree it's the latest version because there is a first generation and - - but this one is improved with a better tip great responsiveness and obviously the best because it's their latest stylus anyway for me this tool is fantastic and I will highly recommend it I'm really impressed how it works because don't forget this screen it's not made to work with a stylus even if he is not made to to work to function with the stylus we can use this great tool for this screen so as you see here it's very easy to use it on a smaller screen because you can rest your palm here and you can write it better than on on a huge screen this is my experience at this moment anyway let's draw something here something magnifique thanks for watching please like share subscribe thanks", "x67DHOyzQ_E": "this is the Monte Verde OneTouch stylus tool pen and this is a really neat pen it comes in three different colors

packaging really really nice sleek packaging now this is a stylus pen that will work on all electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets and especially the Apple iPad and the iPhone this is why I bought this because I wanted a Apple pencil but didn't quite want to spend the coin just yet and I want to get a feel for it using a pencil so I opted for this more affordable version right here and I picked this up from Amazon alright guys we're gonna get right into it alright now inside of the box you do get the little instructional pamphlet which isn't much to it because you don't charge this and it doesn't come with any batteries cords or anything like that because you don't have to charge it now you do get this neat little handy dandy carrying case should you want to store it in something cute I just think this is nice that they included this leather like case for the pencil really really nice cute to have in your barriers of the pen now the pant is actually sleek looking I do love the design of the pen it kind of resembles the Apple pin a little bit now it does have the logo here on the end and it does have this little end here that kind of resembles like a clicking point but it doesn't click though does have this little in here that you take off and it has like a magnetic little snap feature here really really strong I love that so you won't lose the cap the only thing that I find weird is this little disc at the end does look a little I do love the sleekness of it I love the design I'm just a little weirded out about this tip now it does come with the extra tip as well it is inside the pen I'll show you that as well and it is easy to change out should you need to change this or replace it like I said it does come with the extra one and it is inside of the pencil and to change let's go ahead and see how it works all right and because if this thing works directly out of the box you don't have to connect it via bluetooth or anything like that it just works out of the gate for you look at that it's flawless seamless it works really really great right now as far as scrolling from different screens very very fluid notes and we're gonna see how it writes using the writing tool function because that's primarily why I wanted to get this pin because I eventually wanted to use planner apps on my iPad and I'm gonna want to use a pin to actually write I love that handwritten look so yeah let's just go ahead and go to the notepad [Music] select the peon here in the corner this tip and let's just use black [Music] oh I like it it writes really good of course my penmanship with me filming and holding the iPad isn't the best but it actually really works good I'm really really enjoying this so far I like it it's really really nice and again I picked this up from Amazon and this was roughly twelve dollars I want to say very very inexpensive I will have the links down below should you want to pick up a stylus pin like this one very very nice very affordable ah I like it let me know what you think of today's video there's something else you want to see me review at right here on this channel leave me a comment down below until next time I

unscrew the the top from the from the barrel of the pen I'll just set that aside and so now the next step we've got to put these little bitty batteries in so what we're gonna do is right here we're gonna look at the at the spring and you can notice on either side of the spring there is a tiny little notch it's nearly impossible to see in this video but there it is so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my fingernail and I'm gonna put it in that notch and I'm just gonna twist to start it using my fingernail it hopefully won't ruin your nails but I don't really have nails to ruin so now I'm gonna untwist that the rest of the way and a tiny little part just like this is gonna come out of the top barrel so now I'm gonna set the top barrel aside what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this black piece out it's got little little nibs right there that are gonna actually help us out a lot so the next step is I'm going to take these two batteries I've got the flat part facing up so the part with letters facing up the negative side with looks like a little black ring on it is is facing down I'm gonna stack them on the table just like that they're stacked on top of one another then I'm going to take this black piece right here and point that see if I can do this I'm gonna I'm gonna put the batteries that are on the table I'm gonna put them inside of that black piece so now I've got the batteries sitting negative side to the open end of a black piece I'm gonna put the black piece back in the barrel of this little tiny piece just like that and now I'm going to put the little tiny piece back in the a small barrel of of the top of the of the active pen active stylus so here this part is all back together now I'm going to take the bigger part and we're gonna put the battery facing the the positive end facing the tip of the pin so top-down into the barrel and now I'm going to just screw in the entire top of the barrel and now we are done it's totally put together you have the option to put the spring on although you may find that it gets in your way you don't have to put the string on but do you save it that's all", "yW3IR-ClYKQ": "[Music] that's nice now let's do a test let's try writing with the stylus you can see how bad writing looks like let's do a good drawing [Music] now let's try making more finished [Music] [Music] so let's talk about its body it is jet black color it has metallic finish and it also had a matte color it also got some weight so it feels very great in hand talking about its features it works really well and have pressure sensitivity the little disc prevents it from scratching the screen you can use it for making artworks as well as writing notes it's wireless and doesn't need to be charged it can be really good alternative for Apple pencil does not need bluetooth or wireless connectivity it can definitely fit in budget it only costs 500 new rupees which is 7.0 at u.s. dollars my rating for this product is 9 out of 10 I strongly recommend this if you are looking for a stylus don't forget to like and share this video", "g8V7PQtOn1Y": "what's going on guys averagetechguy here and today we are back with more tech and more reviews and i did a video a week or so ago just telling you about some of my favorite ipad accessories and i mentioned the switch easy pencil now this is the switch easy easy pencil but this one is the 20 20 model and i think you are going to like this one because it's probably the best alternative to an apple pencil and i'll tell you why in just a moment [Music] so i've already brought you a video about the switch easy pencil now this one is the one over here this is from 2019 late 20 early 2019 late 2018 this pencil was actually one of the first alternative apple pencil devices that i picked up now it was great you can't have your apple pencil connected to this device so let's go ahead and take that off and i normally just turn the bluetooth all the way off 100 you tap on this and it just works right now the model from this year is basically the same you tap on the top blue light comes on and it just works now it does have usb type-c charging right here which is a big plus it does have a swappable tip you get a replacement tip in the actual box itself but let's talk about what goes on with this pencil and the reason it is probably the perfect apple pencil alternative now we know that it let's turn it on so we know that it actually controls the device you still get all your functions such as screenshots it actually works with that new scribble feature so everything is actually great it supports palm rejection i'm just gonna lay my hand on it and just draw draw and draw and draw some more so palm rejection works there's no pressure sensitivity on this so just keep that in mind for all you artists out there this may not be the one for you because the pressure sensitivity is not there but i will tell you this you can write you can use scribble you can have that palm rejection it is very accurate very smooth writing and i actually have a screen protector on here by eye cares it's one of the best that i've used now a lot of people do like paper like this is a matte finish screen and like i said it's still a smooth writing experience it does come with a usb type-c charger in the actual box i'm not sure it's probably still in there somewhere but all that's great and good and all but what most people want to know is where am i going to store this thing what what what do i do with it when i get it when i get this perfect apple pencil alternative what do i do with it that's what you do with it this is the only apple pencil alternative that i've seen thus far that will actually stick to the top not fall off when you wiggle it a really strong magnet no issues whatsoever so the average person looking at this device is gonna say that is an apple pencil it fits like an apple pencil it's magnetic like an apple pencil i'm shaking this is not coming off this is the perfect apple pencil alternative now if you're an artist by all means go out and spend 130 bucks on this because that's your profession that's what you do you need this because it's going to do everything that you need it to do but if you're just the average person who wants an apple pencil and wants that experience go out and get this one you're gonna spend about 40 bucks and it's gonna stick to the top it's gonna have the palm rejection it's gonna have usb type-c charging remember you cannot have this connected while they won't work uh this one won't work if this one is connected so keep that in mind but other than that this thing is the perfect and i mean the perfect apple pencil alternative for the average consumer and that's why i'm here to help out the average consumer make a decision and i think this one is probably one of the best is it's almost 1 4 the price of the the original apple pencil and it's gonna do the exact same thing so i think this thing is a really good investment this is the switch easy easy pencil plus go check it out i'm gonna be sure and drop a link below so you can do that and hopefully that will help someone out until next time be sure and give me that big thumbs up and please subscribe average check out peace", "YyEDN8XN3DE": "so the stock pen which is the marker is actually really really nice by remarkable and if you haven't seen our review of the remarkable yet we will just give you a little bit of inside look of this pen it is a very nice pen it doesn't have any racer on it doesn't have any buttons on it but the tip is very nice it is replaceable you get a lot of tips in the box 10 in total the pen itself has a super high grip on it and there's a very nice stylish line down the middle here it's also so magnetic it snaps to the device and stays there on any part of the device it is of course meant to snap to the side like so but because it is so magnetic it doesn't harm the device either but it snaps to any part of the remarkable itself which is really cool but the point of today's video is this the remarkable marker plus you will see that it does have a built-in eraser and there is no charging or setup needed like the sony pens and other devices like that we are going to open this up and do an unboxing and review all in one because we've never basically used this before so we do not know what to expect ourselves either so when you open it up it looks like you get the same location for the marker tips up top you get all the tips right there and you can actually snap this open and they break out kind of thing so that's really cool to have and the marker itself now there's no documentation or anything else in there but they do tell you to recycle it which is a very very good idea now here is the marker itself they said it's supposed to be higher grip and i agree it is quite high the grit feels ever so slightly more coarse on this this is more fine on the stock pen this one is much more coarse and it's weighted very nicely as well you also have an eraser on the back and it actually dips in a little bit as well so this thing is a little bit nicer than the stock pen it's not night and day because they still lack those buttons on the side but it is quite nice and it's obviously a different color and does have the same level of magnetic properties which i have just figured out right now and it snaps to the device on the back anywhere and on the side yes the pen is quite nice but using the pen on the device is going to be completely subjective because some people are going to say i like this better some people will go with the stock pen but objectively when you use this pen you do have the eraser now the eraser doesn't work as a one tap erase or an area select so even if you choose those on here eraser area selection erase all that does not affect this so basically you have to scrub away and as you're scrubbing away you see it's very gray and only when you let go does it actually erase in full but it does give you the ability to even go on its side and it's very corner it's very tip like this so you get a very high level of accuracy when it comes to erasing if you were to zoom in 500 percent and use the very tip of the eraser you can see your lines can be fairly thin but it's kind of all depends on how hard you press as well so if you press lightly it actually doesn't do anything and if you press too hard the bleed is too thick so it is not as intuitive as you would think but it does get the job done obviously zooming in 500 percent is mostly for the drawing enthusiasts if you were to just be in the full screen standard 100 percent and you're erasing thing as normal it wouldn't be that much of an issue it's just for the people that are more of the hardcore artists will have the reality that this isn't as accurate as you might think it is this 100 comes down to the fact that do you need it black or do you need it gray and do you need an eraser if all of that is worth the extra 70 dollars go for it otherwise you won't really find too much use out of it it is heavier it's not a night and day difference it is extremely subtle and it is a different color that's basically all you can say about this so we just want you to be informed and notice that the eraser is there it is present and it is absent on the pen that you get out of the box if these are the major factors in you making the upgrade go for it if not the stock pen is the way to go for goodyreader.com and a quick unboxing and review of the marker plus this is peter [Music] you", "pnPzl5XqBvk": "hey guys welcome back to my inner channel okay i sound like i kind of sound like james charles but whatever but today i'm unboxing a new package but hope you enjoyed but i know

the hearts of this product so if you're wondering which brand this is this is the brand called elvi it was made they made this and it's kind of decent the price is kind of decent like it's not

it's bad and then you have this guy but if this goes bad i don't know how to help you i i don't know i'm very sorry but let's continue with the next one but let me put it back because it was very satisfying it is made of stainless steel and aluminium for added durability and strength amazing it has a secure cap from protecting from damages it this pen comes with a clear disk and make sure to not damage it because this is what this is what you use for moving this the like the phone screen or like a tablet but let's move on to the next highlight of this product the tip is very sensitive and very accurate while marking ma don't do it hard though it may break the tip thank god you have an extra one but if you but if you but if the extra one breaks i'm sorry i don't have any advice for you let's go onto the next side of the product let's talk about its design i nursed our sentence with a high-pitched voice but there's actually a little thing that you probably saw you guys didn't know you could actually screw back in like in the bottom like same with every normal like writing pen on paper like let's let's continue more talking about design let's continue talking about the design more it comes with a 10 days warranty in case if like these book goes bad or something but yeah they could give you more or something like that it's just the 10 days warranty after all it is made in india i mean it's kind of obvious right this this tiny thing only weighs 45 grams so means anyone can hold it except for [Music] this is available in two color variants i mean it's not a lot of colors

things in your box don't discard them don't throw them away and now you know exactly what they're used for now the original tip that comes out of the s-pen with the galaxy note 9 out of the box is going to be this white greyish color now this one will basically simulate as if you're using a little pen or a pencil it's gonna be a little bit more fine of a tip it's actually a little bit harder if you actually tap on the screen you will actually hear the tip hitting the screen itself so if you want it to have a little bit more fine of a tip something that simulates pretty much a pen or a pencil it's not gonna be as smooth as the black tip then definitely use this white grey one but you will also notice that over time you might want to exchange this out because I can see mine is already getting a little dirty on the very end it might be not as fine or as new as when I first got this s-pen out of the phone and that is one of the reasons why there is additional replacements now when it comes over to the additional color or the second color it's going to be this black tip now this one's a little bit more smooth this one I can see it working a little bit better with a film color other than a tempered screen so if you have a little plastic film on your screen you might see that this black one will be a little bit better for you it's a little bit more quiet and it feels a little bit more like a stylus so if you want it to kind of be a little bit more smooth then definitely go for the black tip but if you wanted to again simulate or feel like a pen or pencil then go with this white tip now I'm going to show you how you're able to easily pull it out and replace it with either of the different colors so you'd be able to check out that process so simply all you do is just take this little tool you're gonna place it right into the very center of this little gripping tool and as you basically grip it and you pull it out it's gonna come out just like that you place it down and you can either place in the black or white tip depending on how you want it to feel so I'm gonna place it in the black tip so you can kind of see what that looks like so if I move it over it kind of blends in a little bit more I guess there's not much white behind it there we go so this is what it would look like if you want your black tip to be installed on the s-pen especially this yellow s pen which actually looks pretty cool if you wanted to have the black tip versus the white tip so now let me show you that if I go inside of these Samsung notes they're both going to write the exact same so the first one I will show you is with this black tip so this is the one that I mentioned from before that'll be a little bit more smooth a little bit more like a stylus something that's a little bit more quiet but one of the thing is let's say that I just want to write down the word test and then if I wanted to actually press down even harder because of all the different pressure points you can see how this one is more bold it's a darker color and it's not really going to change no matter what the tip you do so if you were trying to find a tip that's a little bit more fine all you would really have to do is go inside of your little tool over here and make it go a little bit more fine than before that's really the only way there's a lot of pressure points inside the phone to pretty much pick everything up now here's the other thing I'm gonna try to actually tap on the screen and we'll see if my mic picks it up so I did hit that pretty hard and now we're gonna go over into this little white or grayish color and you're gonna see that that little tapping is going to be much louder and everything else is gonna look the exact same with how bold and thin all these letters are so now again you'll just take your tool you're going to take it right on out place in your white gray one and I will let you know too that if you do have the note 8 and you're using a or you like to use the tips maybe on your note 9 these are actually the tips that came from the Galaxy Note 8 so these are the exact same ones for the note 8 and for the note 9 so you are able to keep some of these for future use so now let's go over here I'm just gonna lie pretty much write it pretty much kind of soft again and then if I was to you press it down hard you can see that they look pretty much the exact same again these ones are going to be more bold more darker of colors if you do need to change again you're a thinness you are able to just by doing it over there but let's put this right back over here pretty much erase this and then let's draw that in there so you can tell that there's really no difference if you use the white or black in terms of how it looks on your screen but there's a huge difference when it comes on to the sound which you could probably hear that just a little bit louder and also the feel of how it feels on the screen so this right here does kind of simulate a little bit more of what a pencil or pen would feel like but when it comes over to that black one again it's a bit more smooth little bit more soft a little bit more like a stylus so now you guys know that everything inside of that box has a plan and a reason and a purpose so definitely don't throw away this little tool it'll definitely come in handy even if you hold on to these things for a couple different years it'll work with all the different s pens that come out from Samsung and also especially these tips these are definitely useful to hold on to and keep just so if you would like to make your S Pen feel like brand-new again or if your tip happens to break or if you want it to feel different again I will reiterate the white one the gray one right over here is going to be mostly for if you want it to be a little bit finer of a tip little bit harder of a tip something that has a little bit of a resistance like a pen or a pencil this one right over here the black one is gonna be mostly for a more smooth more softer tip even though they both feel pretty hard it just somehow has a softer tip making it feel a little bit more smooth kind of like a stylus so it depends on what feel you would like to use on your Galaxy Note 9 or the Galaxy Note 8 so outside of that hope that you guys have liked this video hopefully there's something that was brand new that you've

going to replace and use or which color tip you if you already knew these different things have different purpose let me know which tip you are using right now and which one's your favorite the white or the black and I'll see you guys later [Music]", "n8tm_Lm6SXo": "and I'm gonna go through another stylist review and really this is kind of a just a real quick comparison we're going to compare all the other Silas's to the Raphael 520 this is a brand new stylist has been out for as far as I know just about a week the company the Raphael 5 which I've been promoting has been out for a little while the company sent me the updated version just recently and they were kind enough to send all three colors Wow all three colors so they have the silver the I would call this I don't know what color maroon maroon yeah that's what it is maroon and black so I have all three of these and they have two stylist snips that come in the box so you can see right here one two and so this is goes in like this it has a charging cable here as micro USB and instructions in the back panel alright so I wanted to do a quick kind of run through the features of the Raphael 520 and then also kind of compare it real quickly to the other lines on the other stylist so the very first thing I'm going to do is in Canadian demonstrate what I would consider a bad stylist experience this is the Wacom Bamboo ink and this is the first generation not the new one what I want to point out and what I want you guys to see is line jitter so zoomed in is going to be as nice as it possibly can but you can see there's a lot of wobble right here the second thing we're looking at is the pressure curve can you draw faint lines and can you draw heavy lines our light and dark this is the Rafael 520 the new one and we're going to draw just right next to this one by the way this one has tilt so we're going to need to pick up a little bit and you can see here just the quality of the line is is very different there's much less wobble and let's go ahead and compare this to these surface stylus you can see these lines are almost identical one thing that I do like actually better about the Raphael five is I think the pressure curve I think they did a better job nailing the pressure curve so I'm gonna show you what that looks like so here when we start really soft and then build up too heavy and then we go back down it's actually really important to see that that going back down because sometimes that that is a problem it doesn't quite work so we start off really soft and build back up and go back down now well what I think the surface stylus does wrong is that it doesn't have that low end tapped in by default I'm trying to go as light as possible and I can't get this same really faint line as I can get with the Raphael five so this is called initial activation force and you can see I'm very very light very very light lines in here which is great and this is one of the one of the definitely one of the more important things that artists ask on a frequent basis can you do what's the initial activation force the initial activation force on this is actually quite low I'd say lower than the surface stylus now if we go into I have an app running in the background that shuts off the wind key so let's see we'll go into here this is a very good way to demonstrate a lot of the same things we have to set it on here I always said very low okay all right so we're going to erase and you can see the very light faint lines and the thick ones okay and if you adjust this you it actually will adjust in real time so you can see kind of the difference between those two things I for the surface stylus as a lot of you guys know I keep this at three because I think that the surface Silas at seven does almost it looks almost like the pen so full pressure the entire time there's no fluctuation there so let's go ahead and take a look at this now they just updated this app and it's driving me bonkers you can see drawing as faint as I can and we're still seeing almost a full-strength line and here you can see faint heavy and faint all right so enough about that let's talk about the stylus itself this is a two button stylus the surface Silas has just one button here it's very flush on the side the first version of the Rafael Silas Raphael five is right here and let's take a look at the differences between the two so here you can see the stylus is about a half an inch shorter so compared to the surface stylus right here you can see it's about the same length as a surface stylus - the eraser now some people had asked about the thickness of the stylus whether the Silas is much thinner or thicker than the surface let's see you can see this is difficult to see for sure step the thickness wise the surface stylus is definitely thicker but it's not thicker by much when I'm holding this one and when I'm holding this one I don't think this one feels really thin I think it feels actually very very similar it is lighter than the surface stylus this one feels heavy this one feels just slightly less than a B it's not light but definitely lighter than the surface stylus and I don't have any problem with the weight of this pen or the weight of this pen it is magnetic and it's got a really nice magnetic connection so it doesn't feel lighter chinzy the original one has a heavier connection here and a light connection here is this one is a little a little looser up here at the top and not quite as strong well actually I'm sorry I have it the other way around the magnet stronger connected on one side versus the other like very little magnet down here a strong magnet at the top which may not make too much of a difference this does feel more secure at the bottom and at the top like it's equally connected another difference that I want to point out let's go ahead and readjust this another difference that I want to point out is the wake time so if you're using a surface stylus it is always on here you can see this is a really good place to see the pressure curve and here pressing as light as I possibly can I'm still getting this is as light as I possibly can and it goes immediately to really firm just better variance all right so here to button stylus and when you bring it up from sleep because this one goes to sleep this one stays on all the time which is fine I think this is actually ideal when you turn this one on you have to press the right click button and you'll see that little light just clicked on to say okay your stylus is active cool and this one you can tap either button and then this light is actually already on so let's grab another one black one and we tap it and it goes on right away it's a little faster and it does with either one this one's actually not working correctly right now but so right click I'm sorry eraser and right click so one of the most important things that you guys are going to need if you're taking notes or if you're doing 3d art or anything that has a lot of complexity to the navigation is you're going to want to have two buttons on the side of the pen the eraser button again micro USB charging port this one has a better battery life by the way versus the Rafael v 520 better battery life so here and with this I'd go about a week week and a half with a full charge this one I've charged it once I haven't needed actually to charge it again and it's been I think a week and a half so I really am not sure how much longer it is but it's supposed to be a decent amount and it charges twice as fast as this which is who cares to our charging one our charging to full charge alright so here you have the erasers moved here on the side which is a huge benefit note takers and anyone who wants to use some of the extra functionality of this stylus so I can write hello and erase it without having to do anything else now we had an update recently for tablet Pro which in OneNote allows you to map actually in everything it allows you to map buttons over here to locations so I can actually click here by pressing here so if you have a program that doesn't have a keyboard shortcut that's alright you can now make a keyboard shortcut so we can go ahead and select everything and click delete so having that extra functionality like I said is a huge benefit having the artist pad if you're using notes OneNote or other programs also is a big help but some of the things that you're missing if you're using the surface stylus and you have only one button there are other ways to get around it so it's not the biggest thing so question really do you want to ask yourself is do you need the Bluetooth function this has no Bluetooth function zero none and neither do actually most the different ones that I I tested it also did not have Bluetooth function that's something that tends to be missing in almost all of the aftermarket third-party styluses and I think that's fine actually I almost never used the Bluetooth function and I've toyed around with different ideas of using it to trigger microphone and triggering other different things turning on the artists pads and stuff like that and I find that I really just don't use it very often for pretty much anything so there's other ways to do things without using the Bluetooth so $100 I believe you can find them used on Amazon or at a good price on Amazon 79 this over the weekend for Black Friday has a 30% discount instead of $49 I believe it's 35 which for a two-button magnetic stylus with tilt and that's pretty awesome and it has a fantastic line I mean really nice and clean and very responsive let's see here's another one that does not work correctly so if you're buying one online you make it this type of a experience and you don't want to buy the wrong one and end up spending because I think this one was 40 bucks as well buy one that does something like this so that is the Raphael 522 button stylus it is my favorite one is the actually the only one that I currently use the rest of them just sit around and so my top choice best stylus for the surface the best stylus for surface compatible or Microsoft pen protocol devices aka intrigue alright that's it you guys I put a link in the description I've I'm working actually to become an affiliate directly with Rene sir because I think they make a great product and I try and do things a little bit different than some reviewers do and I've talked about this a couple different times but as far as affiliate things I think that really you can tell the integrity of a person most the time whether they're just doing things for money or whether they actually use these products and are trying to help you find something that they wish they could find which is where I'm at I looked a lot obviously that's been a decent amount of money with different styluses by the way here's the slim stylus a hundred and forty four dollars and it performs the same way as the Rene sir and the surface pen I don't think you could arguably say it's better in any way it's then it's better than the thin category but not quite as comfortable to hold does some things find recharges but honestly the recharging issues is maybe a 5% issue we're not having two buttons for me is like a 70% issue so anyway the the whole thing with affiliates I think that if you find something that you like then as a reviewer you reach out to the company and say hey I'd like to be an affiliate for whatever product this is and you kind of go about it that way like you reach out to them and sometimes it works the other way in that's fine but I know a lot of people are really concerned about promoting products because they're worried that it'll tarnish their reviewing abilities and I just want to say hey it's okay it's alright to promote things that you truly actually like so Raphael 5:20 truly absolutely liked it it's a great stylist and if you have questions please put them in the comment section and I'll be checking those regularly and I have an affiliate link in the description please use that I appreciate it alright guys thank you [Music] [Music]"}
