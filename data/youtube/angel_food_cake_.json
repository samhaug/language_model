{"21o0RbkmBTs": "- Ever dreamt of a cake\nso light and fluffy it's like a cloud of cake\nfloating into your mouth? Say hello to angel food cake. This is delicious. And if you've ever bought it in a store, it's not the same thing. It's a thousand times better\nhomemade and so easy too. Hey, you're watching Preppy\nKitchen where I, John Kannell, teach you to make delicious\nhomemade dishes to share with your family and friends. Today, we're making angel food cake and it's gonna go quick. So let's get started. This light and fluffy cake needs a couple light and fluffy ingredients. So we're not gonna use\nregular granulated sugar and we're not gonna use all-purpose flour. There are workarounds, you can check them out on the blog post. But, we are doing things the right way so, one cup of cake flour, which is 100 grams. It's a little lighter. There we go. Instead of using regular granulated sugar, we're using super fine\nor extra fine sugar. It just has much finer crystals. See this. This is gonna make a difference. If you don't have it, or if it's not available at your market, just go ahead and use the\nregular granulated sugar. But really whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz, whiz it up. Because you want to break them apart. It makes a difference in the meringue. If you don't have a food processor and you don't have it at your local store, use the granulated sugar but\nwe'll talk about that later. All right, so, I want\nto add in 3/4 of a cup. This pulse. Pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse. You'll be here for a few\nminutes, don't worry. So this might seem like\nthe finest of powders but we're actually going to\nsift it a couple of times. An angel food cake is\nthis amazing concoction of meringue with a little\nbit of flour mixed in. Just enough to give it enough structure that changes it from a\nmeringue into a cake. So we don't want to\nweigh that meringue down which is why we're gonna\nbe whizzing and sifting and whizzing and sifting. It might seem like a big\ndeal but it really isn't. It just takes a few minutes. Just a little bit more. This is good, we've sifted it a few times, it's been whizzed a bunch and it's basically a cloud of flour. It might float away with\nsome sugar mixed in. All right, set this aside,\nclean up your work space. Then we have some eggs to\nseparate and we're almost done. It's super fast. So this is Brian's new, favorite cake. He totally forgot about it\nbut I was recipe testing it and he was like munch, munch, munch. Munch, munch, munch. And he's like, \"Oh my\ngosh, this is so good.\" So he's been mentioning it several times, so I was like I have\ngot to make this again. I'm gonna show my friends\non YouTube how to do it. And he's gonna get the whole cake too. One piece for me, the rest for him. Ten egg whites or about a cup and 1/4. And I wanna say about a cup\nand 1/4 because I swear, I go to the market sometimes and there's a tiny, little baby egg and it's labeled extra large. And I'm like, girl, stop lying. I happen to have two egg whites left over from a previous recipe\nI did earlier today, so I'm adding that into the pile. And now what we wanna do is break the eggs into that small bowl. And you can separate the\negg whites however you like. I'm using my clean hands. And the yolks go in one bowl for later and then the egg whites go in there. Until you're done. In case you're wondering,\nthose yolks are amazing to make a French buttercream. Click up here for that. It is like the star of buttercreams\nand it needs egg yolks. So, if you ever make a\nmeringue or whatever else, make some French buttercream. You'll be so happy you did. You could also make pastry cream. Click up here for my pastry cream recipe. Pastry cream is perfect for fruit tarts and filling chocolate eclairs. And you can click up here for\nmy chocolate eclair recipe. There's so many good uses for egg yolks. I'm sorry, okay. I'll just get back to my egg cracking now. Exactly a cup and 1/4. See and that's like the whole egg. It's just there's no rhyme or reason. So just go ahead and\nmeasure the egg whites out. This is gonna go into the stand\nmixer after a quick wash up. Okay, now for the fun part. We're making our meringue. First off, one and 1/4 cups of egg whites. Right into that very clean bowl. And if you have any concerns\nabout your dishwasher at home, one, give them a stern talking to. And two, go ahead and wipe the bowl down with either some lemon juice or vinegar. Just to make sure you\nwant it squeaky clean. Next we add in 1/2 teaspoon of salt. And then, to stabilize the egg whites, we're gonna add in one and 1/4\nteaspoons of cream of tartar. So cream of tartar is a\nby-product of wine making. Delicious. But it's actually an acid. The acid will help stabilize the eggs and give you a nice meringue. And I'm gonna go ahead\nand add in the vanilla, right around now. One teaspoon. A nice vanilla. Makes all the difference. This is the only flavor\nyou're adding to the cake so choose a good one. Start off whisking on low. Go higher. You're gonna wait for this to froth up. Once it gets frothy, we'll\nstart adding in our last 3/4 of a cup of super fine sugar. Look how super fine this is. Wow. The air actually smells sweeter now. (laughs) Okay, so it's frothing up. I'm gonna move it onto high. And your gonna drizzle this\nin a tablespoon at a time. Pretend that, okay,\npause this for a second. Imagine that you have\nall the time in the world to add this sugar in. Because adding it in slowly\nmakes for a better meringue. That's pretty slow. That's slow. Drizzle, drizzle, drizzle. This is a nice time to think\nabout your life choices. Are you happy? Would you like things to be different? Would this cake make them better? It will. Look at that meringue. See how fluffy it is. Pretty crazy. So relaxing, as I actually mesmerizing. Last little bit. Now, I'm not done yet but look at this. Look at this. I wish you could feel how\nthick and crazy that is. It's so strong. It's like marshmallows. And it's very nice and stiff peak. Do you, what? What is this? This is amazing. Just want to like make sure there's nothing hanging out at the bottom. Okay, this is a cloudy dream. It's gonna be kinda\nmessy but bear with me. All right, almost done. Now, we're gonna fold in our flour. So add in about 1/4 cup, sprinkle it in, of the flour sugar mixture. And we're gonna fold it. So when you fold, and I don't have the\nsuperstar folding technique, but all you're doing is\nbringing it from the bottom, cutting through the\nmiddle and swirling it. And I like to move my bowl around. And what you're doing\nis your incorporating the dry ingredients without collapsing all those billions of air\nbubbles that are in there. Or collapsing fewer at least, too. Doing this gives you a\nfluffy, amazing cake. My very most favorite cake,\nGerman chocolate cake, which you can click up here for, is made with an egg white, as well. So you can fold in egg whites for a really fluffy, fine cake. It tastes so good. Ooh, the second you're\nharsh with the batter, everything collapses. You'll be like (crushing sound). It's just like, it gives away instantly. That's why we're swooping\nup and cutting down. Everything's folded in\nand look at this batter. What? It's still very meringue-y. And look those are stiff peaks. That is some good folding technique because you have a\nmeringue, still a stiff peak but you folded in that full cup of flour and the additional sugar. Unlike every single\nother cake in the world, you are not gonna do anything to this pan. It needs to be squeaky clean. Why? Because in order for the\nmeringue to claw its way up and hold its place there, it\nneeds something to hold onto. So you have this, kind\nof, matte finish aluminum. And if you greased it,\nit would just collapse. So you don't want to do that. You're gonna have to cut it out carefully but it has to be clean. It's a special cake. So now we're going to carefully, the cleaner you can do this\nthe less you have to clean the edge later because I\ndon't like having burnt cake on the edge of my pan. Well, that didn't work, so\nlet's just plop this in. So that's totally not cool. We have to smooth all of that out. The kids' are wondering. Your goal right now is to\nget all this batter in here, which is quite resilient mind you, without having huge air bubbles in. Those are not optimal. No one wants to eat an air bubble, you want delicious angel food cake, right? So gently smooth it down. This drives me crazy, I'm\njust gonna clean the edge off. If you've ever baked something and you get those little raggedy pieces on the side of the pan. They burn in and it's not attractive. So it's an optional step but I like to clean the\nside of the pan off. All right, so right now\nI'm just using a skewer and going through here\nand swirling it around. Because I want to break up\nany of the larger air bubbles that are hanging out there. Just make sure the batter is\nall the way at the bottom. Totally worthwhile. Mm. This is gonna go into\nthe oven at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes or until the top is nice and golden brown and springy to the touch in the middle. Out of the oven, super hot. And now it has to cool\nupside down for an hour. The deal is that if you\nlet it cool right side up, it would sink on it, it\nwould just sink a little bit. So you want it to stiffen up a little bit, or firm up after it's out\nof the oven upside down so it's at maximum fluffiness. So I have this on a cooling\nrack just to protect the marble, to be honest, you guys put\nit directly on your counter and this can just hang out someplace. Come to room temperature,\nit'll be about an hour. It's worth it. Once your angel food\ncake is totally cooled, it's time to cut it out. So gently and carefully cut along the side as close to the metal as possible. Do the same for that interior\ntube and then lift it out. Now it's time to cut the\nbottom off, once again, as close to the metal as possible. And then invert it onto\na cake stand, cake plate, whatever you want. This is perfect on its own or with a giant tub of whipped cream. Just like pour the whipped cream on top and it's the perfect vehicle for that. I will just be eating it like this 'cause it's like cake bread. If you like this recipe,\ncheck out my cinnamon rolls. They are delicious and so\namazing in a very different way. But for now it's time for a bite. It's so good. Look at this. Look at that fluff. If you like my videos, hit\nthat like button and subscribe.

I don't even have to floss. (diners chattering) (groans) What? - [Host] Hey, what's up, guys? Welcome back to Binging with Babish, where this week it's Groundhog Day, so we're taking a look\nat the angel food cake disgustingly eaten by\none of my favorite actors in one of my favorite movies\nof all time, \"Groundhog Day.\" To make angel food cake, we need eight or nine\neggs at room temperature. A quick way to bring\nthem to room temperature is to place them in tepid\nwater for about 15 minutes. I say eight or nine eggs because we need 350 grams of egg white, and your mileage may vary depending on the size of your eggs. So we're separating and weighing those out into the bowl of a stand mixer, which we're gonna place\ninto the stand mixer. Add two teaspoons of vanilla extract, and beat on medium-high\nspeed for about 30 seconds until light, frothy, and snotty. Sorry, that's kinda gross, but accurate. Next up, we're combining half\na teaspoon of kosher salt with 360 grams of sugar,\ntiny-whisking to combine, and then very slowly sprinkling\nabout half the mixture into the beating egg whites. Once you got about half of\nthat added, set it aside, and continue to beat the egg\nwhite mixture on high speed until it forms a light,\nfluffy, sticky mass known as a French meringue. We're beating this to\nstiff peaks, that is, when you remove your wire whisk,\na stiff peak should remain. Then we're sifting together\nthe remaining sugar and 125 grams of cake flour\nonto a sheet of parchment. This is going to create a\nvery charming little mountain, which we're gonna dump\ndirectly into our meringue with the assistance of our parchment. And now we have to very,\nvery gently and carefully fold the dry ingredients\ninto the meringue. There's no baking powder or baking soda or other leaveners in angel food cake, so in order to keep the\ncake light and fluffy, we need to not deflate the egg whites that we've so carefully inflated. So once you got the\nmixture nice and smooth, it's time to dump it into a tube pan. We're not greasing with any butter or oil because we need the\ncake batter to stick to and climb the sides of the pan. Get the batter all in\nthere and smooth it out, wipe down the sides of the pan, and place it into a\n350-degree Fahrenheit oven for anywhere from 30 to 40\nminutes, until it's golden brown and looking very much\nlike an angel food cake. Now, one of the quirky\nparts about these cakes is that they have to\nbe cooled upside down. This prevents their delicate interior from collapsing during\nthe cooling process. So we're giving this guy at least two hours standing on its head before even attempting to extract. To do so, we need to run a knife, or a thin cake spatula like\nthis one, around the outside. Because, like I mentioned\nbefore, the cake needs to stick to the side of the pan\nto remain voluminous. Most angel food cake pans\nhave a removable bottom. If yours does not, make sure you line the\nbottom with parchment paper, otherwise you ain't\nnever gonna get it out. Don't worry too much\nabout its rough texture, that's part of an angel food cake's charm. And since the one in the movie clearly had a pink sort\nof whipped cream on it, we get to decorate ours\nand cover up our mistakes. Given that it was pink, I'm going to make a\nraspberry whipped cream. We're starting off with\ntwo cups of heavy cream in a big old bowl, sifting in a half cup, or about 60 grams worth,\nof powdered sugar, adding a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt and a half teaspoon of... (stutters) Oh dear. Well, if I may quote the movie, you can't put that anywhere, pal. Good save. Once we've retrieved our meas cup, we're gonna add one teaspoon\nof raspberry extract. Now to bring that faux\nraspberry pink color, I'm adding pink and red food coloring. Then, using a hand mixer or a stand mixer, or a wire whisk and your\npure upper body strength, we're whipping it to stiff peaks. And we're almost ready to decorate, but I've got one more\nthing I wanna whip up. I've got half a cup of raspberry jam and a tablespoon of water that I'm going to melt over\nlow heat, allow to cool, and then use to glaze\nsome fresh raspberries. Just toss them together a little bit to make sure that they're evenly coated, and you'll have some shiny,\nelegant raspberry jewels to place atop your cakey crown, which we're gonna decorate simply by dumping all the whipped cream on top and spreading it down\nthe sides of the cake. As you can see, my whipped\ncream looks a little rough, and that's 'cause I\ndefinitely overbeat it. But using one of these\nelegant cake patterns around the outside of the cake should make it look a\nlittle more professional. Clean up any rough edges,\nclean up the cake stand, and then it's time to place our berries. To make sure that they're evenly spaced, I like to place one at the top, then one at the bottom, one on each side, and then fill in the spaces\nin between each berry. And that's all there is to it. Make sure you slice with a serrated knife using a sawing motion, as this\ncake is very easy to squish. And as you can see, I definitely didn't let\nit cool long enough, it kinda collapsed a little bit, but it's absolutely delicious. It's simple, light, and tasty. And the best part is,\nyou can fit a whole slice into your mouth at once\nif you try hard enough. I'm kidding, don't try this at home, leave this to me and Bill\nMurray, and other food experts. Hope you guys celebrate by\nwatching \"Groundhog Day,\" maybe making a cake,\nand not eating it in... (groans) - What? - [Host] Hey, what's up, guys? (stutters) This is very, very strange, I'm having the oddest sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, I'm sure that we just did angel food cake from \"Groundhog Day,\" but, um, here we are, so... Let's make us a cake, I guess. We need nine egg whites\nat room temperature. The best way to do this\nis with some water. You know, Bill Murray used his time loop as an opportunity to learn a few things, so I'm gonna try some stuff different. First off, I'm gonna add one teaspoon of cream of\ntartar to our egg whites, this is gonna help give\nus a more stable emulsion. I'm also not gonna beat it as much. Apparently, bringing it\nall the way to stiff peaks can cause your cake to collapse, so I've got some nice soft peaks here. The combination of these two changes should make it easier to\nfold in the dry ingredients without collapsing the egg whites. Next up, my cake definitely had\nsome bubbles on its exterior where the batter didn't meet the pan. So I'm starting by adding\nabout a third of the batter and pressing it firmly\ninto all the corners, followed by the rest of the batter, which I'm gonna smooth out and make sure that the pan is extra clean. This is gonna make getting\nthe cake out of the pan a little easier. Next, I feel like the last\ncake was a little overbaked, so I'm gonna leave it in the\n350-degree Fahrenheit oven for about five minutes less. And as you can see, it's taller,\nit's got a more even top, and I'm poking it rather than patting it. We're still turning it\nupside down to cool it off, but this time I'm letting it\ngo for at least three hours. I wanna make sure that it's totally cool so that it does not collapse. Do my \"surprised hands\"\ngesture that I forgot to do, then pretty much the\nsame procedure from here, we're loosening the sides\nof the cake from the pan, popping it out, and as you can see, much more consistent exterior\nand no concave sides. Then just comes the\nwhipped cream frosting, which I'm only gonna make one tweak to. I'm going to stabilize it using gelatin. I'm gonna slowly dissolve one tablespoon of unflavored gelatin in a quarter cup of ice water. Once that's all dissolved\nand no dry spots remain, we need to melt it in a double boiler, but just until it's melted, not hot. Set that aside to cool off a little bit, and we're making our\nwhipped cream as before, maybe with a little extra food coloring for a more dramatic pink. But just before the whipped\ncream becomes light and fluffy, we're gonna slowly stream\nin our gelatin mixture, continuing to beat until\nwe reach stiff peaks, but taking care not to overbeat. And there you have it,\nstabilized whipped cream, which will keep its shape for days, unlike regular whipped cream which will start to deflate\nafter a couple of hours. We're gonna decorate our cake as before, this time using a different cake pattern because we feel like it. Clean up any rough spots,\nclean up the cake stand, dot with raspberries, and as you can see, it's a pretty noticeable improvement. It's taller, it's fluffier,\nit's smoother, it's pinkier. Just goes to show that\nbaking is truly a science, and that the slightest tweaks\nto ingredients or methodology can produce dramatic results. And \"Groundhog Day,\" at\nits core, was about growing and learning to be a\nbetter version of yourself. And I feel like I've\naccomplished that today. I wonder if this is going\nto be my Bill Murray moment where I finally break free of the... (groans) - What? - [Host] Okay, screw this, it's time to take a page\nout of Phil Connors' book. Wow, they really don't make\nthese things like they used to. I bought this alarm clock specifically because it\nlooked cheap and smashable. Bill Murray did it with his bare hands, and I'm using all my strength and tools, possibly permanently ruining my tabletop. There we go. It's dead. I am free. Happy Groundhog Day, everybody. (upbeat, cheery music)", "b2O3x5xK3Fg": "I'm on a mission to rescue angel food cake from the kind of like a little bit staid grandmotherly dessert that people associate with being too sweet and kind of spongy and really bring it back because I think it's a wonderful dessert with a really special texture and it's such a nice canvas for like any seasonal fruit that you have around so especially for summertime with all the berries and stone fruit I think it's a really nice dessert to try if you have never made it before [Music] [Applause] so angel food cake many people probably had it but I think it's most likely not a recipe a lot of people have made before because it does require a special pan it requires a two pan which is what this is what you want for this recipe is an aluminum to pan like this you do not want to use a nonstick to pan which I don't really know why they make them now angel food cake is a meringue based sponge cake meringue means that it's mixed a mixture of egg whites and sugar so I have one in three-quarter cups egg whites you'll have to crack between like a dozen and 14 large eggs to get this mini egg white so you'll have a ton of yolks left over one important tip is you want to make sure the bowl of your mixer is really clean but there's no fat on it because that is going to make it more difficult to whip a light meringue we'll leave that there for now because first I have to mix together my dry ingredients I have cake flour so cake flour is kind of the ticket here and I'm going to just mix it together with some powdered sugar and the powdered sugar is like nice like stabilizing agent because we want to make sure that the meringue like retains all the air that we're gonna whip into it it's always good to sift cake flour because it can get pretty lumpy and now I'm gonna bring I'm gonna start mixing everything together in the bowl I'm gonna start with my egg whites now before I start whipping this I'm going to add my cream of tartar and it's an acid acids act as a stabilizer for egg whites and a little bit of salt the first thing you want to do when you're beating egg whites is to mix them on low just to kind of break up and liquefy that mass of whites so eventually these egg whites it's going to be a dramatic transformation we went from this like trends you know clear liquid egg whites in the bowl I'm gonna get this into a meringue that's almost at the very top of the bowl so I'm gonna increase the speed a little bit now they're getting nice and foamy and once I start to see some air worked into the wipes I can see this nice white foam I'm gonna start to add my granulated sugar and I want to add this very slowly I want to be able to see the individual Graeme's like cascading into the bowl if I were to add all of this sugar at once they would really overwhelm the meringue and I would not be able to get the kind of volume that I want so you know this is a cake that does not have any chemical leavener it doesn't have baking powder it doesn't have baking soda all of the lightness in this cake comes from the air that I'm whipping into the whites you can see that they have like almost more than quadrupled in volume okay so that's all the sugar now I want to continue to beat this on high until I get to the stage where the egg whites are stiff glossy and make a firm peak so I'm gonna show you exactly what that looks like and now I'm at the stage where the whites are all the way to the very top of the whisk so I want to be careful cuz it's easy to over beat at this stage so at this stage also because the volume of the bowl is so high there's kind of a little bit of a dead zone around the top of the whisk where it doesn't quite get all of that egg white so I want to just kind of mix it a little bit by hand I'm gonna go a little bit further so that is a droopy peak we're close and at this stage it's again very easy to overbeat if I were to beat the egg whites too much they start to have an almost curdled look like they get kind of some texture and then it's very hard to incorporate the dry ingredients so one thing I also like to do when I get a dead zone like this is I'll lift up the whisk a little bit and then you'll see it start to see the marks with a whisk it's when you have that ring of meringue that's not being incorporated into in the bowl that you can easily over be so here we are this is a firm peak sound like a bird beak voici it's a dense foam this is what we want now before I take the bowl out of the mixer I'm gonna add a very small amount of liquid in the form of vanilla extract for flavor and two tablespoons of lemon juice this has a couple of purposes one the lemon juice in the vanilla flavor the lemon juice adds a tiny bit of acidity that I think balances out the what can be a kind of an overwhelming sweetness in the cake so I remove the bowl from the mixer just so I can sift my dry ingredients over top I'm gonna do this in thirds so I'm just sifting this is to eliminate any lumps over the meringue and then I'm gonna let the mixer do the work of like evenly incorporating that the dry ingredients into the meringue but the idea at this point is still to mix it as little as possible yes so I have my oven on 325 once you have all your ingredients together the cake comes together relatively quickly and you do want to get it into the oven if you want to work with someone on a speed because the idea is to not let whites deflate too much that is the last of the dry ingredients I want to take the bowl out and fold everything by hand several times with I have a nice large flexible spatula I'm looking for any pockets of dry ingredients that haven't been incorporated and I just want to make sure everything is homogeneous and well mixed and I'm using this folding technique where you take sort of in large strokes you scrape from the bottom and fold over and that is a gentle way of mixing so that I don't lose a lot of the volume I'm only going to pour about half of the batter in because something that happens with angel food cake is often these the batter is so light you get like weird air pockets I were to go in all at once the batter would kind of fall onto itself and like trap air so then I can use an offset spatula or a spoon and I'm just trying to work the batter around the base of the cake and into those like right angles where the bottom meets the sides both the two of and the outer sides and this is to eliminate air bubbles and I even like to sort of work it up the sides and up the tube and it makes like a little bit of a trough in the center but again this is I found the best way to avoid big air pockets another arrests are the batter and I do pour it all around the pan if you pour all the way onto one side then it's hard to distribute the batter evenly this is a really fun batter to work with now I'm just using that same small offset spatula to smooth it all out and again trying to work it to avoid air pockets and then I want to really try my best to smooth it into a super even level surface okay that looks good I would say that looks good and then I fussed with it for like another several minutes okay into my 325 oven in 35 to 40 I'll check back I'm looking for an even golden color it'll be very pop they'll be a crack in Electra Center or ring and will spring back when I press down in the center so all right the cake is ready to come out and I'm going to show you the best way to cool it down this angel food pan has these little stilts which are designed for cooling the cake so the cake has to be cooled upside down there is so little structure in the cake and it's so light and there's so much air that if I were to cool it upright it would collapse underneath its own weight then it's very tall sides so to cool it down it needs to be upside down if your pan has these little stilts you can just do it this way but another good trick sometimes the pan so sure the older ones don't have these you can use a wine bottle and you just thread the wine bottle neck through the center hole but just like that now the cake will not fall out because we do not grease the sides so it's pretty firmly in there and that's one of the reason why you don't want to use a nonstick pan use this light-colored aluminum to pin because a nonstick pan you risk the whole thing sliding out which is happened to my mom before so this will have to cool for at least two hours like this so you want to be able to touch the sides and have there be no warmth or V coming from the cake so after a couple hours I took the cake off of the buck with a wine bottle and it's just here but beforehand Molden I'm gonna mix together my toppings I have a bunch of berries here I have very beautiful strawberries blackberries and raspberries so I'm gonna let the berries macerated but actually I'm going to do strawberries and blackberries not raspberries because those raspberries don't tend to release a lot of juice and they'll just kind of soften and get mushy I'm just gonna have them because you have to really expose the flesh of the fruit in order for the juices to release and macerating fruit just means mixing it with a little bit of sugar and the sugar draws out the juices and then you kind of get this beautiful syrup that you can drizzle around the cake I always think about my mom's angel food cake that we would have like special occasions and I think that she would just make I think she just likes thaw and sweetened frozen strawberries it's so good just remember it being like the most delicious dessert plus whipped cream now I'm gonna have some of the blackberries as well and these are like to have lengthwise like prettiest that way and I always like to with macerated fruit it's always nice to fold in a little bit of fresh fruit at the end so you have a combination of fruit that's a little bit softer and juicier and then fruit that's super fresh so I'm just gonna toss these with maybe a tablespoon or two of sugar just enough to lightly sweetened their if you're using in season fruit it should already be a little bit sweet you can also do a tiny squeeze of lemon juice which might be nice and that kind of gets everything going but so I'm just let these sit here and hang out and eventually the juices will dry out thank you just do just a little bit lemon and sugar just kind of bring out the flavors of the fruits I mean that you can let this sit for as little as ten minutes as long as a few hours so I have very cold cream here I'm not gonna sweeten the cream because angel food cake is already a fairly sweet dessert the berries are lightly sweetened so I like I always like a desert where there's a contrast between something sweet and not sweet yeah the bowl is chilled a metal bowl works well because it pulls down really quickly you can whip cream in a mixer that's fine the only thing about a mixer is the cream goes from softly whipped to over whip to really quickly so you want to kind of sit there and watch it I have no idea how people whipped meringue by hand I never did that by hand now it's starting to thicken so I can be a bit more vigorous with how I whip it you can see I started to splatter a little bit I also like to sometimes hold the bowl a little lower down because I think I get a better leverage with my arm so you're not stirring cream you're whipping it so the idea is to beat in air so you should hear the whip hitting inside of the bowl that's nicely that's softly whipped so because the pan was ungreased I'm gonna have to cut all the way around in order to get the cake out so I have I like to use a small offset spatula you could use a butter knife that works too or a paring knife pushing all the way down and then doing kind of a sawing motion while I rotate the pan so cutting all the way around will allow me to pull the inner part of the tube out tip it yeah depending on your oven and the heat conduction like I've made this cake where it got much more golden around the top and sides but this is fully baked so as long as your your your end point indicators are done like the tester comes out clean and it's nice and springy then you're done and now I want to cut around the inner ring same way so the final step is to cut around the bottom between the cake and the base of the tube so I'm applying a lot of pressure downward so that I don't end up cutting into the cake and then once you do that the whole thing should lift off relatively easily you can use like two spatulas to lift it off but I think that I can just actually turn the whole thing over a little bit and then turn the whole thing up right everything I like about angel food cake has to do with the texture it's just so pillowy and so cloud-like and it's like a literal sponge for other flavors we're gonna plate so for angel food cake anytime you have something that is very airy and soft and easily compressed it's a good idea to use a serrated knife so you don't end up flattening the whole thing it's just kind of little sawing motions and I like a big piece of angel food cake because I in my head and like it's mostly air angel food cake was definitely a thing in the 90s because it's like fat-free which has nothing to do with why I like it but it was like a thing that we had a lot I think all right so here's a look at the interior it looks so good it's so uniform so like there's a tight structure but it's just so so light that you know there's like almost like weightlessness for the slice so so I would say a cake like this generously feeds eight if nobody wants a second slice so my favorite way to eat angel food cake is the way I ate it growing up which is with whipped cream and berries so this is our really nice softly whipped cream and I like to kind of go right on top of it but actually I'm gonna do berries first so first let me just toss in a few of these raspberries now I go berries first because I want the direct contact with the cake so that it can absorb some of the juices because I cut really do like this it's not really a flat surface you're gonna roll they're gonna roll right off but oh well you kind of dribble the juices down yeah well I'm gonna I'm gonna put whipped cream there so I'll be fine I love I really like this combination of berries and then a super soft really cloud like all of the cream is there some pretty big pieces so I'm gonna ask for some help do you guys have been interested in eating some angel food cake keeps talking you just talk to the camera no well loud you have a hard pass okay sit here and eat the cake by myself it's so good hi maybe this angel food cake with very much Claire [Music] like back in the day in the 90s when sugar was fine and now it's the opposite so thanks a lot yeah that's coming back pushing Oh fat is definitely back yeah there's definitely sugar present but you're not hit with it like it's definitely right you don't need to like drink a glass of water after you knows I destroy Thank You Claire you're welcome take that with I'm gonna take the rest of this with me it's so fun just a cool office isn't it I absolutely think it's worth investing in a two pan just to make angel food cake of course you can do other things in it too but it's such a wonderful relatively easy and quick summer dessert but it really is when made properly a dessert that with a texture unlike anything else so I think it's really special I just think angel food cake is a special dessert it's so light there's really nothing else that quite has this texture and I hope that we can kind of bring it back from like maybe I just think of it as a 90s dessert doesn't anyone else think of it as that but it's really fun to eat and also fun to make so I hope you try it and take advantage of some nice summer fruit scrambling about hop what I like about it but where's my body keeps it keeps for a long time yeah there's nothing to be afraid of sugar something to be afraid of [Music]", "j4ZKatTwp2U": "I'll start with the basics and angel food cake just light and air now for the angel food cake I start with 8 egg whites my eggs are at room temperature and that is an important element when it comes to making anything with whipped egg whites because a room-temperature egg white whip to a fuller volume than one right out of the fridge I want to add a little cream of tartar half a teaspoon cream of tartar is an acid but in a powdered form is quite concentrated it's that acidity that actually allows the egg whites to stretch to a fuller volume it gives them flexibility just a touch of salt but the salt balances the sweetness and I'll start by mixing this with the whip attachment you can use electric beaters but on a lower speed just until it's foamy while I get my half a cup of icing sugar sifted and ready to add [Applause] when you see that your egg whites are foamy and frothy and they're starting to lose that off-white color then you know it's time to icing sugar now what I'm looking for here is a medium peak and that is when your egg whites just have a half curl when you lift the beaters what that does as a medium peak it still allows room for those egg whites to expand and the heat of the oven is going to do that and now I need to sift the dry ingredients a full cup of cake and pastry flour a cup of regular granulated sugar in addition to that icing sugar I added but sugar in a cake lends structure and it makes the cake rise up really tall I'll add a half a teaspoon of vanilla it probably earns its name angel food cake because it is quite virtuous no added fat so the second this right over the bowl another reason angel food cake deserves its name is it is quite angelically simple you've got these simple combination of ingredients but it achieves that chiffon status in that airiness that moisture you never get a crumbly angel food cake the whisk allows me to fold in the flour and sugar without tearing the beautiful air bubbles I worked into the angel food cake the sugar is dissolving as I fold it so it changes the consistency of the batter something characteristic of all chiffon cakes is the pan you bake it in in this case you use a tube pan now the features to note are the straight sides and bottom that way the cake can climb and come out easily you've got the hole in the middle it allows the cake to bake evenly because they heat from the oven gets right through to the center but also some pans are built with little feet on the outside this one has an elevated tube Center because all chiffon cakes have to cool upside down to stretch those egg whites so allows the air to get underneath it another common characteristic about chiffon cakes you never grease the pan and that sounds absolutely ridiculous but you actually want the cake to stick to the sides of the pan as it climbs and Rises with the heat of the oven it needs something to cling on to I just spread it around the to make it as level as you can right off the top I've preheated the oven to 325 because that gentle heat slowly coaxes the egg whites up and gives time for the sugar and the flour to set so it's a nice fluffy light airy cake and it takes about 30 to 35 minutes [Music] all round it's been just about 35 minutes you check the doneness of any chiffon cake by just pressing the top when it springs back you know that it's fully cooked you want to flip that cake upside down see this is why we did not grease the pan and you want to cool it upside down fully and completely in the pan then you take it out after the cake has cooled and I have one it's cooled completely so use an offset spatula and I have to loosen it from the sides of the pan or I just run the spatula straight down and to loosen it from the inside too but using a little bamboo skewer just gives it a little space so that when I tap it out it comes out easily so this is the fun part al-fath a beautiful angel food cake I like to serve it with little fresh cream and berries [Music] and look at that beautiful aussie light interior so with the simple technique you really get a handle on the basics behind chiffon cake thanks for watching oh um just an eye on this channel for plenty of delicious recipes and more [Music]", "pzU6-FTrpzs": "today's show is all about angel food cake white angel food cake and a brown sugar angel food cake and you can decorate these cakes very differently you can serve them with a variety of ingredients whatever way you serve your guests your friends your family will love you if you make them an angel food cake [Music] this is the basic angel food cake light and fluffy and very flavorful it's very easy to make we've sift one cup of cake flour i'm gonna sift this first and re-measure just to make sure that i have a cup this is a very fine sieve and i decided for angel food cake i would only use a very fine yeah that's a nice cup of cake flour that goes in here okay into here three quarters of a cup of super fine sugar it can also be called caster sugar this is a half a cup and a quarter of a cup and make sure you sift that and we're gonna sift this mixture four times now we need one and three quarters cups of egg whites and that's basically 14 eggs at room temperature start beating on low and add one tablespoon of warm water this kind of helps break up the albumin a little bit which is the protein found in egg whites as soon as this gets foamy we're going to add a half a teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar this will help keep the mixture dry the cream of tartar and you're going to add two teaspoons of good vanilla extract and when i say good i mean pure and you can see the volume is getting up there this will be a very very high weight egg white mixture and then start adding your the remaining sugar the three quarters of a cup your half just a spoon at a time let it beat in and you want to keep beating the whites until they are glossy shiny and certainly not dry this is a very very easy cake to make and what's nice about it is that it really doesn't have any cholesterol no yolks so see how nice this looks really good you must have a 10 inch tube pan this is what a chew pan looks like and i prefer the spun aluminum and you can tell it's fun you can see the marks in it here those little tiny almost imperceptible marks in the pan help the angel food cake to rise up the size and you do not butter this you're going to put it into a dry untreated pan and i think we're okay here they aren't so beautiful and i'm going to transfer the egg whites to a large bowl it'll make folding in easier i don't remember my mom ever transferring out of her sand mixer she loved that machine i still have the original down in my basement when we got that machine things changed this is pretty exhausting whipping up meringues and whipping up angel food cakes by hand so here is that now you're going to sprinkle your dry ingredients right over the top in six additions a little bit hold and you go to the bottom and around turning your bowl trying to incorporate all those dry ingredients in as short a time as possible so you see it's very easy and look how white it is and so with very little musks and very little fuss we've made the batter for the angel food cake and you're going to get this now into the cake pan i like this one because it has these little feet so that when you invert it it can sit to cool on those little feet gently plop the cake into your pan try to not get any air bubbles in your cake there now using your spatula gently press going all the way around scrape off your excess oh and you can use the point of a sharp knife to cut through the batter just to make sure there are no air bubbles that should prevent the problem preheat your oven to 350 degrees and this goes into the oven for 35 to 40 minutes these mini angel food cakes were made with brown sugar batter it's very good and oh does it go well with hot fudge and espresso ice cream and now i'd like to show you how to make minnie angel food cakes using a brown sugar batter this is a really really good cake and i love these little mini tube pans very cute and this makes eight two cakes so we have one and a quarter cups of cake flour sift it well and then measure because you're gonna again sift this three or four times you don't want lumps like that in your angel food cake and so now measure exactly one and a quarter cups [Music] one and a quarter taking the time to measure appropriately and accurately is very very essential when you're doing baking because really baking is an exact science so there we've sifted it enough be ready now to incorporate into your cake i have one and three quarters cups egg whites in the bowl already that's about 14 large eggs and i want to sift one and a half cups of light brown sugar press your sugar through the strainer don't make this with dark brown sugar it really is too strong a sugar for the angel food cake the light brown is just the right color and the right taste set that aside and start mixing i'm going to put this in pretty much all at once it's already a great color [Music] i bet most of you have never beaten egg whites with brown sugar just like this it's an unusual recipe there and now add one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar you want your egg whites to be stiff and glossy and not overbeaten or dry and you want your egg whites to triple in volume uh so it'll take a little while but have patience it happens i think they're done stiff glossy very nice look at that what a beautiful bowl of brown sugar egg whites that's okay so now just plop this down into your big folding bowl this recipe calls for two or three additions of the dry ingredients but again work quickly fold them in and because these are so small the pans i'm going to use a pastry bag to fill them okay here's our pastry bag it's a nice long one looks like out of 18 inches so you can fit it with a pastry tip plain looks like a half inch or three quarter inch just fit that down into the tip of the bag there fold over the top of your bag if i hadn't folded down the top i'd have this all on the outside of the bag already so it's a good idea to make a collar hold with one hand point and direct with the other you're going to squeeze with this hand here and just go around so easy practical and sensible and see the nice tannish color of the batter very interesting there so now take a little spatula and just smooth the tops like that oh these are so cute okay these better get into that oven these go into the same temperature oven 350 degrees preheated for about 25 minutes and we better check on the first angel food cake we made which looks absolutely gorgeous put it on a tray and now this is very important you must invert the angel food cake pan so that it stands up off the counter this has little feet so i don't need to put it on the bottle but in the olden days when it didn't have feet we would invert this right onto a bottle like this and let it just cool isn't that great don't fall it won't fall either because it's stuck to the edges of that aluminum pan has to stay like this for at least one hour and then i'll show you how to extricate the cake from the pan we have a wonderful coconut cloud cake here not only is it coated with seven-minute frosting and lots of big flakes of fresh coconut but it's also filled with the same mix so the little brown sugars are out of the oven cooled upside down for about an hour here we have the three egg whites already in the bowl and we need one and a quarter cups of sugar and you're going to heat this before you beat it five tablespoons of cold water and one teaspoon of vanilla extract and a fourth of a teaspoon of cream of tartar [Music] now use a whisk stir this up and heat it up over simmering water until it starts to really get some volume and the sugar dissolves so this is light it is fluffy all the sugar is dissolved and it is hot and now you beat this with your electric mixer for guess how long seven minutes i've made this frosting so many times it is one of my favorites and today we're not just putting seven minute frosting on the angel fruit cake we are actually encrusting the seven minutes with freshly grated coconut and i will show you how to prepare the cake off the bottle cake looks very good you take a sharp spatula and go all the way around the outside of your cake and using a very gentle up and down motion and now this should release oh it does isn't that beautiful and release the cake [Music] right onto the center really pretty now use a super slicer or some sort of serrated knife to take off the top inch of your cake kind of room temperature this will work [Music] that's nice just lift this off and we want to cut a little channel in here we're going to get rid of some of the cake just so that we can fill it with that seven minute frosting which is looking very good so cut just a little channel here about one inch deep and one inch wide just take this out with your fingers this gives you the opportunity to test your angel food cake now the icing is done let's check it oh it's very stiff and very beautiful so now add a little bit of this to the channel in your cake boy does that look good so you see seven minute frosting isn't hard spread this filling around spread some coconut on this no this coconut is so good so here we have the cake goes right back on and continue making your cloud take it down the sides and this cake is going to be eaten today seven minute frosting doesn't hold up overnight it's pretty just like this but indeed to make it into that coconut cloud you have to add the coconut sprinkle the coconut all over sort of can pat it into the sides and you'll need anywhere between three and four cups of coconut there you have it coconut cloud angel food cake spectacular and good you can serve your cake with berries and cream or coconut and cream or syrup and cream or ice cream in hot fudge whatever way you serve everyone will be delighted and you will be an angel food hero now continuing with our variations on a theme for the angel food cakes i wanted to show you several ways to serve the angel food cake the brown sugar we're going to serve with espresso ice cream and hot fudge that's a really good combination and the white angel food cake i'm going to serve with whipped cream and elderflower syrup and this is the elderflower syrup right now in my garden we have elder flowers they're going to turn into elderberries all these flowers looks a little bit like gigantic queen anne's lace uh four cups of sugar and i've measured three already four cups of water to make a simple syrup the peel of two lemons and the juice of these two lemons and you cook this together with the heads of 20 elder flowers so bring this to a simmer i'll make sure all the sugar is dissolved now the hot fudge we'll make next a quarter of a cup of dutch processed cocoa a half a cup of sugar a half a cup of light corn syrup i don't use a lot of corn syrup but in this particular case we do need to use the corn syrup to keep the hot fudge sort of malleable it's kind of important so a half a cup of that a quarter of a cup of light cream and a little bit of salt very important in hot fudge big pinch bring this mixture to a boil for three minutes okay so the hot fudge is ready to finish off add some pure vanilla extract just a half a teaspoon and butter to keep that sheen one and a half tablespoons of butter and that will melt right in here and there you have hot fudge so easy so good just like the hot fudge that they make the hot fudge sundaes with see how glistening and really dark and now the syrup is ready to pour over the elder flowers just pour this right into the bowl the fragrance is really amazing now just cover this with a piece of cheesecloth or a cotton dish towel and let's sit at room temperature for three to four days to steep so now i thought i would show you how to plate some of these gorgeous angel food cakes the brown sugar cakes look great they have a lovely crust you could powder sugar them and serve them with a scoop of espresso ice cream i could put it right on top and i think i will and pour a little bit of that really tasty hot fudge right over it that is a spectacular dessert and now for this cake you can cut with a serrated knife like that and plate that you can pour a little bit of your elderflower syrup on it or around it and serve that with a dollop of whipped cream and maybe oh just a fantastic look at that gigantic brandywine berry that is really pretty well you have an array of choices and an array of flavors angel food cake whichever way you serve it is always a delight and always well liked", "lxr3k3b4EnA": "[Music] you [Music]", "5pNdb5J57vs": "hey guys thomas joseph here with another kitchen conundrum people have been saying that they're having trouble with angel food cake either comes out too dense it's wet or when it's cooling it falls well today i'm going to show you a recipe for success and that is angel food cake 101 so to start I have egg whites which is the leavening in angel food cake 1 in 3/4 cups of egg whites here it's a volume measure but that's about 14 large egg whites and they're at room temperature because that's how you'll get maximum volume and to this I'm going to add one tablespoon of room-temperature water the water just kind of helps to break up the egg whites and start this on medium speed and once the egg whites get slightly frothy as they are now at one-and-a-half teaspoons of cream of tartar cream of tartar adds strength to the egg foam so it helps to stabilize 1/2 teaspoon of coarse salt and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract so I'm going to continue beating this on medium speed until I get soft peaks now you want to make sure that you have on hand 3/4 of a cup of superfine sugar superfine sugar is also known as caster sugar the granules are a little bit finer than regular sugar and they dissolve easily in meringues or egg whites just like this so it's been about a few minutes beat this mixture until you reach soft peaks so we're just about there at soft peaks you can see they're tipping over they're not holding a stiff shape and now I'm going to increase the speed to medium-high and I'm going to gradually add my sugar a tablespoon at a time and I'm going to continue beating this until it reaches stiff peaks but the meringue isn't dry so keep an eye on it so our peaks are nice and stiff if you can see it's standing straight up they're still glassy now transfer to a bigger bowl because we have to fold in a little bit more sugar and our cake flour I have in front of me one cup of sifted cake flour meaning that you sift cake flour first then measure one cup and three quarters of a cup of superfine sugar I've sifted that together three times now you want to make sure that you sift a number of times to get out any lumps and make this flour sugar mixture light I'm going to take a portion of this and sift it right over my egg whites you want to do this in additions because it will help in avoiding clumps of flour why are we using cake flour well cake flour has a lower protein content than all-purpose flour which will yield a more tender cake our last addition of our flour sugar mixture folding is the process of bringing up the batter from the bottom up and over incorporating all of the ingredients are kind of moving in a J so this looks well mixed and now I'm going to transfer it into a tube pan this is a classic pan for angel food cake it is aluminum do not buy those nonstick versions because the cake will not rise nicely this anodized aluminum has a slight texture to it which helps that egg white batter hold on and climb up the sides of the pan so evenly spread your batter into the pan this tube pan has a removable bottom and what that does is it makes an easy job of removing the cake when it's baked and cooled and there are some models that are sold with these feet and this is great for cooling the cake and I'll show you how we're going to cool the cake once it's out of the oven so take an offset spatula and spread the batter out into a nice even layer make sure your oven is pre 350 degrees with the rack in the middle of the oven if you have any batter around the edge of the pan just use your finger to remove that so you have one nice even layer and using a paring knife a long thin blade draw the knife through the batter this batter is quite stiff so when you place it in the pan sometimes it doesn't work into all of the nooks and crannies of the pan so this pops any air bubbles and moves the batter into those negative spaces and then right into the oven for about 35 to 40 minutes until it's nice and golden brown on top and slightly springy to the touch so our angel food cake is completely cooled now when it does come out of the oven you need to invert it this is actually a little trick here the cake needs to be cooled upside down so it does not deflate so these little feet help in that if you have a tube pan that doesn't have these feet what you can do is you can take the tube of the pan the center and you can invert it over a bottle like this and let it cool just like that this obviously is completely cooled and I'm going to show you how to remove it from the pan take one of these icing spatulas of something with a thin flexible blade and run this along the interior perimeter of the cake give pressure to the side of the pan and rotate the pan around gliding around the outside of the cake and now fingers crossed you should be able to pull the cake right out of the pan just like this take your spatula again and run it along the very bottom of the pan and for the center section all you need is a paring knife just go around the center tube and you should be able to flip the cake right out of the pan you can use a pastry brush or you can use your hand to knock away any of the crumbs around the outside you know what I can't wait to show you what the inside of this angel food cake looks like it's perfectly tender look at that beautiful cloud-like interior so light and and surprisingly simple to make so there you go you have the recipe and now you can add it to your baking repertoire you", "jKliH3vc6_c": "Hi guys! I'm Laura Vitale. On this episode of 'Laura In The Kitchen'\nI am going to show you how to make Angle Food Cake. It is absolutely delicious; it is relatively\nsimple to make. It is really easy, and I am going to show\nyou exactly how to do it. The first thing you need to do is go over\nthe ingredients so that we can get started. You are going to need some cake flour, egg\nwhites, regular granulated sugar, vanilla extract, almond extract, cream of tartar,\nand salt. Those are your ingredients. Angel Food Cake is great; there is no butter\nin it, there is no oil in it, there is very little flour in it, and it is made with egg\nwhites, so it is kind of 'figure friendly'. There is sugar in it, but you can't win them\nall, can you?! So, before we get started, let me give you\na few pointers on Angel Food Cake, because I do know that a lot of people that have been\ne-mailing me requesting the recipe, have been telling me that they feel intimidated about\nmaking Angel Food Cake. There's a few steps, a few things that you\nneed to know before you start. The first thing you need to do, of course,\nget your oven preheated, but that's like always. But, the key things to this is, if you are\ngoing to make it in a standing mixer, like I am doing it, you want to make sure that\nyour bowl, and your whisk is really, really, clean; there's to be no residue of anything\nin there, because otherwise, the egg whites will not get that beautiful, glossy color. Second thing is you must use cake flour. It's much, much finer than regular all purpose\nflour, giving you that light, soft, airy inside, that makes the Angel Food Cake so special. The second thing is that you need to have\negg whites, and make sure that when you are separating your egg whites that no yolks go\ninto your egg whites; otherwise, they are not going to get nice and stiff peaks, and\nbeautiful like they should. And third thing is you have to have an angel\nfood pan, like so, and it cannot be greased. This is nonstick, you want nonstick, but you\ndo not want to grease it at all. You don't want any grease in this recipe,\nwhatsoever. Okay, now that the oven is preheated, let's\nget started. The first thing we need to do is sift the\nflour. Now, you guys already know that I am not a\nbig fan of sifting, just because it takes time, but this time, you need to sift, and\nyou don't only have to sift once, but you have to sift this three times. You want to make sure that this is lump-free\nand by sifting, it gets nice and airy and just delicious, and gives you that perfect,\nperfect consistency. So all I am going to do is sift this three\ntimes, going from this bowl, to this bowl, to this bowl. See those little lumps there? You don't want any of those. So now I am going to do exactly the same thing,\nand sift it to this bowl. Last time to sift. Perfect. Now, I am going to set this aside. Another really key point to this is that your\negg whites must be at room temperature. Now, it is much easier to separate your eggs\nwhen they are cold, so separate the eggs from the whites and the yolks, put the yolks into\nthe refrigerator. It makes for a fantastic ice cream. You can make custard with it. Don't throw them away. But, keep the egg whites at room temperature\nfor about a half an hour, and now I am just going to put these into my mixer, along with\nthe cream of tartar, and the salt. And, the cream of tartar stabilizes the egg\nwhites, and makes them kind of hold their shape better, so all I am going to do is mix\nthis until it is nice and frothy. Now that my egg whites are nice and frothy,\nI am going to start adding in my sugar, one tablespoon at a time. I am going to add in my vanilla, and my almond\nextract. And now, I am just going to crank the speed\nup to high. That's a little too high. And, let those whip up until the egg whites\nbecome nice and stiff peaks, and glossy. That looks exactly how I want it to look,\nso now I am going to get rid of this, put this in my sink, get my bowl, and now it is\ntime to fold in your cake flour. And, I am going to do this just a third at\na time, and just folding it like so. You don't want to deflate the egg whites;\nthat is why we do this by hand instead of putting it in - instead of doing it with the\nmixer running. That is good, just folded in the last of my\nflour. Now I am just going to put this in my ungreased\ntube pan. Just trying to get this to be as even as you\ncan manage. Make this as level as possible. That looks fabulous. Now you are going to take a butter knife,\nand I just do little swirls, and this just kind of gets the air bubbles out if there\nare any. You don't want air bubbles. So, that looks perfect. It looks like a big cloud; I guess that is\nwhy they call it Angel Food Cake, right? Now this is going to go into your preheated\noven, at 350F, for about forty to forty-five minutes. You will see that the outside is like, light\nbrown, and cracked on top, and I will show you what to do the minute it comes out of\nthe oven. My Angel Food Cake was in the oven for forty\nminutes, and it is exactly how it should look. Now this is extremely important. This cake has to cool upside down. It just has to, otherwise, it is going to\nfall on itself, and become very heavy. And, you want to put the pan on something\nthat is going to hold it upside down, and I use a heat-proof wine bottle. It works every single time; just make sure\nthere is actually liquid in it that holds it nice and steady, and this is going to cool\nlike this, for about an hour-and-a-half, or until it is fully, fully, fully cooled, and\nlike I said, this step is crucial. It has to happen. So, I am just going to set this aside, for\nabout an hour-and-a-half, and then I will show you what it looks like once it is cooled. My Angel Food Cake is completely cooled, so\nnow I can take it off the bottle. Take a knife; I am just going to run it, right\non the edge, the center, as well. Now you just lift it out, and I just take\nmy knife, run it right along the bottom. Dun Dun dah!! Put it on a cake plate! Ah, it's so beautiful! Smells fantastic! I just want to stare at it for just a second,\nbecause it looks so beautiful. Now we are going to go right into it, and\nget a nice slice, but I am going to clean up first. Let's give this a slice. It's so soft. Just cutting it is like - make sure you cut\nit with a serrated knife so that you don't damage it. Look at that, oh, that is beautiful! Ah, take some berries, put that alongside\nfor a good contrast in colors and, of course, taste. I just really want to give this cake a taste. Ah, you can see it is so beautiful and light. It's delicious! Mmmm, it is the softest, most fluffiest cake\nyou will ever put in your mouth. It's so so good.

Bye bye!", "BlGArMV8fLU": "hey sugar geeks lives here today we are going to be making angel food cake the lightest and fluffiest and most Angelica of all the cakes let's go ahead and get started all right so to make our angel food cake the first thing we want to do is sift our flour in our sugar and our cornstarch normally I wouldn't sift but this is one of those cakes that you absolutely have to sift we need to make that flour as light and airy as possible so that it can mix into the meringue very easily without deflating it so you can see all of these little hard lumps in here I'm gonna press those through and then I'm gonna sift it a second time some recipes actually have you sift three or four times but I'm not quite that patient so I'm gonna go with - there is no baking powder in this recipe there's no rising ingredients at all the only thing that gives this its lift is the egg whites so we're gonna whip these up until they're light and fluffy and all the air that we whip into this is what's going to give the angel food cake its lift so it's really important that we keep this flour nice and light the cornstarch is just gonna be another ingredient to keep this cake super light and fluffy and not too dense or eggy there's also no oil there's no butter nothing like that so it's gonna be a little bit drier all right we're going to put this into our metal bowl with the whisk attachment make sure there's no grease in here whatsoever super clean you can even wipe it out with a little white vinegar to just be extra sure and we're gonna mix this to soft but moist peaks these are fresh egg whites but you can use pasteurized egg whites if you also use cream of tartar cream of tartar is basically citrus and it adds some stabilization to the egg whites and just makes it so that they don't collapse once your egg whites look nice and foamy you can go ahead and start sprinkling in the sugar while you're mixing on medium speed [Music] we're shooting for soft peaks so this is still just a little bit watery not quite there it's okay to over mix your egg whites if they're like a little bit firmer but just keep in mind that's gonna cause your cake to shrink so we're shooting for soft but firm peaks so that it doesn't shrink I'm gonna go ahead and bump the speed up to medium-high when I see things happening so you can see our our egg whites are getting nice and glossy and pretty but they're still pretty soft so we're not quite there yet [Music] okay we're starting to see some lines developing in the top so this is looking good to me we have nice soft peaks but it see it's still holding its shape in the bowl it's not just kind of like oozing but the peaks are still falling over I went ahead and transferred my meringue to a large glass bowl so that I can easily sift in the flour and fold all right so I'm just gonna use my tiny little sifter here and I'm just gonna sift that in little bits at a time and we're gonna fold and the way that we fold is you take your spatula and you come underneath and you fold it on top you can lift your spatula up to the center we're never smashing or mixing vigorously though and as soon as you can't really see much flour you can add some more in look how white and beautiful that is light and fluffy and gorgeous you see I'm sifting all over the surface trying not to make a big pile of flour right in the middle I'm just doing basically one sweep around the bowl and kind of coming up to the center and then folding it over I sort of keep repeating that same process so you're never really smashing the meringue angel food cake is classified as a type of foam cake you know being made from egg foam it's been around since the 1800s nobody really knows where it first started from but it is it's supposedly started from Pennsylvania it's very popular dessert cake to go with things like ice cream or fruit sauces because I don't want anybody to be surprised when they're like this doesn't taste like anything it's like yeah no it doesn't one thing angel food cake is known for is that it's classified as a healthy cake because it doesn't have any fat in it it still has sugar but not a ton of sugar and it's very light and airy so you can eat a fairly large piece without that many calories all right let's talk pans this is an angel food cake pan also known as a tube pan because of said tube in the middle the tube is there to help take the the heat that would normally just be on the outside in the bottom and bring it up through the center so that it bakes evenly otherwise it would take hours for this to bake and then it wouldn't be so very angelic it would be kind of like dark and crusty and it's not what we want a thing to note this pan should always be ungreased no grease no pan willies no butter no oil no parchment paper nothing because we want the actual batter to to stick to the edges of the pan and that is what keeps it from collapsing in on itself so say it with me no grease no pan release nothing you can get this pan on Amazon or any place that sells any types of cake pans if you're lucky you might find an old-fashioned cake pan that have the nice little feet on the side that holds the cake up for when you flip it over some of them have removable bottoms I'm just pouring this into the pan trying to avoid any big gaps of air spreading it out evenly pretty Oh be sure to drop the handle end of your spatula in there oh man I got up on the edge too that's those try not to all right so once our batter is in there you want to take a knife and we're gonna go like this through the batter to not only smooth it out but to make sure that there's no air pockets left in there and it also smooths everything out all right we're gonna go ahead and bake that angel food cake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes or until the top is nice and golden brown and springs back when you touch it avoid opening the oven for at least 35 minutes to prevent the cake from falling all right so when your angel food cake is nice and golden brown on top we're gonna go ahead and take it out of the oven and we're going to immediately flip it over and put it on to a cooling rack it's really important that we cool angel food cake upside down to keep it from collapsing in on itself once the cake has completely cooled you can remove it by just using a sharp knife or a butter knife or something to just kind of wedge between the edge of the cake and the cake pan and it should slide right out most angel food cake pans the center tube is slightly taller than the outer edge so it's kind of like having feet but not quite as cool again so I've got a couple of cups of fresh strawberries here and I'm just going to take the little tops off and I'm gonna cut these into quarters or you could slice them if you want it's really up to you look how beautiful and red and delicious those are because they are fresh from the field and not from the grocery store you can always see the difference inside the berries so I'm going to slice all these up and then combine them with just a little bit of sugar and lemon juice just to give it some little zesty bite and that sugar is going to turn the juice from the strawberries into its own syrup which is going to soak into that delicious angel food cake and taste amazing and this is called macerating it's just a really easy way to make a delicious dessert because we're not cooking the berries it's going to keep that very fresh ripe strawberry flavor because every time you cook berries it kind of dulls down the flavor a little bit we're gonna let this sit for thirty to forty minutes I'm going to sprinkle a couple tablespoons of sifted powdered sugar on top that just helps keep it moist too adds a little sweetness it looks really pretty and then optional you can add some whipped cream and fresh strawberries so there you have it guys the most lightest fluffiest angelic cake you've ever seen I am super excited to dive into this all those beautiful berries the syrup soaking into the cake I mean who doesn't love that soft juicy that is looks so good sorry my mouth is watering alright here goes and when uh it's very soft super super soft and it's just completely absorbed all of that juice from those super fresh berries absolutely amazing tastes like summer oh one more bite mmm if you liked this video please check out my strawberry macaron video or my fresh strawberry cake i'm liz merrick and i will see you guys next time bye mm hmm you're coming with me", "geEF_vCy65g": "Today on The Stay At Home Chef I'm showing you how to make \nOld Fashioned Angel Food Cake. This Angel Food Cake is light and airy \nand super delicious. It's the perfect angel food cake recipe. To start you'll need to pre-heat your oven \nto 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and then you'll need a tube pan. It kind of looks like a bundt cake \nwhere it has this center hole, but unlike a bundt cake,\nthis has 2 pieces that fit together, and once again it's called a tube pan. You'll need it to make an angel food cake, and you'll need to leave the pan un-greased. You don't want any kind of grease when making \nan angel food cake. Now there's something crazy about making \nangel food cake and that is that after it's done baking \nyou have to flip the pan upside down. So before we start you'll need to find a bottle that's the right size to fit into the center of the tube pan so that you can balance it on top. Now I know that this sounds a little bit crazy, \nbut trust me, and it's a lot easier to figure out what will \nfit into the center before baking then after. Next you'll want to separate out 12 egg whites \ninto a large mixing bowl. You want to let these sit out for 15 to 20 minutes \nso that they can come to room temperature. This will make for a much better cake if you just have a little bit of patience and let them warm up. In the meantime we're gonna sift together \n1 cup of cake flour with 1 1/2 cups -- here I'll get that sifting -- \nwith 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Now a couple of notes here: you'll want to make sure that you use cake flour \nbecause it is much more finely ground and it's cut with a little bit of corn starch \nand it creates a light and airy cake. So don't skip out on this. And I actually don't even recommend \nmaking a cake flour substitute. Now a lot of recipes will have you use \nregular granulated sugar but I have you use powdered sugar because it is also cut with a little bit of corn starch and it's much more finely ground, and I feel like the combination of the cake flour and the powdered sugar creates the perfect angel food cake. Now moving back to our egg whites,\n we're gonna add in 1 1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt,\n1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, \nand start whipping this. Now I'm using a hand mixer today \nbut you could also use a stand mixer or if you're feeling really strong and like your arm won't give out you can beat this by hand with a whisk. Once your egg whites start to get all frothy and foamy, start adding in another 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, and I like to add it in about 1 tablespoon or 2 at a time. Now this powdered sugar is in addition to the \npowdered sugar that we sifted in with the cake flour, so don't let that confuse you. There's 3 cups total. Keep on whipping this until you have \nnice stiff peaks that form, like so, where it keeps its shape and the egg whites \nwill have a nice satiny finish to them. You want to make sure that you're whipping your egg whites in either a glass bowl or a metal bowl because they'll whip a lot easier \nthan if you use a plastic bowl. Then we're gonna take our flour mixture and I'm gonna sift about 1/3 of it \nright over the tops of the egg whites. Then we're gonna take a large rubber spatula \nand start gently folding this in, and you want to be gentle as you fold because \nyou want the air to stay in those egg whites. You want to repeat this process of sifting and folding \nin the flour mixture until it's all mixed in. Sifting it again it gives it a second sift \nwhich makes your cake even lighter and fluffier. Make sure you scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to make sure there's no hidden pockets of flour. Then we're gonna take this mixture \nand transfer it into our tube pan. I just kind of dollop it in there and \ndivide it around the circle as evenly as possible. It's always a little bit difficult to divide it \naround that center hole. Then I just run the rubber spatula around one time \nto pop any air pockets and then smooth out the top just a little bit. Then this is gonna go immediately into a \n350 degree oven for 45 minutes. The top of the cake should be browned and be dry to the touch and if you tap on it it shouldn't jiggle. Then you'll want to grab that bottle \nbecause you're gonna need to flip it right on top, and I know it's a little bit crazy, but you just leave it upside down like this \nfor about 1 1/2 hours to let it cool. You do this so that the cake doesn't collapse on itself. It just hangs upside down and it doesn't fall out of the pan and you just let it hang there for an hour and a half. I know it's crazy! After the cake is completely cooled we'll use a butter knife to saw around the edges to get it out. Release that center portion too and\nwe'll be able to pull it out. Then you also have to release the bottom portion. Then you can flip it and it should come right out \nand place it on to a cake stand and that's it! Perfect Angel Food Cake! Don't ever let angel food cake intimidate you ever again because I truly believe this is a recipe \nthat anyone can make. All that's left to do is use a serrated knife \nto slice and serve.

Angel food cake is light and airy, made mostly from egg whites and sugar. It's important to follow\nthis recipe closely as the taste and texture highly rely on the particular ingredients\nand mixing methods. Angel food cake doesn't\nreally need any garnish but it tastes fantastic with fresh berries and whipped cream. You only need six ingredients total and you can find this full recipe on my blog, sallysbakingaddiction.com. The first step is to pulse\nregular granulated sugar into super fine sugar\nusing a food processor. Regular granulated sugar\nis simply too coarse. We want a very, very fine sugar for this delicate cake. (upbeat music) Set one cup of the super fine sugar aside. Then add the cake flour and\nsalt to the food processor and pulse a few times to\naerate the dry ingredients. Do not use all-purpose\nflour in this recipe. The cake will end up tasting like bread. Now let's whip egg whites\nand cream of tartar together. Cream of tartar is very\nimportant in this recipe. It holds all of the trapped air in place so the cake does not deflate\nas it bakes in the oven. After whipping a bit, slowly add the super fine\nsugar that you set aside. Whip everything until soft peaks form and then add some vanilla extract. You'll have a lot of egg yolks left over so I recommend making a\ncouple batches of lemon curd. Now let's slowly sift and\nmix in our dry ingredients. You'll notice that\nthere's no baking powder or baking soda in this cake recipe. All of the cake's rise comes\nfrom the whipped egg whites. Spread the batter into\nan ungreased tube pan then bake at 325 degrees Fahrenheit until a toothpick inserted in\nthe center comes out clean. Cool the cake upside down. Once completely cool, run a thin knife around the edges to release the cake. Garnish if desired, and\nenjoy a slice of heaven. (upbeat music) Thank you so much for watching.

food cake first you need to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit that's 180 degrees Celsius and then to make this the angel food cake we need a 10-inch tube pan 25 centimeter like this step then some two pieces and we're not going to grease this so just put it together like that and then to start we need to have 1 1 and a quarter cups of sifted cake flour which is 125 grams and we need 3/4 of a cup of granulated white sugar it's 150 grams and I'm just going to sift the flour again with the sugar if you don't have one of these sifters like this you could just use a metal strainer like this just make sure it has large enough holes that the sugar can go through so I'm just going to sift this together so put that aside and then to beat the egg whites an angel food cake is really just whipped meringue you may have to make sure that your bowl and your whisk attachment is clean free of grease and dry and then you also we're going to use one and a half cups that's 360 milliliters of egg whites now make sure they're at room temperature so that they will beat to their full volume so I'm just going to put that into the bowl and then what we're going to do is I'm just going to beat this on low to medium low speed until they start to foam up a little okay starting to foam so we're going to add a half a teaspoon of salt I like to use the kosher salt and 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and one teaspoon of cream of tartar now I know some people have a hard time finding the cream of tartar if you can just leave it out because the cream of tartar is used to stabilize the egg whites and help them whip but since we also have salt which also does the same thing so if you can't find it it will be fine now I'm going to beat this on medium speed until we get soft peaks they were not quite there it's just starting to just see this it's just starting to peak it's just a few more minutes this takes a while okay as you can see just starting to peak that's good so now what we're going to do is gradually add 3/4 of a cup of granulated white sugar that's 150 grams and we're going to do this gradually just one tablespoon at a time and that way the sugar has time to dissolve into the egg whites before we add another tablespoon that way the ring we don't want a gritty meringue so doing it gradually will help that and what we're going to do is beat this until it's the peaks are stiff but still shiny and glossy so I'm going to turn the speed up a little higher medium high and start adding the sugar you can see this is really whipped up nice now while the you can see there's stiff peaks nice and shiny but the test to see if your meringue is done is just to take a little and rub it between your fingers and it feels still a little gritty which means all the sugar has not dissolved totally into the whites so I'm just going to beat it a minute or two longer to make sure that's completely dissolved yeah that's really nice and smooth between my fingers so now we're going to flavor this and I'm going to flavor it with two teaspoons of vanilla extract now try to use a pure because it has a lot better flavor than the imitation and we're just going to add a little almond extract 1/2 teaspoon and again try to use a pure almond extract this is going to add a really nice flavor to this cake and I'm just going to beat this until it's incorporated okay see this is really nice stiff nice and shiny so now normally we hadn't we're now going to sift the flour sugar mixture over the top of this I'm going to just transfer the meringue to a bigger bowl here so you can see what I'm doing normally I would just do it over the top here but see this is really nice now for those watching your fat content this is a perfect cake no butter or oil or spring sugar and flour and some flavoring it makes a nice large cake everyone can have a large large slice okay so there's our meringue now you can use just your rubber spatula or if you want to use a wire whisk what we're going to do is sift over top and like about a quarter of the flour sugar mixture at a time because otherwise it's hard to fold it all in at once I'm just going to sift it again over the top and you just want to fold this in just until it's all incorporated not too much because we don't want to deflate the meringue so as best as you can big strokes down through the middle and once that's folded in more like like I said you don't have one of these you just use a wire strainer that's fine you can see you have to have a fairly big voice a lot of meringue here and the last flower sure so as you can see it does deflate a bit but you still get lots of volume okay looks good so now we're just going to this into our hand to pen like I said that we did not grease this and the reason is is as the meringue bakes you want it to be able to cling to the sides of the pan as it rises use a tube pan because the center is like a hole and that allows the hot air to circulate and also helps the center cook and it fur to rise see this is pretty okay so we want to do I'm just going to try to even this out as best as I can and then you can use a knife or just one of these flats spatulas I'm going to run it through a few times that gets rid of all the air bubbles through the meringue and then I'm just going to smooth the top again you don't want any air pockets cake so this is going to take about 40 45 minutes until you'll see it rises a bit and gets a nice brown crust and a toothpick and sort it into the centre in the round here comes out clean so there we go so into the oven our angel food cake is now done as you can see it has a beautiful golden-brown crust if I insert a toothpick into the center it'll come out clean and cracking that it's supposed to be that way so don't worry if yours cracks that is what an angel food cakes supposed to do and so the thing we have to do this is a lot different than most cakes is that we were going to you need a glass like this a flat bottom or a wine bottle or some something like that and we're going to invert it onto the app just put the center funnel and just like that and that will prevent the cake from shrinking as it cools it's all to keep its height so we have to let it cool just like this for an hour and a half two hours and then we'll take it out of the pan so our cake is now cooled so I'm just going to flip it over and because we didn't grease the sides of the pan we're going to have to separate the cake from the cake pan you can use either a sharp knife or a long spat metal spatula like this and just run it all the way around as close to the edge as you can so we can get all that crust okay and hopefully it'll just save separate as you can see some of the cake has clung to the sides of the pan so don't worry about that so now what we got to do is separate it from the bottom and the inside so again you just use a knife or the spatula just run it around the bottom and I think I'll use a sharp knife because you want something with a sin blade it around now some people like to serve it this way but I prefer it this way right side up there we go so either use like a sharp edged knife or a serrated knife to cut and this is very nice on its own or you could serve it with fresh fruits and softly whipped cream or fruit sauces chocolate sauce or even frozen ice cream or yogurt something like that so until next time I'm Stephanie Jaworski enjoy baking calm", "Wxdj970RM7M": "From Maine lobster rolls to New York pizza, here is each state's favorite food.

Bake in the pre-heated 160\u00b0C oven for 25 minutes Once it's come out of the oven, tap the pan on the floor to remove steam Separate the cake from the pan right away When the cake is completely cool, you can store it in an airtight container and keep it in the freezer Cut the genoise Trim the bottom as the texture isn't as good Adjust to the desired height", "eqNDq193iEU": "( Eggwhite ) ( Sugar ) ( High-quality rice flour ) ( Milk ) ( Lemon juice ) ( Bread mold ) ( Wood frame:used to make the outside of the bread unburned ) ( Bake in the oven )", "fzrhYNPCXtY": "[Music] hi I'm Stephanie Jaworski of joy baking calm today we're going to make an angel food cake also known as an angel cake and this is what it looks like as you can see it's a ring shaped cake it's a beautiful golden-brown crust inside it's snowy white it is soft its spongy but yet light and airy and it's very moist and it's flavored with some vanilla and almond extract and it's nice and sweet so the first thing that you will need to do is to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit which is 180 degrees Celsius and then this is we're going to use a 2 piece 10-inch tube pan that's 25 centimeters now you want to use a regular tube pan not one of those nonstick ones and as you can see just put that right in there that's it and we don't grease the pan we don't know a lat anything you just want to leave it plain because as the cake bakes we want the batter to cling to the sides of the pan and we'll I'll tell you why later but so that's our pan now to make your battery if you have stomachs or like I have here use your whisk attachment or you can use a hand mixer for this so an angel food cake is a foam cake and very few ingredients we have egg whites we have sugar flour and then our flavoring really that is it there's no egg yolks there's no like we don't have any butter or oil so no fat and there's no baking powder or baking soda all the leavening comes from the air whipped into our egg whites so for obviously you need egg whites so you will need one and a half cups which is 360 milliliters or grams of egg whites you want your egg whites at room temperature now for this amount one and a half cups you will need about a dozen eggs so lots of eggs and I'm just gonna show you one how to separate your eggs how I do it you want clean hands and you want to use its I find it much easier to separate my eggs when they're still cold so what I do is I break my egg into One Bowl and then as I said clean hands I just go and pick up my egg yolk and go back and forth until get all the weight off and then I put it in a separate bowl if you're going to then break the another egg I would use another bowl and then so you're gonna do that for probably 12 the big thing is what do you do with the egg yolks cuz you're gonna have 12 well you won't don't want to use them right away so what you can do is once you have all of them take some cold water and just pour it over the top so the egg yolks are covered with the cold water and you can cover and store them in the fridge for up to a week and then when you're about when you want to use them you can just use a slotted spoon or even your hand to drain off the water and I know people say what do you do with egg yolks my favorite thing to do is to make ice cream it's wonderful and a good way to use up all those yolks so that's what our eggs so we're gonna take remember have them at room temperature the reason you don't want to use cold egg whites is they won't whip as full to their full height if they're cold so you want to probably take an hour maybe two hours depending on how cold your kitchen is just put them in there and then I'm gonna add one and a half teaspoons six grams of cream of tartar I add this because it stabilizes the whites and it so that you don't over beat them and then they become dry and you can find cream of tartar on wherever you find all your spice if you can't find like some people say they can't find cream of tartar you could use an equal amount of just lemon juice I'm just gonna take my whisk here let's get in so now what we're gonna do essentially we're going to be making a meringue so I'm going to beat this on medium speed until we have soft peaks so that's going to take probably several minutes [Music] okay so we are done see this just soft peaks it's really soft at this point so now what we are going to do with the mixer running we are going to slowly add 3/4 of a cup which is 150 grams I'm using superfine white sugar and the reason I'm using superfine is it because it dissolves quicker into the egg whites then if you use like granulated white sugar but superfine white sugar is just granulated white sugar that's been processed until it's finely ground you can buy it tends to be quite expensive so what I do is just take granulated white sugar put it in my food processor and then just process it for like a minute and I have superfine white sugar so you could buy it or you just make it now I'm going to add it gradually a tablespoon at a time mix it in that way it'll dissolve quicker and we are going to then keep beating it until it's really thick it's shiny and it holds stiff peaks so I'm just going to put and you want I'm just gonna have it on medium low medium high while I'm adding the sugar and then I'll turn it to high until it gets like thick and floss [Music] okay looks good I don't think I'd want to use any more whites cuz my balls are both full here so I'm just gonna and there so that's what you're looking for nice stiff they're nice and shiny thick beautiful its to me I don't know every time I do this it's amazing you take the whites it's clear liquid and then you end up with this it's just wonderful and you know to make sure any time you make a meringue if you take a little and rub it between your fingers it should feel smooth you don't want to feel the grittiness of the sugar that means it hasn't dissolved if you find that then just beat your meringue a little more yeah now for our flavoring I'm going to add two teaspoons which is 8 grams of pure vanilla extract and I'd like a little almond extract just a half a teaspoon which is 2 grams pure almond extract could you use different or leave out the vanilla add more almond maybe have some lemon extract orange extract yes you could change it up if you want but this is my favorite combo so try it and you might like it so now I'm just gonna beat that in [Music] okay we are done so now essentially we have a meringue but we want a cake so we're gonna add some flour to our meringue now if you're at home you could just do it right in the bowl I'm going to move it into this I prefer a wide like this bowl - when I'm folding in things into a meringue its I find it much easier than this one but if you don't have a bowl like I have then just do it in your mixing bowl less washing up - okay isn't it gorgeous now the trick of course is we don't want to deflate the meringue too much when we fold in our flour because we want a really nice high angel food cake now first I have one cup which is 120 grams of cake flour cake flour is a low gluten flour and it will give our angel food cake a really nice soft and tender crumb I know some people find it hard to find cake flour uh cake flour is not the same as self-rising just so some people get confused it's not the same thing it's just a low gluten flour but you know if you can't find cake flour what you could do is take 1 cup of all-purpose flour take out 2 tablespoons and add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch that'll essentially is cake flour and to my cake flour I'm going to add and now three quarters of a cup 150 grams of that superfine white sugar I'm adding sugar to the flour so it doesn't clump the flour doesn't clump when I I'm going to sift it over the top that's that's why I use half the sugar here and half sugar and I'm also adding 1/2 a teaspoon 2 grams of kosher salt salt just makes everything taste better a little bit of salt so I'm just gonna sip this or whisk it and then now we're not going to sift this over the top in one big like all at once we're gonna do it gradually now if you have one of those hands sifters I don't so I'm just using the strainer maybe about a quarter of our mixture here it's kind of time that's about right and then you could use if you had a large whisk or I just prefer to use my spatula and big strokes we're just gonna fold this in trick is fold it in so it's all mixed but don't deflate too much it is going to deflate a little there's nothing we can do about that okay so once you do that let's fold it in just I'm going to do like four probably and just care do the same thing hey that looks good I'll fold it in so that's an angel fruitcake so now we're going to put it into our pan Hey and then you choose the spoon I'm just gonna kind of into that even it out first and then what I'm gonna do you could just take a knife or I'm using just like a wooden skewer just kind of do circles to get any air pockets out just like that and then I'll just smooth it out or even it out I should say both there now um everyone's oven is a little different I always say that um but it's true I'm gonna say 35 to 40 minutes so what's gonna happen Cakes gonna rise and turn a beautiful golden brown you will get some cracking so don't panic and then you know at about maybe even a little before if you look in and looks done just take a wooden skewer like this and put it like halfway between the center core and the outside should come out clean so 35 to 40 minutes so our angel food cake is done put on a wire rack for a second here so beautiful golden brown there is cracking let it like I said if you push it lightly it'll spring back and of course the skewer inserted into the center here came out clean now most cakes how you would cool it is just like that the problem with the names of food cake if you do that it's gonna sink it as it cools its gonna it will shrink so to prevent that from happening I have a bowl here turned upside down you want a flat surface some angel food cake pans have like little feet so you just turn it upside down this this pan I'll tell you it's really really old I I think I got it one Rick and I got married till a long time ago and they didn't have feet then so what I'm gonna do is just turn it upside down and I'm gonna put the scent this core here on the center of my bowl well I guess so and that's how it cools and that prevents it from like shrinking so now it makes sense why one we didn't use a nonstick pan and - we didn't butter the pan because we want the batter to cling to the pan so that when you turn it upside down if you buttered the pan really well what would happen is if you turn it upside down it's just gonna fall out which we don't want now I will if you do have a nonstick pan maybe you went out and bought one by mistake and of course you don't want to go buy another one what you can do it's not quite as good but just take a wire rack like this have some paper towel down and then just put your pan like right on here and that's about all you can do hopefully it won't wobble too much I haven't quite figured that out but that is both the only other thing because you can suspended because if you people have said of use a nonstick pan their cake is just falling out so that's about the best I can maybe someone else can come up with the brilliant idea so now what we're gonna do is let it cool completely I would say it's gonna take at least an hour and a half maybe two hours and then when we come back we will take the cake out of the pan and try a piece so now to take our angel food cake out of the pan you can either do it straight like this or at home you could do it turn it like that but so you can see what I'm doing I'll do it straight up so you'll need a long sharp knife and then just kind of get it down and then when it's sitting on the bottom you just want to kind of take a little bit of an angle to your knife and then just scrape it along the side of the pan all the way around if your pan Minds just smooth all the way around if you have little feet then they'll be those like notches so then you'll have to take your knife out and then put it down again so I've already done that and then the same in the center just run your knife around and then what we're gonna do is flip it onto our serving plate just press like so I've got most of it if you scrape it along then you can get most of your crust off sometimes you know it doesn't work quite so good and then we're gonna do the same thing around the top all the way around and like so that one didn't work as good I actually like to flip it I like my cake like that but either way whatever you want to do so that what a beautiful looking so it's a nice-looking cake so for the to cut it it's best to cut with the serrated knife I phoned it in like a sawing motion I find that the best because like this is like I've said it's soft it's spongy so I find the serrated knife is the best way I'll cut a big piece here so you can look at that I love the the golden-brown outside crust with that snowy white inside such a pretty cake now um really I'm just gonna cut myself I don't frost this cake I mean you could but I don't actually I just eat it like this the taste and the texture you really don't need anything else it is sweet the texture it's so soft and spongy and it is moist and then you have the vanilla flavor along with a little bit of almond just a hint of almond flavor now sometimes that's just really good I think it's a texture that really get I mean the taste is really nice but the spongy in it's light and airy now eat it on its own or what I often do is like whipped cream whipped cream sorry both whipped cream is really good or fan fresh fruit or fruit sauces like raspberry strawberry lemon curd would be very nice now I like to store this covered in the refrigerator some people leave it at room temperature but if you live in a humid climate like do I find it tends to get the outside crust gets a little sticky if I store it at room temperature so I do is store it in the refrigerator it's good the first day but if you cover it and store it in the fridge quite a few days if it lasts that long so you know especially if you're having a large crowd perfect cake and until next time I'm Stephanie jour ski of joy baking calm [Music] you [Music]", "_34ZmHiSB8M": "by far the most frequently commented recipe was Claire's angel food cake from bone Appetit so I will do this one I'll just save it for next Friday yes we are here welcome back to those of you who have been eagerly awaiting Claire's angel food cake from Bon Appetit two weeks ago now probably little to nobody was eagerly awaiting this I just you know like to make myself think that it's guys I am very excited for this video actually because I feel like angel food cake is not that popular not a lot of people have it that frequently except me because my grandma makes it all the time and I absolutely love when she does as a result so this one is gonna have some pretty strict standards to live up to so let's get right into it oh how I would love to just be able to buy one of these behind the curtains and pretend it's mine unfortunately we cannot do that instead I grab some sugar and heavy cream cream of tarter and vanilla extract take flour powdered sugar some salt and lemon and a whole bunch of eggs as a lot of you with any sort of culinary knowledge can probably guess this is heavily based on egg whites that's the way it becomes so moist and fluffy and airy it's actually quite similar in preparation and components to like a Japanese cheesecake so that'll be an interesting comparison as you can see though we need a whole boatload of egg whites to starts one and three-quarters cup to be precise which ended up being about 13 eggs for me I also wanted to quickly just juice a fresh lemon you need two tablespoons of this which seems like a lot I feel like you're gonna get a pretty intense lemon flavor in the end of this but we shall see I also took quite a bit of time off camera to measure out everything else each one of our components because this is going to come together pretty quickly as we start mixing I started by beating of my egg whites my cream of tartar insults in a very low speed stand mixer to break up those egg whites a bit before turning the speed way up and then slowly streaming in my sugar this actually mixed up fairly quickly I want to say maybe two or three minutes on a medium high speed before I got some nice-looking medium peaks you might be as surprised as I was to find out there's only a cup of flour in this in this entire cake as well as 2/3 of a cup of powdered sugar and those are the only dry ingredients going into this now here is where things inevitably have to get a little bit dicey maybe a little bit controversial depending on how seriously you take your angel food cake in the video and in the recipe Claire very clearly states do not grease this because at the end you're gonna want to flip it over to let it cool and if you grease it a lot it might fall out my concern is that she is using a two-part pen that completely separates and makes it a whole lot easier to remove I don't have that I have a one-piece pen and I fear if I put no grease it just won't come out so here is the plan of attack I'm gonna measure out a strip of parchment paper in a big ring to cover the bottom with a little grease on the bottom end on the actual parchment itself and the tiniest little layer of spray around the sides so that it still will probably stick on the sides at least just not on the very bottom that's the plan in theory anyways I've had a number of plans throughout the years who knows the success rate on them so I continued on I put down half of my batter made sure there was no big air pockets in the middle or around the corners and then just dumped in the rest of the batter and tried to smooth out the top as best as I could I baked this off in a 325 degree oven for about 40 minutes before taking it out and flipping it over immediately on the sake bottle from last week's episode and would you look at that my plan seems to be working and before the whole cake falls out in a few minutes no I was actually very pleasantly surprised by this so all you haters and people wishing this wasn't gonna work on me ha I do want to quickly make a homemade whipped cream just with some heavy whipping cream few teaspoons of granulated sugar and that vanilla extract and once that was looking amazing I threw it off to the side I tried to get myself a perfect little piece of a cake and plate that up with my whipped cream some fresh raspberries I say fresh these are probably like two weeks old and this is looking great so let's try it out it legitimately feels like this plate is empty like I'm holding just a plate that's how light this cake is I'm also fearing that we're gonna have a jiggly Japanese cheesecake situation and it's gonna overwhelmingly taste like an egg white omelet bubble tea I don't know how this works because 80% of this is air and egg whites where you don't taste it at all it's actually got a really nice flavor the inside is super sponge Lee a uniform like there's not many air pockets the crumb is very even I think my favorite part is the outside there's a little bit more texture and kind of more sweetness it's almost like some of the sugars caramelize on the outside of the pan the whipped cream is great too I don't know if powdered sugar versus granulated sugar makes that big of a difference for what it's worth I used granulated I would highly recommend just for something different if you've got the proper pan that's really good I hope you guys enjoyed it today's be a test if you did leave me a big old like on this one if you do not already make sure follow me on Twitter Instagram I'm still away technically so if you want to see what I'm getting up to right now go watch my Instagram story I'm sure there'll be some interesting ones for you other than that of a fantastic weekend I will see you right back here next time peace [Music] and I'm without the egg cooking burgers and my money super lazy try making the tonight baby trying supersize my life for my age yeah I wasn't way before we", "D_mMmCg2QQU": "err tell you say I'll tell you what he blossom ya see pure water any pure liquid for that matter cannot be bubbled the reason is surface tension you see water molecules are so attracted to each other that when faced with an alien environment like air anybody of water will shape itself as who exposes few of its molecules as possible to that environment now the shape that exposes the fewest molecules is of course a sphere okay this is the bubbles geometric doppelganger now to turn water into foam we must break the surface tension and that means adding molecules which can infiltrate the water and get it to relax a little now the list of potential additives is long and as we all remember from Fight Club everyday soap is made from fat treated with a caustic alkaline like why problem is soapy foams like this aren't very stable and they tend to taste like soap so their culinary usefulness is limited to pot scrubbing egg whites foam fabulous because their water already contains the necessary additives in the form of proteins there's so many in fact you can add even more water and still harvest bubbles aplenty give that a try and of course eggs don't taste like silt of course you wouldn't want to drink it right now time to meet the software headlining for Team dry sugar 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar now why so much well here's the thing this cake does not have any fat in it ok and a cake with no fat and a lot of egg whites will end up like only it won't taste nearly as good as that by adding all this sugar we're gonna provide some tenderizing and that's gonna make a nice moist cake now what would really be great is to have fine sugar fine sugar dissolves very quickly and it's nice and light it's easy to work with a light batter thing is who wants to go out and buy fine sugar nobody so make your own two minutes in the food processor since the crystals now take up less space one in three-quarter cups has become one and a quarter to one and a half depending on your food processor now about half of this roughly gets sifted with a quarter teaspoon of salt and one cup of cake flour now what makes cake flour cake flour well it's made from weak or soft wheat which doesn't contain much in the way of protein no protein no gluten no gluten no chewiness cake flour is also very finely milled put these things together and you've got a flour capable of producing a very soft and like hay now when this dry stuff faces the foam to come there won't be much in the way of mixing so it is important that the sugar and flour are integrated and aerated sniff ting now and then again into the batter will do the trick onto the web works a dozen large egg whites whether freshly thawed like these they need to be at room temperature okay cold whites aren't flexible so they don't whip well add to this a third of a cup of warm water now when working with these the most important thing is that there be no fat anywhere inside yes especially egg yolks see a single cc of yolk will drastically damage the whites growth potential why tell you later now get that stuff out of here okay since a drop of yellow could ruin a whole carton of whites do practice safe separation by using three containers begin by separating the white into a customer tea cup in the middle move the yolk into a holding tank then after screaming for yellow flecks move the white out of quarantine and into its own holding tank this way any renegade yolk will be isolated in the middle cup you can throw it away or cook an omelet either way if any yolk does show up in that middle cup you'll have to start with a clean cup to up the flavor ante add a teaspoon of chemical X extract that is any kind you like I think the orange sounds good today there we go last but not least to help the whites on their way to greatness we'll add a teaspoon and a half of cream of tartar now one day when I was a kid I mixed up a few tablespoons of this stuff and put it on my fish sticks I wish somebody had taken the time to explain it this is not freeze-dried tartar sauce but partially neutralized and finely ground version of to tarik acid crystals harvested from the inside of barrels were wines permitted you haven't see them on the underside of corks anyway as a mild acid ooh we'll add just enough hydrogen atoms to the whites to stabilize the phone okay as for the hardware aside from the usual measuring menagerie in various vessels we will employ a large balloon whisk an electric hand mixer a rubber spatula a tube and more on the two-part later and a whipping Bowl you know what let's go bowling simple though they may seem shopping for a bowl is not an easy thing that's because they're actually bowls designed for work and then balls designed to just hold things and I pity the poor fool that confuses the two for instance today that you were to take your egg whites and attempt to whip them up inside this plastic ball okay plastic molecules are very very close to fat polymers as a matter of fact they're so close to one another they attract each other and that means that even after four maybe five hard washings there still will be a layer of fat at least to the inside of this ball and I don't need to tell you what'll happen if a little bit of fat comes in contact with a perfectly good egg phone she's back so why don't we help our good friend W and logically rearrange the whole department perhaps I should rearrange you know you're right most of this stuff is absolutely superfluous I mean come on there are a lot better containers for Dragon slaw to the Halloween hoedown and wouldn't you agree and what about this glass glass bowls you know what they do they break I mean besides maybe not even a jello mold no I think what we've got to do here because is really rethink the role of the work now maybe leave without a struggle a struggle W I got Evan that's bigger than you girl security security since wouldn't you those guys alright you didn't call off the dogs so what are you angling today egg whites actually oh no come on I heard that whole copper egg white thing was just a bunch of my life it's a scientific fact yes absolutely copper ions from the bone mm-hmm that means that those ions very well could block bonding sites on the egg proteins that would prevent other proteins from joining on best preventing / coagulation I like it to do some tapa bulls are also easier to rip in because of the round bottom nothing dislikes them right well what if I was looking for a more everyday kind of bull if you mean Bulls that you can actually work with meet up with him SURS uses double boilers put in the oven and temper chocolate with Jesus moles and horse mixin man you can't go wrong with stainless-steel nesters you can find anywhere from three to six in a set well just Morris better right actually better is better than more and if you're really gonna work them and there are some things you need to look for like well first you would stainless and you want happy that stout notice big shape of the cold the angle of the curve and the narrow bottom makes her easier mixing and straight sides keep the work in the bowl and not on the town doesn't slop out so you can put it in the saucepan and uses a double boiler or you can use it as a lid of course you could just carry it what about that's up to you but I think they get in the way more than they help let's see well I have to say aw once again you have bowled me over you know I'm really all set on stainless steel bowls tasty but hey if you're willing to talk discount on this little copper number here I brought money this time no parity not exactly the copper I had in Mars now regardless of the function of the final film I like to start exomes with a hand whisk it it's better getting the whole viscous mass moving and once you've got it in motion it'll start to build itself into a froth and froth is the first step on the way to a film there look just a couple of seconds got a nice big base of bubbles now it's time to move in with the heavy artillery go with your hand mixer on medium speed you know now would be a really good time to get down inside there and see what's going on here we have a phone just a few thousand bubbles being maintained by little more than the viscosity of the surrounding liquid but as they are agitated by the mixer they're gonna divide and grow into lots of smaller bubbles as the mixer invites even more air to the party more bubbles will be created this is where even a speck of egg yolk can wreak panic by greasing up the bonding points on the proteins that happens by the way now is a good time just sprinkle on some sugar three come on the reserved sugar just the tablespoon at a time it'll take a couple of minutes to work it all the way in now in the meantime the beaters are still breaking up all those big bubbles that's the little bitty bubbles and more and more air is being washed into the next you can help bring them up to the surface every now and then so that they can grab hold of air now you notice that we're starting to get trailing you can see the pattern means that we've got a successful foam going here it's completely okay no it looks good but it's nowhere close to done how can you tell dig in and take a look no backbone no cling not there yet but it'll happen very quickly now that a good bit of air has been incorporated into our foam certain egg proteins begin to unwind and form a mesh around the bubbles now some of these proteins dry and harden when exposed to air rub your hand on a non egg white sometime and then let it dry for a minute and you'll see what I mean as these proteins stiffen so too does our phone sometimes in fact this happens long before the foam has reached its full volume that is not going to happen to us because we added water right at the beginning now we're talking these are called Peaks but as you can tell by gravity's effect there's still slightly soft peaks still we're at a point where good eggs can go bad even with the protection of the cream of tartar and the water so I'm going to turn the speed down on the mixer at this point because if I don't what is now nice and smooth and creamy will become hard and dry and yuck what happened there with it good but don't whip it too long or else the proteins will squeeze together so tight game over and we have achieved medium Peaks now this is as far as I'm willing to take angel food cake remember these bubbles still have to be elastic enough to expand in the oven and we still have some dry ingredients to go in by the way if we'd added another cup of sugar to this and beat it all the way to stiff peaks we'd be talking about meringue but that's another show folding time the goal integrate this dry stuff into this wet stuff while destroying as few of the bubbles as possible now you may remember we put this move on mr. loose in our film noir classic art of the darkness start by sifting on just enough of the flour mixture to dust the top of the foam there now fold straight down with a rubber spatula up the side and over turn the bowl a quarter and repeat working your way around just like that now you've got a nice surface sift on some more the goal do this with the fewest motions possible there it still looks like a bit of a shaggy mess but that's okay you don't want to over fold now it's imperative you get this straight to the pan add the batter in dollops don't really try to pour it in or you'll flatten it out now what's with the tube support this batter is gonna double in volume but only if it's got something to climb to hold on to without a structure here in the middle the cake would just be sink sank sunk the tube also provides for even heat contact and that will ensure even baking now there's several different styles of tube pan but all it's really important is that the center tube comes up beyond the edge of the pan now this one also breaks into two parts which is sweet now once everything's in don't try to smooth it out with your spatula don't bang it up and down or you'll just lose there just give the pan a couple of gentle spins there now straight into a 350 degree oven for 35 minutes no peeking now that it's in the oven this stone will continue to increase in volume that's because the air in each of the bubbles going to expand from the heat now that's okay with this mesh because it's flexible problem is but it gets hot enough this mesh is gonna fall luckily we've already got another one standing by to take its place although human last are the great egg white proteins with this protein in place it doesn't matter if the water and the bubble walls evaporates esteem the foam will remain stable and that is how angel food works that is what angel food cake should look like but to be sure it's done got to give it the skewer right down the middle perfect not bone-dry you don't want it to be completely dry now the problem now is that if we cool this up right the cakes gonna fall because until it really sets it can't even support its own weight that is where the tall tube goes in put a pan on top and gently flip it over now suspended just like that in two or three hours the foam is gonna set and it'll stay that way forever well almost four the one downside to not being able to lube up the pan is that the cake is going to stick but you know if it didn't stick you wouldn't be able to climb up the slides and if it couldn't climb up the sides", "i6rWofcOGNM": "Angel food cake is egg white based,\nso it's light as a cloud.

Using a rubber spatula,\nyou'll need to fold in the powdered sugar-flour\nmixture, one-quarter cup at the time, into the egg white mixture. Keep folding just until the sugar-flour\ndisappears, and you have an even consistency. Gently add the batter into an ungreased\n10 by 4 inch angel food cake pan, or tube pan. Using a knife, or metal spatula,\nto break up any air pockets. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. The cake is finished when the\ncracks feel dry, and springs back when pressed lightly. You should immediately put the cake\nupside down onto a heat proof funnel, or a bottle. Let it sit for 2 hours,\nor until cake is completely cool. Using a knife, or long\nmetal spatula, loosen the sides of the cake from the\npan so you can remove it easily. Spread or drizzle vanilla glaze. Airy, refined, and delicate, angel food cake and be dressed up,\nwith whipped cream, or your favorite fruit.", "_3tP6Eg8Kqc": "the best cake I ever made is this Italian angel food cake I start with some fine granulated sugar I take pinch of salt add it to this what makes this angel food cake so unbelievable is this thank you this vanilla leavening agent is truly a gift from the heavens this right here is why it's the best thing I've ever made what it adds is a nice smooth also it Elevens it a little bit higher than it would otherwise and it becomes even lighter has a great vanilla flavor to it it makes this angel food cake even more angelic if that's possible it just takes it to a different level so we're also gonna add one cup of cake flour to this in a separate container I start with egg whites add one teaspoon of cream of tartar then I'll start mixing this up on a medium speed about halfway to the point when it's really froth up I add some granulated sugar directly to the egg whites very slowly so it doesn't clump I'm also gonna add the water that I have here you need to find the proper balance of those egg whites if they go too far you're gonna ruin it if you don't do it enough it's not gonna be as light and fluffy as it should be you want it to be a little bit softer than a meringue is so I think we're ready a stiff peak I'll stand straight up in the air and not fold over like that this is just a a medium Peaks perfect and then once you get to that point I'll add the flour mixture we'll just sift them directly into the whipped egg whites and I just fold that in with the rubber spatula I want to go nice and slow if I mix it too rapidly it's gonna lose its aeration the key to this is that that beautiful fluffy texture but gently pour this into the bundt pan make sure that it's the same amount all the way around tap it into place and then I'll pop it into a preheated oven for about 30 to 35 minutes piece of cake it's important to get a cake tester it's a long kind of a pin if you will stick a ring in the center of the cake and I pull it out and it's nice and clean that means it's done just run the tip of the knife on the edge of this bundt pan flip it over onto this tray just let it sit until it's nice and cool and I won't remove it from the bundt pan I won't try to take it out while it's warm this is what happens when you can't wait and you don't have patience starts to care a little bit but that's okay I have to be honest I think you don't want anything else with this I mean maybe a cappuccino maybe a cappuccino mousse look at this it just it's like a souffle almost this is just beautiful it's like eating a vanilla cloud this is exactly what I hoped it would be [Music] you", "uZ0vNzLJprc": "welcome back today we are making this layered angel food cake we're gonna start off by preheating our oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and lining three seven inch or 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper be sure not to spray them with any grease you need them to be nice clean and dry for your angel food cake to rise properly next reception together our dry ingredients which include one cup of cake flour one and a quarter cups of powdered sugar and one teaspoon of salt once those have been sifted into a medium bowl we're gonna set it aside and separate hen egg whites normally I'm a fan of using carton egg whites in cake recipes but for a recipe like this you really need fresh egg whites for your cake to turn out properly and super light and fluffy we're gonna add those egg whites into our stand mixer along with two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon of warm water 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cream of tartar and one teaspoon of lemon zest we're gonna mix this for about 1 minute on a low speed just to combine all those ingredients and then we're going to increase the speed to medium-high as this is mixing we're gonna gradually add in 1/2 a cup of granulated sugar and we're gonna continue to mix until soft peaks have formed and the mixture should actually quadruple in volume which seems crazy but you can see it happening right here you want to keep mixing until you've reached soft peaks which should look something like this once you get to this point it's time to slowly fold in our dry ingredients I like to do this with a rubber spatula and I do it in three additions just to make it easier for the flour to incorporate with our fluffy egg whites you want to mix until your flour is incorporated but you want to stop just as soon as that happens because you don't want to deflate this mixture you want all that air to stay in your batter so that your cake layer is baked up super nice and fluffy with that classic angel food cake texture so overall the batter will deflate a tiny bit as you mix it but it should still be really fluffy at the end you know your batter is ready when you can't see any more streaks of flour but it's okay if there are a few small lumps in there the cake layers will still make up just fine at this point you want to divide your batter evenly between your prepared pans remember that they're not greased you can smooth the batter out with the back of your rubber spatula and then pop these into your preheated 325 degree oven for 20 to 25 minutes you also want to let the cake layer is cool fully in their pans before assembling your cake to frost this angel food cake I'm using my favorite stabilized whipped cream frosting which I have a separate video on and you can watch how to make it by clicking the link in the upper right corner so after spreading an even layer of our whipped cream frosting I'm adding a bunch of different fresh berries and you can really use whatever berries are in season or you have near you locally I'm using strawberries raspberries blueberries and blackberries I'm pressing these into our cream cheese frosting and I'm being sure to add a lot around the edges because this cake is actually going to be naked we're not going to be adding any additional frosting to the sides so what you're going to be able to see is just a little bit between the layers so having a lot of berries there makes the cake look even prettier from the sides once all three of my cake layers were stacked it's time to decorate the top and I really want to keep this simple and elegant just because berries themselves are already so beautiful there's not too much extra work you have to do I made a big pile on top of the cake with the same berries and then added a light dusting of powdered sugar to really help them pop and just like that our layered angel food cake is complete this cake is a little bit difficult to cut into so be sure to use a serrated knife to get a nice clean cut thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed this video and hopefully I'll see you guys again soon", "Z9iFIVRGR4s": "if you haven't already hit that like button and subscribe and turn on post notifications so you don't miss any of our future videos guys aloha everybody we are here in the kitchen and we are going to make strawberry angel food cake angel food cake is usually really low fat and really high in sugar we are going to make really delicious angel food cake without any sugar and it is really high in protein so that's really good for you too if you're trying to get your protein gold which you should so i separated this morning 12 yolks and whites i'm going to save the yolks for making lemon curd lemon and strawberry is so delicious and what you're going to do is i should have had this already for us if you don't have a stand mixer it was one of the best things i ever got as a gift um let's see here we go oh of course you are the best present ever you know that but i meant cooking gadget so i like my little shield and i do highly suggest using real eggs when you make this because they just whip way better i'm going to put that on in here make sure that you don't have any yolks in the whites because they won't whip properly make sure that there's no water inside the jar when you put the whites in there no water in the bowl because any water will make the whites not whip like you want them to so i'm going to turn this on and we are going to get messy it might get a little messy here we go okay the whites have been whipping for maybe two minutes i'm gonna add two teaspoons of cream of tartar and that's gonna help stabilize the whites so they don't fall because you really don't want this beautiful cake to fall it's just does that smell good it smells good doesn't it right and then let it keep whipping a little bit um you want the whites to be really really stiff you're not going to over whip them don't be afraid you're over whipping them most people under whip them and then your cake's gonna fall so i'm gonna let that go a little bit longer okay now the whites are really really whipped good and now we're going to add a cup of strawberry egg white protein powder i use egg white protein because whey is dairy and for most people even if you're not allergic to dairy whey is absorbed so quickly into the bloodstream it causes a spike so let's put that in there one cup there we go and you can use a different flavor we're just making a strawberry you could use vanilla you could use chocolate i think they have like a pineapple blueberry blueberry i don't think i have blueberry and then micah can you put a cup of this in there okay okay that one's actually good is it good just plain oh boy we're gonna do a cup of swerves and you could use any kind of erythritol if you wanted to you want me to help you bud that's probably enough let's just do that it's like a half a cup maybe a little more we're improvising i'm going to turn it on just so it starts sifting it i'm going to add a little bit of salt a pinch of salt goes into all desserts because salt is a flavor enhancer you need my help oh yeah keep it and you could use um any type of extract if you have strawberry extract that's great i have strawberry stevia so i'm going to add a little bit of that that's probably enough um just to give it a little bit more strawberry flavoring there we go thanks micah and we're having already tastes like strawberries it does bless you you know what when you say gra grandpa joe if you say bless you to him he says i am isn't cute ah now let's see i wanted to try to open this up but i can't i'm not looking at it properly oh want to turn it down excuse me kai i'm gonna get all of this dough off of the mixer here [Music] here's kai go to town with that and i'm going to use my duck fat spray that i really like and spray um i'm using a springform pan you can use this is traditionally what my mom would make angel food cake in but i'm going to use this and let's see if i have any room left it's going to stick if you don't spray it really well so i'm going to show you this and make sure it's really well stirred and it's going to be pretty stiff here that's pretty good isn't it kai now if you're if you want you could put this into a bread loaf pan because guess what it tastes really good as french toast should we make french toast tomorrow okay yeah mikey want some strawberry french toast sure you're like whatever mom now this is gonna grow so i probably should have used a bigger one but this is real life right this is how it works this is how it's gonna roll this is our angel food cake yeah this is gonna be a disaster but we'll see what happens this is going to go into your oven and it's probably going to take about 40 minutes so we'll check you back later everybody it's gonna grow this is done done and yay it poofs up a bit so just be aware of that um and you can do these in loaf pans because it makes the best french toast and guess what if it does fall it's okay because you can cut it into squares and make a trifle and trifles are super delicious because you get like more frosting than you get cake and that's what i like and so i'm just going to cut into this and if you um have extra if you're lucky enough to have extra it makes really delicious french toast so you cut it into that's why i do the bread loaf pan you cut it into you know slices of french toast dip it in your french toast batter and then fry that up and you use my maple faux maple syrup look at that this is delicious it is just so don't try it because it might be a little bit hot it is a little bit hot i'm surprised i burned my hand so many times it touches about anything but anyway mikey you want to tell them anything hit that like button and subscribe and turn on post notifications so you don't miss any of our future videos it's like it's awesome hello everybody sharing is caring share this video with your friends", "nW8Qe2aJLUw": "i'm about to show you guys how to make my beautiful angel food cake recipe i'm nick and you're watching this grand line where i teach you how to make delicious desserts designed to impress this angel food cake recipe is so perfectly light it has a hint of orange zest in it which is absolutely gorgeous topped with beautifully whipped cream and fresh berries this thing is so easy to make i'm going to show you just how easy right now we're going to begin with the egg whites we want to separate them and let them sit for about 30 minutes so today i'm going to be using my stand mixer if you don't have a stand mixer you can just do this with a hand mixer we want to make sure that our bowl is really really clean this bowl is clean but just in case there are any trace fats in here and i didn't clean it properly we're actually going to be cleaning it with some vinegar so i've just got like regular white vinegar here and i've poured it into my bowl i'm going to use a paper towel and we are going to wipe the inside of our bowl and what this does is it helps the egg whites actually whip up better so this step is really important it takes two seconds so i would recommend doing it so now that we've got that in there we're going to separate our egg whites there are 12 eggs in this recipe it's a lot of eggs but the eggs are what help this cake rise there are no other raisin agents in it so i want to show you how i separate egg whites so i grab two eggs i just gently tap them together and then i kind of play swapsies with the egg yolk so we're kind of just swapping mr egg gurk or mrs egg yolk in between the eggshells being careful not to break that egg goat because you can't have any fat in this egg white otherwise your meringue won't whip up properly so if you're looking for recipes for how to use up your leftover egg yolks there are loads of recipes on like custards and frostings that use egg yolks so you can use them up and there's no waste i should probably also remind you that for this recipe you want to make sure that your eggs are at room temperature not straight out of the fridge just let them fall for about an hour before you start using them in your recipes we're going to set this aside for 30 minutes and i'm going to show you how to get the dry ingredients prepped it's really really easy we are going to be putting some flour i'll add the measurements up on screen for you guys and some sugar into our bowl and i'm going to use a whisk to whisk these ingredients together actually we want to make sure we add our salt in there as well so we're going to whisk these ingredients together so normally i would have sifted these ingredients as i was adding them into the first bowl but it's okay we're just going to have a little bit of extra cleaning to do so sift these ingredients just once because we're going to be sifting them again when we add them to the meringue that we're about to make there's a couple little big bits in here we'll just throw them out i'm going to set that sift aside we're going to set these aside our egg whites have been sitting here for 30 minutes so we're ready to get onto the meringue i've got some cream of tartar here the cream of tartar is gonna help our egg whites whip up better it's kind of like it it's like an acidic thing that's gonna help these whip up better if you don't have cream of tartar you can use fresh lemon juice like a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice or even white vinegar in its place and we're also going to be adding some vanilla extract in here so about like a teaspoon of that so like i said i'm going to be using my stand mixer today because i have it and i already did a workout today so i don't really need to do another workout we're going to be using the balloon whisk attachments for this and we're gonna start whisking on medium speed for about like three minutes until these are nice and frothy and at soft peak stage okay so these are really really nice and frothy it's already pretty much tripled in kind of volume now the way to know if they're at soft peak stage they don't really even hold a peak it just looks really really frothy so that's what you're after now we're going to be adding some sugar to this because that's how you make a meringue but with the sugar you want to add it slowly just to give the sugar and the egg whites time to kind of get to know each other it's more about letting the sugar dissolve before you add the rest of the sugar and doing it this way means that you get a much nicer smoother glossier meringue adding it all at once can kind of cause your meringue to collapse and obviously you don't want that because we need this cake to rise using the meringue so we're going to be adding one teaspoon or one sorry one tablespoon so sprinkle that in there we're gonna go back on medium high speed and continue adding that sugar in there a little bit at a time while the mixer is on [Music] right so this has been whipping for about five minutes it's really nice and thick and glossy and it's holding its shape really really well we are ready to move on to the next step which is adding the dry ingredients so i'm just gonna take this swiss gut give it a gentle tap here to this we're going to be sifting in half of the dry ingredients so that means that we're essentially sifting these dry ingredients twice and that's what you want before we start folding i have an orange here and we're going to be grating or not grating but like zesting this orange all right that's that so we're going to add that in there as well and we are going to fold this in so when i say fold i mean like gently folding and kind of twirling it around on itself as you're folding a mixture like this the flour is going to want to sink to the bottom so you need to be aware of that there's going to be some flour hiding at the bottom of this mixture and once you have finished folding all of the dry ingredients in here it should still essentially be like a stiff meringue consistency if you've done it right there we go all right so i think that's the first half how gorgeous are these flecks of little orange in this cake it's beautiful and you'll actually be able to see them in the cake as well all right so that's the first half of the dry ingredients let's add the second half of the dry ingredients and sift those in as well gently gently folding it can you see how this is basically kept its consistency like it's really thick still like i can move this spatula around and it's not drizzling or dripping off the spatula that's the consistency we want so i am going to set this aside because i have a special cake pan here this is called an angel food cake pan it's really cool because you have like a removable bottom and i'll show you after we finish baking why that's important but this one here also has like these little feet at the top and i'll also show you why these are important when we finish baking so we're going to be adding this a little bit at a time to the bottom of our cake tin we don't want to just pour all of this in at once and i'll show you in a second why so just a couple spatula fools at the bottom now the reason why we're doing this is because we want to make sure that we get the bottom of this cake kind of sorted out before we add the rest of the cake mixture so we're kind of trying to get rid of any air bubbles we are going to spoon the rest of this mixture in and we're just going to use our spoon to kind of flatten this out once you get it nice and flat we're going to be using like a long skewer because this is going to be our insurance policy in making sure that there are no air pockets in our batter so you want to get like right to the sides as well um the inside and the outside and make sure there are no air bubbles or pockets in the cake batter once you've done that we're going to pop this in the oven on 175 degrees celsius for about 30 to 35 minutes and i want to come back and show you exactly what you need to do as soon as it comes out of the oven quickly popping in to remind you guys to hit the like button if you're enjoying this video and make sure you subscribe it's free and hit the little bell icon next to that button so that you get a notification as soon as i've uploaded my next video back to the video our cake has been baking for 30 minutes i've just taken it out of the oven and we want to flip it over as soon as it comes out we want to let it cool down this way because gravity plays a role we don't want the cake to kind of sink down as it's cooling we want it to stay in its shape now the great thing about this is that we've got our little feet so we can let this cool down like this if you don't have the little feet on your pan you can just pop it onto a cooling rack and it'll cool down uh like that but we're gonna let this cool down completely at room temperature don't pop it in the fridge it's just gonna shrink and then i'm gonna come back and show you how to decorate but i should also make a note we didn't actually line this with any baking paper or spray it with any oil because we want the cake to actually stick to the side of the pan because it helps keep that cake shape that we've got with the pan so don't spray this don't line it leave it as it is super easy recipe no fuss we're going to let this cool down for 30 minutes and i'm going to come back and show you how to decorate so i let this cool down upside down and the bottom it's kind of like gone down a little bit but this bit here stops it from completely coming out so it's cooled down upside down i know it's odd but that's the way this cake needs to cool so we're going to carefully go around the side of the tin just in one motion i wouldn't recommend like going up and down or using a serrated knife because you're going to end up with like messy cake sides and we want to do as clean a cut as we can so going around with a sharp knife until you've gone completely around so this is just going to lift out really easily now carefully go around the bottom while we're twisting the cake just one motion we do not want to like go back and forth because we're going to end up with messy cake sides and in this case the bottom here is actually the top of the cake so this is the part you want to get nice and neat so if we turn it upside down there we go we turn it upside down this comes off and we have our beautiful angel food cake i'm going to show you guys how to decorate this it's really really easy simple decorating we're going to whip up some cream and just pop some berries on top to whip the cream i added heavy cream to a large mixing bowl along with a good splash of vanilla extract now i don't like sweetening my cream but if you like yours on the sweeter side you can add a tablespoon of caster sugar or powdered sugar i'm going to use my hand mixer to whip this up to stiff peaks and we're done i just popped my cake on a nice serving plate i really love this cake because it's a really nice mint color and mint is my favorite color so we're going to begin by adding some cream on top of our cake you don't want to go like too close to the edges because as you add the berries it's actually going to push the cream out so we're just going around and kind of adding about a tablespoon of little dollops on top of our cream oh sorry on top of our cake and then the berries guys so the berries i actually washed these and then dried them on a baking tray lined with paper towels just to let them kind of dry at room temperature just so that they're nice and clean before we pop them on so some little raspberries and again you don't have to put the berries on top what is also really nice with this cake is just like raspberry jam or strawberry jeremy cream or you could even keep it even simpler and just add some powdered sugar on top which we're going to be doing i mean it's so simple to make and it's so easy to make as well you could whip this up in an afternoon and then take it to a tea the next day i'm going to slice into this and give it a try fun fact guys i don't actually like berries so i tend to eat a round berries on like pavlovas or anything with berries so i'm just gonna eat the cake then i'll grab a little bit of cream yeah you know what my favorite thing about this cake is those little orange zest things that i can actually see them in the cake and you can taste them they're so delicious this cake was so easy to make i've left the recipe in the description box below for you guys to try it yourselves and if you do tag me on social media if you

they're good but there's just nothing any better than a homemade angel food cake and when you we have so many laying hands because we we raise chickens and our laying hens and we sell a lot of eggs so that means we have a lot of eggs on hand and we eat a lot of eggs so your main ingredient in angel food cake is close to a dozen eggs so I might as well take advantage of that and it's just I love angel food cake it's like you can do so much with angel food cake you can just leave it whole and put some kind of icing on it you can split it in half and put a filling in the middle and then put a glaze on top there's just a lot of things you can don't just eat a plane that's so good but the first thing I'm gonna show y'all and you watch with you what mine's food pen cake pen looks like because it's old I've had it probably I don't know that I've not had it since probably all my married years and it looks rough but it bakes up a good angel okay now you don't want to grease your pan you don't want to grease it you don't want to flour it or nothing you just leave and make a pan just make sure it's good and clean what you can see mines being you so much so it's just it looks pretty wore out and then here I've got 1/2 2/3 cup of egg whites and that's usually about a dozen large eggs give or take a few I think mine ended up being ten eggs because my eggs are some of them were pretty big eggs now one do first is you want to use cake flour and I know a lot of people don't kick cake flour on hand so in my description box below I'm gonna give your recipe or if you if you don't buy cake flour you run out you can make your own so I'll leave that recipe below but I've got it's one I then forgot how much is warning it's one cup plus 2 tablespoons of cake flour and they want you to sift it three times because they want that flour to be really really fine so I took my sifter and that's what I've done I've done it twice but I'm gonna do it one more time and then I'll show you how fine this flower looks it's a cup and 2 tablespoons so I'm gonna get this in my sifter and you know I can remember as a little girl I loved helping my grandmother sister flower because she made everything was from scratch of course and she was always making biscuits or hot rolls or bread or something about every day so I've got my cake flour in here like I said done sifted it twice but I'm gonna do it one more time and you can use this little hand on a subset set but it makes pretty loud noise so I'm just gonna hit the side of my sister or you can shake it like this you see how fine that cake flour is coming out and this is just going to help you make a really light angel food cake and then what this does it gets all the lumps out so you can see it's all out now so I've got my flour in here and right here in this bowl I've got 3/4 cups of sugar granulated sugar and I'm gonna pour that in my flour and I'm just gonna mix that up so that's my flour mixture I'm gonna set that aside now hearing my mixer I'm gonna put in always make sure that your your mixing bowls clean there's nothing in there no kind of a residue or grease or anything like that or anything so I'm gonna put my one or two third cups of egg whites in here now I can't my egg yolks I don't want to get rid of so what I'll do is I'll just fill my container and freeze them because I don't want to waste them so I got my egg whites in here and I need one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar so just want to sprinkle that in there one and a half teaspoons I need a half a teaspoon of salt all I'm going to do is I want to put this on high I'm going to mix it I want to mix it to stiff peaks but you don't want to dry a piece so you I'm gonna try to mix it for one-and-a-half to two minutes and I'll come back and I'll show you how where I'm at and how many Mets it took to get there makes it for just a couple seconds and now I'm going to add a teaspoon of almond extract you know teaspoon of vanilla smells so good okay I'm gonna continue mixing them I mixed my egg whites about two minutes and this is what I'm looking for this right here you see how you can pick your your whisk up and got a stiff peak there so that's what you want you don't want to over mix it but you don't want to under mix it you just don't want to mix it too it's a dry stiff peak okay your next step is gonna be you got another one company you remember we put our flour and 3/4 cup of sugar and we mix them together and that's in that bowl that comes later but you got another cup of sugar and what I'm going to do is it tells you to try to sift your flour to make sure there's no lumps and then of course this is organic raw sugar so it's a little different texture than your granulated so I sifted that now I'm going to turn my mixer and I almost always proud in my one cup of sugar [Laughter] what my egg whites looked like at this point so they're looking good so now it's take my sifted flour in the 3/4 cup that's sugar and I want to fold them by hand I'm gonna put a little bit in there and when you're falling something you take it around then you go through the middle and you kind of bring it up take it around fold it in the middle and bring it up just like that take it around I'll do that and you're gonna do this to get all your flour combine the flour and your sugar mixture you know I giving people recipes for different types and stuff and I'll be even doing a recipe for this angel food cake and I've had people say what does it mean to fold your flour in so you know if you've not had experience with that you don't know what that term means so it's not that big a deal just one cook writing folders all in there because what have happened if you kept your batter on your mixture and try to put your flour in there with your beater going it will deflate your egg whites so that's what you don't want so you just run it around through the middle and just kind of bring it all together you know I know do you think me and that's a that's a lot of work when I could buy a angel food cake and at the store but I'm telling you if you ever like one if you ever make one you'll never buy store long again they're just so good and this is one of my always daughter's favorite cakes she loves a homemade angel food cake and at this point you can smell the almond extract and you know it that's what when you buy angel food cake at the stores that's that smell it's that almond extract and it just you know angel food cake has that distinct smell so I'm just going to keep folding this so I get all incorporate any one make sure it's incorporated good but that's all your ingredients and I'm so blessed to have fresh eggs beautiful eggs mr. Brown makes us some really pretty eggs the way he takes care of and the way feeds them so I'm gonna finish folding this and I don't want to overdo it you just want to incorporate that flour good and then we'll come back and put it in the paint and get it in the oven a 375-degree oven I bet like why it's all folded the flour sugar all folded in some I'm gonna put it in my eye just like man remember we don't put any grease in the pan I'm just don't carefully go around yeah and here's they even as I can it smells so good and you know if you're on a diet of course there's sugar in here flour but it's really you just need a little snack angel food cakes pretty good just try to get as much other as you can okay numbers don't try to even this out a little bit I don't want to hit it on the counter like I do my other cakes get a haircut I don't want to do that it's not even it out a little bit and then I'm gonna take my spatula straight like this and I'm just going to kind of run it around just not running around like this and there we go now I'm gonna put this in a 375-degree oven and it's going to take in your ovens vary so it's probably gonna take anywhere from 30 to 35 minutes and a lot of times I'll sign it and I'll come back to you and say oh it took 20 minutes but we'll see what's the only takes so let's get this in the oven and we'll be back in a little bit oh why my cakes cooking I just wanted to come in here and I wanted to I just want to thank everybody because I have here a little over a thousand subscribers and it just really humbles me so much and you know without y'all the subscribers there would be no channel so we all owe it to y'all the subscribers and not you're not just subscribers but we had become a family we're friends were close and that means a lot to me when y'all like my videos when our sharing when you come back with comments and you say so many kind words it's just sometimes I mean there's been times that's brought me to tears because of the the words were so kind and I really appreciate that but like I said I'm really humbled and I'm really blessed and I just want to thank everybody for your support and I'm going to keep doing this as long as I can I hope someday to retire where I can put you know more content in it but as of right now I do it because I enjoy it and I just I've made so many friends and miss Vicki from

just that's what I'm saying is the YouTube town has brought me to so many very nice people like-minded people and I love that so a big thank you to all of y'all and God bless and I love you all so stay tuned so you found my cake turns out my it's about 35 minutes got it out of the oven it looks good it's not as rice it's what they usually come out and I think well I'm gonna tell you what happened I went over there to turn my timer another five minutes because I had 7:30 at noon it was five minutes and I turned the whole over and off so anyways don't do that I know that's why I didn't rise as good as it should but it still turned out good so 35 minutes it's hot and what you need to do to cool it it's find you something that this whole fits what I do and this is my more subtle masala cooking wine bottle and you just want to stick it over the top and that's how you're gonna let it cool and then after it cools completely we'll take it out and I'll show you what it looks like and like I said I'm going to be making a stew dessert out of this angel food cake and I will make a video on that but it won't come up before Easter this for sure but it's a really good recipe it's easy and it's just as strawberries and Cool Whip and angel food cake and it's got strawberry gelatin in it so it's really easy and good recipe anyways let's list it this cool and then we'll come back and see what it looks like when it's cooled down and plated deck okay our cake is cooled what you're gonna do because your angel food cake panel you'll see how the bottom it's got a place where it's cut out where you can push the middle through we're gonna take a go around the sides kind of loosen up a little bit just kind of fish it out mark it out there just gonna go around them little here smells so good now I might take my knife I think I'm just gonna go around them really had to do that and run it maybe I can do it without missing the top of it sometimes it helps weaken that guy just talking better now there we go so there sure I just okay let's taste it it's not white moist that pretty tasty that's so good you just can't compare oh my angel food cake to storm all it's just so good and this is going to make a really good strawberry snowball cake that I'm making for Easter and like I said I'm going to video that so y'all can see the recipe so I hope you like this recipe and I know if you haven't never made an angel food cake it's it's not it's not hard but you just have to be careful with each step you can't just mix it up like you would a regular cake mix and it all come together I mean you got to make sure your bowl was clean don't have any residue or grease or oil on it and it's getting your your egg whites to the the right consistency of being stiff but not over beat and then folding in your other ingredients so it's worth it it really is and you can freeze angel food cake table so anyways I hope you enjoyed it and I just want to tell everybody to have a great happy Easter cycle when you're traveling enjoy your kids your family your grandbabies and it's supposed to be really pretty here this week and in fact it is right now outside and I can't wait get out my garden I still got a little bit of baking to do but I'm just raring to get back outside so anyways god bless everybody and I'll see you later you you", "HHsnZepNwUw": "A heavenly idea for dessert coming right on Weekend at the Cottage. Welcome to Weekend at the Cottage I'm Nik Manojlovich. I'm about to share one of my favourite dessert recipes. Before I launch into it, a reminder to please visit www.weekendatthecottage.com. When you visit our website please subscribe to it. After that, why not head to our dedicated YouTube channel now with over 300 videos for you to enjoy. Finally look for us on one or more of your favurite social media platforms using #weekendatthecottage on Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. When made properly, it is the stuff of legends. It is airy, light, fluffy almost cloud like. This one and only angel food cake can be yours. Follow my step-by-step guide. It's really fantastic. I'm using a recipe from my mom's recipe box. Actually, her recipe looked pretty good except my mother didn't put a quantity for flour in. Thankfully my sister Maria also had a version of this fantastic cake. Before I get started with the recipe a quick review on some of the things you're going to need to do in advance. You're going to need to pick a tube pan. 10 inch tube pans or what you'd like. You can get them now where the middle part of the tube pan comes away. I kind of like the old traditional solid version. I think they work better and you'll see when I make the cake up perfectly. It comes out of this. A thing I found a couple of years ago is a cake cutter and this multi-prong little do hicky, complete with a bakelite handle that leaves a really lovely kind of way of slicing your angel food. Because it's so moist and and fluffy. This is fantastic. Before we start assembling our cake, we're going to preheat our oven to 375 degrees Rack is in middle position. Now a quick discussion about flour and sugar.   For this cake to work, your flour and icing sugar both need to be sifted in advance. You're going to need one cup of cake flour so I measured out about a cup. Then I sift it and then I have to remeasure it to that cup compliment and remember when you're going to measure we're not scooping this into the sifted flour, instead we're taking a spoon and we're going to transfer. We don't want that flour to compress again. So first thing we need is one cup of sifted cake flour. We also need a cup and a half of sifted icing sugar. Same process, we place about a cup and a half into a sifter. We sift away and then measuring cup to get that cup and a half you're spooning the sugar into a compliment. We then take that flour and sugar that's just been sifted combine them and we sift them again on Maria's recipe card it says to sift twice. I actually did it three times just to be sure and by sifting we're keeping the density level light which is going to be perfect for how this cake turns out we can shift our sifted sugar and flour mixture to the side tongue-twister now we're going to talk about eggs the recipe is calling for one and a half cups of egg white so that's a bit unusual right normally when we work the recipes like you need ten egg whites or any four egg yolks or something like that instead it's a volume measurement of one and a half cups of egg whites we're gonna crack our eggs remove the yolks and then you're starting to build that complement very important if you make a mistake and you get even the tiniest bit of egg yolk in your whites it'll never whip if that happens stop the recipe and go back and start again this needs to be 100% one and a half cups of pure egg whites egg whites are into a large stainless bowl and I like using a large bowl for this recipe because we're going to be folding in a number of ingredients in a moment we're adding one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar a quarter teaspoon of salt hand mixer and we're going to blend those ingredients until your egg white get light and foaming keep blending and now we have a complement of one cup of granulated sugar add a tablespoon at a time and you continue to whip your egg whites in this fashion they're starting to get a nice volume we continue to add that granulated sugar little by little these whipped egg whites are now forming beautiful stiff peaks look at that perfect next thing we need to do is to add some flavor we're adding one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract that's pretty nice but the thing about this cake I most enjoy one teaspoon of pure almond extract add the two extracts and then with a spatula look at how we're folding them into the egg whites now it's time to add our sifted icing sugar flour mixture we have our little sifting basket we're gonna add about two tablespoons and just lightly tap it across the top and gently fold in that flour mixture into your egg whites take your sifter add a little bit more of that flour icing sugar mixture and again just tap lightly across the top I want you to think of this as like you're folding these ingredients into clouds we can't let it sink we've got to go really nice lightly just fold gently back with our sifter and you're gonna continue to do this until all of your ingredients are used it should still be quite light and fluffy now we spoon our cake batter into the tube pan when you're splitting it in push it up nice and close to the sides don't push down just push it till it comes to the center of the tube and to the sides last thing this is very important we're taking a knife and I'm running a knife through the batter of the cake in case there's any little kind of air pockets this will remove them the knife takes them away right you can't hit this pan on the counter like you sometimes do with cakes no we need the volume to be up we're going to transfer to the preheated 375 degree oven we're gonna bake our angel food cake for exactly 35 minutes once it's done you'll take it out of the oven the top is beautifully golden you can feel the density of it very important step have a wire rack on the work surface immediately we invert the pan and now this is such a great concept right the angel food cake is clinging to the pan and it's doing something wonderful with gravity instead of the cake sinking down if we let it cool this way by inverting it the cake is hanging it cools for one hour after that our moment we're going to take our cake run a sharp knife along the inside a sharp knife around the inside of the chimney you have an attractive service piece I invert the pan take a tea towel and just tap the top with a spoon this is that big moment I'm holding the pan and the plate and then with one or two quick boom it releases it comes down on your plate lift away the pan and marvel at your accomplishment I like to decorate an angel through the some sort of beautiful fruit I happen to find these beautiful red currants I thought they were perfect across the top it looks very beautiful I can then take our cutter into the angel food it is coming away without ever this is a very light and airy cake you should have no problem cutting it I think ultimately though you go to enjoy you'll see it's all about I mean the color it's white like a cloud the texture is fantastic you can just grab a tiny bit on your floor one thing you're gonna look at the fragrance of this it is so beautiful oh there is nothing in the world well maybe outside of this robe like an angel food cake this dessert is truly heavenly we hope you make it and after that come on back and visit me at the cottage again we always have something amazing in the works for you to enjoy thanks so much take care", "voP_ueQxUfc": "[Music] fight back to back on a date when words are hard yeah and I didn't stutter ah Bravo Bravo you deserve a treat for that so fantastic you know you're exactly right angel food cake has gotten a reputation in this country for being really difficult to prepare and it's not just from us at home thinking that some of our most famous chefs have put into their cookbooks that this is a difficult thing you should be worried about Oh Craig Claiborne who works for New York Times for decades James Beard our most famous American chef mm-hmm these guys have said in their cookbooks you need to sift your flour 5 to 6 times we need to be very careful with your egg whites they have to be room temperature you should fold the sugar and later they can't be over beaten or under beaten and they make this cake out to be so finicky that I thought it'd be fun to kind of debunk it because truth be told this should be in your back pocket there's no reason you can't make it tonight obviously all right always afraid of this yeah everybody's afraid so if you bunk and I'm I'm here for you I'm here for you put in your back so for the first step you do actually have to sift your flour like Craig Claiborne and James Beard said but you don't have to sift it six times I mean that's insane sift your flour you want to use cake flour because that's actually low gluten and we can make this gluten free so easily we'll get to that in a many times you sift then just once I just sift it once it's 5 ounces of flour sift it once set that aside and then we get to the real star of angel food cake which is your egg whites right most recipes say room-temperature egg whites start beating them add the sugar and slowly mm-hmm too finicky no no we're going to use cold egg whites and we're going to put all the sugar in there at once because that actually gives you a buffer zone for over beating today you don't do that way exactly right you're not going to get the fluffy so I did this at home and I want to show you how much better it works when you use cold egg whites and full sugar let's get that video started this is what it looks like at the beginning now you're going to start it on low I know it looks like it's fast we're speeding this up you're gonna beat it for just about a minute to loosen up those egg whites with the sugar your denaturing the proteins here now it should be it should be a little gelatinous still in the beginning phase then you're going to keep beating what's happening here is you're actually stretching apart those egg proteins and they're pressing against each other and they're trapping air now this second face it should start to look foam but it not have any real body yet now we add the stabilizer and that's lemon juice and kosher salt now you can really let it rip I'm going at about a medium-high here another three minutes okay now it's opaque you can't see through it it's starting to get beautiful last phase beat it for about two to four minutes on the highest speed you've got now this is important most recipes are going to tell you it should be stiff I don't want stiff you see how soft it is and it's almost falling back into itself there here's what here's what happens that cake on the left that one's been beaten with soft egg made with soft egg whites the one on the right with stiff egg whites totally collapsed in the oven Wow you want height I'm telling you the most important thing is do not over beat your egg whites that was so good yeah and so that's actually what I've got here and you can see again this is what I'm talking about with that texture I want something that's going to fall back into itself okay and can almost just it's pudding okay your egg whites should be the texture of pudding and after this all you're gonna do is that the same for meringue would you do this you know this is like this is a specific type of meringue and we there's Italian meringue there's Swiss meringue this French meringue this is a very specific meringue to angel food cake in that you're using cold egg whites and you're beating it with the sugar to begin with and meringue you want stiff yes that's right so now here all we have to do is fold that flour in gently you don't have to be too finicky here and once it's once it's fully incorporated and if you see a little of you know some patches where it's kind of grainy still don't worry just give it a little sizzle now I like to say your egg whites should be almost pourable okay it should be easy to fill this pan Wow without having to scoop it out in yeah it shouldn't have to be totally scooped because this is how you're going to get extreme height when the egg whites are still a little bit soft they're pliant in the oven which means they can still grow they still have room dydt when that air is trapped they still have room to press against each other you can give it a little shake and then flatten it out on top put this in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees and then actually the real secret is I've got the finished one over here oh and it's already falling out and if you caught that it has to cool upside down we're going to use gravity to our advantage here and that's why angel food pans have these little stilts and then you just lift your cake out and you've got I mean you've got the stunning height if you do it this way like God stick around the pan this is very important I'm glad you brought it up look at how sticky it is in here this is exactly what you wanted to cut that out you should never grease or line an angel food pan because those egg whites and that sugar needs something to cling to and climb up okay so never put butter in there", "A9Rvzn7nLqo": "today for our angel food cake we have all of the ingredients here that we'll [Music] [Laughter] need the first thing we're going to do is start beating our egg whites at a low speed so when the egg whites start to get bubbly and froth over you're going to add your cream of tartar and your salt then we're going to turn the mixture up to medium speed so as the mixture just beats and incorporates air we're going to just be sitting here for a few minutes until it gets a little bit thicker we're not going to be doing anything until it reaches about um this consistency and so now we are going to add our sugar and we just do it one tablespoon at a time now we're going to start seeing our batter get thicker and fluffier and that's just what we want when we're almost at the point of soft peaks this is when we're going to go ahead and add our lemon juice vanilla extract and almond extract [Music] so now we're just letting it be just a few more minutes we're really close to it being done here we're going to go ahead and check to see if we have soft peaks it's still a bit runny so we're going to let it beat a little bit more [Music] you can see here that we are super super close it's almost holding its shape but not quite so we're just going to let it be a couple more minutes you really want to be careful you do not want to over beat your egg whites so now we are done if you check the batter it holds its shape it looks kind of like a bird's beak and that's what's called soft peaks so now we are done mixing one of our last steps here is adding that sifted flour and sugar mixture into the batter that we have so you just add it three tablespoons at a time and then you're gonna gently fold this into the batter using a rubber spatula [Music] [Music] so we are almost done the last thing you're seeing me do here is just pour the batter into an ungreased tube pan right now all i'm doing is running the spatula through the batter and the purpose of this is just to pop any air pockets or bubbles that may have formed i'm also just taking a paper towel to clean up the edges of the pan and this is just so none of it gets burnt and so that you're going to be able to bake as much of the batter as [Music] possible this is what the batter should look like and so now all we have to do is put it in a preheated oven at 325 degrees fahrenheit for about 50 minutes all right so it's been 50 minutes now the cake is done you can tell because it is golden on top and now all we have to do is let it cool you do want to invert it upside down and so this is just so the cake does not collapse in on itself because it is so light and airy yes i know i am using one hand towel and one oven it's been about an hour now and so our cake is cool so i'm just gonna run this knife on the outside of the pan and then on the inside of the pan to loosen it up [Music] once you have finished loosening the cake up you just push the bottom out like that then you just run your knife around the top and then you can take the center of the pan out all right guys so this is the final product i really hope you guys enjoyed watching this i do also want to tell you that when you're cutting the cake make sure you use a serrated knife just so you don't crush the texture you", "uaGwoc0N4yA": "hey guys and welcome back to crouton crackerjacks today I'm going to show you how to make angel food cake from scratch a lot of people are intimidated by making angel food cake from scratch don't be it is super super simple because this cake use is absolutely no fat in the batter it is super light super Airy super moist and because of that it is known as the cake of the angels hence the name angel food cake so without further ado let's get started now the first thing I'm going to do is get my dry ingredients sifted together I've got to sit through here over a medium sized bowl and to that I'm going to add one cup of cake flour as well as half a cup of granulated sugar and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt and you just want to sift these ingredients together now I'm using cake flour in this recipe you want to try and use cake flour if you can get a hold of it it just helps create a lighter airier crumb more delicate cake if you will if you can't find it all-purpose flour will work fine and you definitely want to sift this because feel these little lumps that are left over in a sifter if you hadn't sifted this that will end up as lumps in your finished cake and you don't want lumps in your angel food cake so just get those ingredients sifted together and then set that off to the side now because this cake uses absolutely no fat that also means no egg yolks all you use is the white of the egg for this cake so we're going to need to separate some eggs here you want to use room-temperature eggs for this and there's a few different ways that you can separate eggs the first that is most commonly known is to just crack an egg in half and use the two halves of the shell and just kind of gently move the yolk from half to half and the egg white will eventually fall through this is not my preferred method because you can it has a tendency to break the yolks with the shards of the shell but if you don't want to get your fingers dirty this is the way that you would do it the second way that you can do this and the way that I prefer doing it is cracking your egg in half and just dumping the egg into your hand and letting the white run between your fingers just gently move the egg from hand hand and between your fingers the white will come out and you'll be left with the yolk and I'll be gentle here because again you don't want to break yoke another easy way to do this is just crack the egg into a bowl and then just fish the yolk out with your fingers but whatever method you choose to separate your egg you want to do this in a separate Bowl from where your egg whites are stored now you're going to need a total of one and a half cups of egg whites which depending on the Dozen you buy could be anywhere between ten and eleven eggs but you want to separate your white into a separate bowl before you add it the measuring cup because any little speck of yolk that is in your white will impede the foaming process of the egg whites and you don't want any impedence there whatsoever so if you happen to break your yolk just go ahead and get rid of the entire egg start with another egg like I said you're going to need a total of one and a half cups of egg whites and you want to add that to the bowl of a stand mixer you can also just use a regular bowl with a hand mixer or even a whisk if you wanted to but I'm going to turn this on to a lot speed six or so which is just above medium between medium and high or so and we want to start whisking these eggs you want to start getting a foam built up here now once your egg whites have whipped for about a minute or so maybe doubled in size you want to add in one teaspoon of cream of tartar as well as one tablespoon of lemon juice now these two ingredients are not mandatory but they definitely help with the egg whites being able to hold on to those air bubbles because this cake does not use any leavening whatsoever there's no baking powder no baking soda there's no yeast the only way this cake is going to rise is by the air bubbles that we incorporate into the egg white themselves and you want these egg whites to be as stable as possible and that's what the cream of tartar is for is it stabilizes those egg whites so those air bubbles don't break when we go to fold in our dry ingredients now once your egg white mixture comes to soft peaks you want to start adding in your sugar I have done an additional 3/4 of a cup of sugar here and I'm going to slowly start adding that in as my mixer is going now this sugar you want to add it slowly because you want it to resolve as it's mixing in and I know people are going to ask you know can I reduce the amount of sugar you really can't in this recipe that sugar is helps determine the final outcome of your finished cake it's what's going to keep your cake super moist but it's also going to again help stabilize those egg whites and create a very soft fine crumb cake so just keep adding the sugar in until you get it all incorporated and you want to continue whisking this mixture until you get stiff peaks and how do you know when you got stiff peaks when you take the whisk attachment out of your mixer and you create a peak in your egg whites if that peak stands straight up that is a stiff peak if it falls over you've got soft peaks we need to continue whipping that more you want to go until you have stiff peaks but not so stiff that your mixture is dry now once you achieve stiff peaks you can go ahead and add in one teaspoon of vanilla extract and you want to gently fold this in using a spatula now we've worked really hard to create a stiff meringue with lots of air bubbles in it the last thing you want to do is go hog-wild and pop all those air bubbles that you've got suspended in those egg whites so be very gentle and just gently fold this in and once you get that vanilla folded in you can fold in your dry ingredients now again gently fold this be very careful to not go hog-wild you want to mix this just until those dry ingredients are incorporated into the egg white mixture for those of you that are not familiar with folding basically all you do is use your spatula you go around the center and you cut through the middle go around the center cut through the middle that's basically folding you're not stirring you're gently folding the stuff in the bottom of the bowl bringing it to the top and folding it so just keep folding this mixture until you don't see any dry flour remaining and you mixture now I wanna take a second here and talk about angel food cake pans this is the type of tube pan that you want it is a two piece aluminum cake pan angel food cake pan you want to stick with aluminum stay away from nonstick because that will prevent your cake batter from rising up the sides and you want that because again we're not using any leavening here so this cake needs as much help because it can get rising and by using a nonstick pan or greasing the sides it's going to that our cake from rising in the oven so stick with one of these cheap aluminum pans you can find these on eBay or Craigslist garage sales thrift stores you can always find them for less than a dollar most times because people are always getting rid of them once you get those dry ingredients folded into your egg white mixture you can add this mixture to your cake pan again do not grease the sides of this pan this is where you want your cake batter to stick to the pan but just evenly distribute the batter all around the pan and then you want to smooth off the top and you want to bake this in a preheated 350 degree fahrenheit oven for between 40 and 45 minutes now once your cake is nice and golden brown and the toothpick or skewer inserted into the center comes out clean you ought to cool your cake and to do this we're going to do it upside down that's what those little feet or fall on the pan but by cooling this cake upside down it's going to prevent the cake from falling in the pan and it's going to insure that our cake is nice and light and airy and you want to make sure that your cake is completely cooled before you try and remove this from the pan and once your cake is completely cooled you can use a butter knife and go around the outside loosen it from the pan and here is where you will see that it is beneficial to have a two piece pan those angel food cake pans that are just one piece it is a nightmare try to get cake out of there so I definitely suggest getting yourself one of these two piece pans because you can just lift it right out after you get the sides cut free and then using the same knife just run it around the bottom and then you can turn your cake out onto a cake plate now when you go to serve this use a serrated knife to cut your cake and be very gentle when cutting angel food cake this cake is super light and airy and delicate so be very delicate with it when you cut it and then you can serve it up any which way that you choose I like mine which is plain old strawberries maybe a little whipped cream on the side but anyway you decide to serve this it is absolutely incredible it really is the cake of angels it's light its moist its delicate and hopefully I've taken all the intimidation out of making this cake because it really is super simple so I hope you give this recipe a try I would love to know how you like it down below in the comments if you like this video be sure to give it a

Cupcakers!\nWelcome to the channel this Tuesday. Today we are going to make an Angel food Cake. Easy recipes\nAngel food Cake. Before I start with the recipe I want to comment that with this video I'm introducing myself to this year's Cooking bloggers contest. It's organized by Canal Cocina. It is a TV channel dedicated exclusively to cuisine. Whenever you see it opens you appetite. I'm presenting myself to this contest because I love making recipes and above all to share them. And I think that it is the same philosophy that Canal Cocina has. And if you're asking yourself, it's not necessary\nto vote or to do something. Don't worry because I already feel\nyour warmth and your encouragement when I interact with you. A jury will be the ones that choose the winners. So fingers crossed for\nthat I may be one of the chosen ones this year. Having said that, we are going to start with today's recipe. I'm telling you that this is a very light, fluffy and sponge cake. That all's a delight. Hence, its name refers to food of angels. As you will see the cake does not\nhas fats, it feels so light. Neither has baking powder\nsince the trick is in beating the whites to\nget a super fluffy sponge cake. And if you want to enjoy this recipe even more you can add fruit, chocolate, cream and even jam. So if you want to know how to make it\nstay and watch the video because the recipe starts now. To do this we will need:\negg whites, sugar, all purpose flour, extract or essence of vanilla, cream of tartar and a pinch of salt. We start by putting into the mixer the\negg whites, the pinch of salt and the cream of tartar. Beat on medium speed for\n5 minutes to mount the egg whites. The cream of tartar is\na relatively common ingredient in confectionery. And helps to stabilize the egg whites for a stronger meringue. If you can't find it you can omit it from the recipe. But in that case we must then integrate the flour very gently so we don't lower the whites. When we see that whites are\na little mounted we add sugar. Rise the power to high speed and beat for 5 minutes more to finish beating the whites. After adding the sugar, you will see that\nWe get a firm, glossy meringue. Perfect for this recipe. Add the vanilla extract\nand let it integrate with the rest of ingredients. And if you want to add another flavor\nYou can add orange or lemon zest. Or you can also add spices, for example cinnamon. At this point, I show you the firmness of the meringue. As you can see it's consistent and it is necessary to leave like that because after integrating flour it will drop a little,\nYou'll see. With a strainer sift the flour\ndirectly over the mounted egg whites. And to best way to integrate it is to do it with a spatula directly with your hands in circular movements... If we do it with mixer we run the risk of whites lowering and the effort of mounting them would be lost. I remind you that this dough doesn't have\nbaking powder or baking soda. Making sure the end result is light and fluffy It is the air that we introduced when we beat the eggs whites. So you have to keep it as best we can. That is why this step is so important\nSince we must mix with love to integrate well the flour without\nlosing the air in the mounted whites. If parts of the flour are unmixed then during baking inside the\ncake hard balls will be created. And we definitely don't want that. Once you have the flour well\nintegrated we will see that whites lower. But as you can see we still have a very creamy mixture light and mostly airy. So the mix is ready for baking. For this type of cake a pan like this is commonly use. It is made out of aluminum and\nis specific to make Angel food Cake. It has 18 cm in diameter, it is detachable and it also has some legs that serve to let it stand upside down and that air circulates in there. This is very important so the\ncake does not lower while it cools down. Pour the dough directly inside. And you must know that for this type of cake\nwe do not grease the mould. Since this helps to grip well to the walls of the pan and\nin the end is super fluffy. Once ready we move it a bit to smooth the surface and we take it to the pre-heated oven at 170 \u00b0 C preferably with top and bottom heat and no fan. Leave it there for 40 minutes or\nuntil it's completely baked. And to check it you can\npierce it with a toothpick or knife. If the stick comes out clean, it is that it's ready. Freshly baked let it cool down upside down. Thus gravity does its job\nand will not let the cake get down. Once cool it's time to to unmold it. For this we pass a knife through the walls of the pan. Because as you can see it is well attached. And as I said before this is necessary so that the cake rises properly and it's spongy. If you bake it in non-stick pans or other materials for example silicone pans it won't be rise as much. Also like these aluminum pans allow us to use the knife without fear of damaging it. Since they do not have any non-stick coating that can scratch. Once we have separated the pan inside walls we also can take off the base of the cake. And we can now directly\nunmold it on the plate or presentation stand. You will see that the slice looks delicious. You already can enjoy this cake as it is. But in this case we are going to decorate it a little bit. We can do it with whipped cream. Or if you prefer it with a light glaze or chocolate ganache. There are several good options\nthat are perfect for this cake. We put fruit on top. We can use whichever you like most,\nbut I think that strawberries are a tempting touch. And also red looks very good on the cream. We  finish by putting a few\nchocolate shavings, and now it's finished. It is lightweight, super sponge,\nfluffy, beautiful and above all very delicious. Since it has cream and fruit it is best keep it in the fridge or refrigerator until you're ready to serve it. And as I said before I am going to\nshow how this cake looks on the inside. Its interior seems spectacular.\nSince the sponginess is seen clearly. If you take a look you will see that\npressing it makes it go back to its original state. Even when you cut it a\nbit the rest returns to its position. And now we are going to see the Cupcakers\nthat entered the Hall of Fame today.

you that you don't need to use a box mix you can make it from scratch and you can even make it gluten-free like I'm gonna do today the first thing that you need to know how to do is separate an egg because you're gonna need to separate 14 large eggs which is what I am doing right now seems like a lot it is a lot more than a dozen - generally you don't have on hand so go out and buy some eggs to make this dish promise you it will be worth it I'm down to my last egg and I do see that there's one little bit of shell in the bottom of my bowl and I'm gonna show you how you can get that out of your bowl really easily using the edge of your egg shell you just put the egg shell into the egg whites and it'll float right in there there you go Luke and it goes right in there do you see that a little harder when it's that many egg whites but you get the picture now that that's done you have to deal with your flour mixture it's not a lot of ingredients in an angel food cake but they have to be dealt with in a particular way because you want it extra extra light and fluffy right so you need to sift everything four times that really aerates and lightens your mixture and as I promised this is a gluten free angel food cake and I'm using cup 4 cup which is an all-purpose baking flour that's a gluten-free 3/4 of a cup additionally three quarters of a cup of superfine sugar as well as three tablespoons of corn starch now I found that when we were creating this it was a little bit sticky if we didn't use the cornstarch and the cornstarch helps it to stay a little bit drier which is nice because you don't want a sticky cake so sift this four times total you have two balls makes it really easy just pour from bolt-hole these are one of those steps where you're like is that really necessary and I think the answer is yes in this instance a lot of times I don't sift they'll just whisk but for a cake like this where you really need to keep the mixture light you want to make sure that you do it last one guys - the eggs add a half a teaspoon of salt a tablespoon of warm water this helps loosen it up and if your eggs were a little bit cold the water will help with that one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar the cream of tartar helps give better loft to all of these things that we're doing are designed to create or hold the loft of the egg whites while you are mixing and while you're baking whisk that together add a couple teaspoons of vanilla extract it's optional it's for flavor you could use a little bit of lemon so whisk those together start off the mixing process and then transfer it to your mixer and start beating so this has been beating for about three minutes on a medium speed now if you beat on a medium speed you're gonna have a stronger meringue once it sets off Peaks you can start adding the remaining sugar which is a half a cup of superfine sugar just a little bit at a time let it beat in and then add a little bit now once you've added your sugar you can increase the speed to like a medium high or even a high because once the bubbles have been built they'll be strong and you can speed it along a little bit more then you want to continue beating this until stiff glossy peaks form that'll take another minute or so I'm gonna give it a check I really don't think it's done yet but I want to see where I'm at because while you want it to get stiff and glossy you also don't want to overbeat it whoa see it's a good thing I checked because it didn't look like it was that ready but in fact it is how about that you guys thank God I stopped the dry ingredients are gonna be folded in by hand so take your egg whites off the mixer and then in six installments sift the dry ingredients over your egg whites but you run the risk of deflating them a little but this is actually a very strong mixture for all the reasons that I just explained make sure to get all the way down to the bottom of your bowl you want the flour mixture to be well incorporated without being overly worked in make sure that your mixture is properly folded it's not a cap and cake batter you don't want lumps transfer the batter to an ungreased to pan the ungreased miss allows the cake to sort of stick to the sides and rise really well I like the kind that have these little feet they cool upside down and these feet allow you to just turn the cake pan upside down and let it cool without having to try to balance it on something all right do you want to even it out and you want to make sure that there are no air bubbles because then you'll have little pockets in your cakes so spread the top out so that it's even throughout and then you can take either a knife or a small offset spatula or something then I'm going to just run my knife through the cake and that releases air pockets and make sure that there aren't any in there then you can go back and smooth it again get it into your oven 350 degrees for about 40 to 45 minutes the top should spring back when lightly touched you gotta let it cool you got to let it cool completely and it needs to be cooled upside down it's on its little feet turn it over look how golden and beautiful puffed right to the top what you want to do now is loosen the edges I'm gonna do that with a spatula try to keep the spatula really close to the edge because it's not greased for a reason but it does stick a little bit if you don't loosen it now what you can do is just pop it out just pop right out it is called angel food cake deserves that kind of sound right now remove it from the top you can pull it a little bit but go ahead and use the spatula again and just run it around the bottom now this is the part that's really going to show because it's the top so you probably want to be pretty careful not to cut into that too much but there's always ways around it just pile whipped cream on the top of feed do that one little hole once all right beautiful gluten free angel food cake cut yourself a slice use a serrated knife beautiful snowy white gorgeous perfection a little bit of whipped cream maybe or a lot I mean there's no fat than this so hyoe I'm the fat afterwards and how about some berries completely beautiful it's light fluffy pearly white Lewton free angel food cake enjoy", "93oBMeGZ9Y4": "hey welcome to another video and homeowner repair hey when you're working around the house you get hungry too so in this video we're going to show you how to make some angel food pineapple cake it's really easy to make and do a step by step process on how to make it so the first thing you do is come over to you and you want to set it to preheat it to 350 hopefully you don't have an oven like item from 1959 and it was hopefully it was an aside make sure it's on and that's preheating while you're mixing everything together alright so what you'll need to make this is neither a 9 by 13 baking pan preferably nonstick this one's a little old so with them just a stick a little bit so we're gonna use some cooking spray and you're gonna need like a box of angel food cake you can use any brand this is one we just happen to pick up and a can of crushed pineapples this can is 20 ounces and again you can use any kind of pineapple we just happen to pick this one up and you're gonna need a whisk to mix the ingredients together okay so what you're gonna do is gonna add your angel food cake to your mixing bowl just dump it all in and then get rid of the box next you gonna grab your pineapples you don't need to drain the juice out of it you just want to dump it all in juice pineapple the whole nine yards off the top and empty it all in and now what you're gonna do is you're gonna mix the pineapples and the flan this stuff all together all the ingredients angel food cake ingredients like this tilt it so you can see make sure it's all nice and mixed together so we're gonna get it all mixed together and try not to spill any and now you can see this is all mixed together it doesn't really take my Chaput so next is what you're gonna what you want to do is you know when to get 9 by 13 pan and throw a little spring in it slowly on sticks free tea all you ingredients into the into the yam pan so it helps if you have one of these scrape and stuff speed the bullet in this turns out really good it takes I think takes you about three minutes to make it it's really fast to make it's easy to make and it's really good what's everything this is me a pan just kind of spread it out make sure you put your stuff in the sink alright so once you have another speed of 350 aside your angel food cake with the pineapple mixed in into the oven and you're gonna want to set your timer for 30 minutes so make sure you set your timer and then we'll take thirty minutes done yet oh okay so need to take angel food cake the pineapples out of the oven and it's done this is what it will look like let it cool down and then you can cut it up and serve it you can serve it with some ice cream or some fruit like you know strawberries a pineapple blu-rays whatever you might want to put in with it but now we hope you liked the video please subscribe to our Channel and if you have any questions leave a comment and give us a thumbs up or thumbs down let us know how you like the video", "EUW2It_Bhs0": "angel food cake welcome to Sanjeev Kapoor is khazana this is chef Anil row hero and today we're gonna make an angel food cake Wow so when you think of angels what comes to your mind let me think you know I can visualize white light airy flying beautiful so when I talk or when I use all these descriptors they're exactly what angel food cake is a nice light cake with a very light moist and white interior let me walk you quickly through the ingredients before we start making it refined flour egg whites sugar vanilla of an extract a little bit of salt egg white powder now you probably are wondering what happens if I don't have an egg white powder or is there any other ingredients I can use to substitute that no problems if you do not have a white powder the primary function of the egg white powder is to strengthen the protein a little bit so if you don't have a white powder no sweat you can take your eggs crack them separate the whites and keep them all night on your kitchen counter or keep them in a warm place just so that some of the water evaporates and you're left with a slightly higher protein content in your eggs because the structure in this cake comes from your egg whites and flat so we're gonna create a meringue but be very careful be to not over it or over mix the meringue if that happens we're gonna end up with a very dense and a very closed and a very heavy texture that's not something we want we want a very moist light and delicate texture so let me show you how that's done we're gonna take our egg whites and put it in the mixing bowl so now that we have two different quantities of sugar one we are gonna sift with the flour so that's our fine flour when I talk of refined flour I'm talking about something like between a cake and a pastry flour an all-purpose flour you do not want to use a heavier flour because then you'll end up with a very dense and elastic texture which we do not want so this is our pastry flour and sugar we will sift this together make sure the sugar is not too coarse if it is too coarse I recommend it quickly mixing it in your machine or a robot coupe or a grinder and reducing the particle size so this one here is pretty good I'm going to mix the second quantity of sugar with my egg white powder and I'm going to start mixing my meringue now slowly the first step is to make sure that your water in the egg whites and the protein tends to come together so just mix it for a couple of seconds in the egg whites a little bit homogenized before you start adding the sugar okay now I see that the egg whites are starting to come together and getting a little bit of a form or a little bit of aeration going on here this is the time when I'm going to start adding my sugar so make sure you put all your sugar in nice easy swing and then some of the sauce now I know you know you might be asking me chef why are you putting all the sugar in at once it's possible that you must have seen some recipes or some procedures where the sugar goes in a little at a time well in an angel food cake you want a very uniform structure of the cake inside and that is possible with all the sugar in the recipe this was at the same time so do not add parts of sugar and then at the end you have a lot of sugar left over that you put in it's best you put all the sugar in at once in a slow easy steady stream you can see the form is starting to develop I have a nice development of a meringue do not over mix it because like I mentioned earlier any over mixing will cause a separation and you want the texture of the meringue to be nice and fluid and soft so it's very easy to fold in the flour and the sugar and now it's time to put in the almond and the vanilla Wow it's nice and shiny and luscious and silky you can see the development of the meringue is beautiful you want to give the sugar sometimes will dissolve evenly so I'm going to mix it at a gentle pace and let's just check the texture of the meringue oh it's ready I think you do not want to over mix it any more than it is now it has a nice flowing action to it you do not want to mix it to a point where it's excessively stiff because of it's very stiff it's not gonna pour into your cake pans and it's not gonna bake evenly you're gonna have these very stiff dense pockets of meringue in your cake pan you want to make sure you keep it nice and soft and smooth you see the shine and the texture it's flowing really well that's the texture you're looking for now we're gonna fold in our last components which is the flour and the sugar so to facilitate that I'm gonna pour this out to see the texture it's almost like a cloud huh nice and light and airy at the same time it's not too loose either see that now I'm gonna add this in three parts so you dust a little 1/3 on top and the folding is important you see nice and easy motions and you see the egg whites or the meringue is working with me it's not offering any resistance for me to fold in the flour here's the second addition you want to have nice and smooth and easy motions do not get aggressive while mixing keep your hands nice and light it's almost coming together you can see the texture as simpler recipe this is believe me it's very very important or critical that you keep a nice texture of the meringue that's half your batter there if you over mix the meringue the texture of the cake is gonna be very dense and almost there you see if you do it right you have not lost any volume in the mixing process and you end up with a nice smooth uniform luscious silky cake batter before you start mixing before you start working please make sure your oven is pre heated to 180 degrees Celsius now that a cake batter is ready see we're gonna take loaf pans or cake molds and we'll put the batter in now these molds or these pans have not been treated these are non-stick pans you can also use aluminum pans if you have but please do not spray any oil do not spray any grease in there because you want the angel food cake to hold on to the sides of the mold and climb up so we are not doing anything to the most you see how important the consistency is because now you can pour the batter into the cakes it's not offering any resistance so you fill it about I would say 60% way up and if your meringues nice and stable if you mixed it well you should not lose any volume I'm gonna make sure it's on the side into the sheet pan my ovens at 170 Celsius I'm gonna put it in there for about 3540 minutes and then we'll come back have a look let's take a look at our cakes and see if they are baked so I think the cakes are ready now you see a well-developed structure it feels nice and light and airy so the cakes are done now so just to make sure we can do a toothpick test what are the skewer inside and it comes out clean and that's an indication that the cakes are now done so as soon as the cakes come out of the oven we'll have a glazing rack ready and this is an exception because you want to keep the cakes upside down so the cake does not concave in so we'll just place it on a glazing rack so there's a circulation from underneath until the cakes are completely cool and then we'll take them off and we'll unmold them so now that the angel food cake has come to room temperature you see it's nice and soft we're gonna try to unmold this so the best way is to gently go around the edges and clear the cake please make sure you do not cut into the cake okay so walk the knife edge along the edge of the mold of the cake pan and make sure it's released and we're gonna give it one nice place and there it is so that's your angel food cake you see it's a nice golden brown all around nice and even structure and you see how moist and soft the texture is this is how it should be when an angel food cake is served the crushed or the top of the cake is normally to the bottom because that's what the crust formation is so if the crust was on top because of the delicate texture you would force the structure of the cake to compress so therefore the crust acts as a base and the soft part of the cake is on the top for us to easily cut it so the texture and the structure of the cake is so inviting you know I can't wait to see the interior and to indulge so we have to very delicately try to maintain the structure of the cake and slice it through and you see the crust a nice even uniform texture you see how moist it is it's a great summer springtime cake and for those of you are very health conscious you have some good news it's fat-free it's a wonderful light dessert it's a wonderful light cake to be served with some marinated fruits berries and it's really really light and refreshing so to finish you lightly dusted with powdered sugar and can be served with some marinated berries some strawberries and some fresh cream enjoy", "sQTW7gWt7Mo": "Hi Guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode\nof Laura in the Kitchen, I am so excited to share with you my recipe for Chocolate Angel\nFood Cake. Now I made a traditional angel food cake here a couple years ago but I was\npersonally craving a chocolate angel food cake this morning and my husband was too,\nand then we decided to just film it for you because it's just a great all-purpose cake\nrecipe to have on hand because it's so good and I personally love anything angel food\ncake because it's so light and fluffy. Okay so let's go over the ingredients so we\ncan get started. You'll need some unsweetened cocoa powder,\nsome cake flour, instant espresso powder, granulated sugar, egg whites, some cream of\ntarter, salt and vanilla extract. That's it! I know! It's one of my favorite things because it's\nso easy and only requires a handful of ingredients. The first thing you want to do is get your\noven preheated to 350F, once that's out of the way everything else is pretty much done. What I have here are some eggs whites, now\nI've got some regular egg whites and then I also have some egg whites that you buy in\nthe carton where it's just all egg whites, and I used a little bit of that as well because\nI wanted to use it up. So I am using a combination of the two but you can use - I prefer to use\nall regular fresh egg whites if I can but I rather - I just had a little bit of it left\nlike a quarter cup so I figure I mind as well use it. I am going to make this in my standing mixer\nfitted with a whisk attachment because, let's face it, to whip these to stiff peaks by hand\nis going to take a lifetime and a half and you'll give up because it's not that easy. I'm also adding my cream of tarter and my\nsalt at this point and I am going to whisk my egg whites until they are light and frothy. Once your egg whites are nice and frothy you're\ngoing to start adding your sugar but you are going to add it just a tablespoon at a time.\nI know! It looks like it's a lot of work, but it's not. It isn't. Let's be honest. And now what you're going to do is you are\ngoing to let this whisk until your egg whites are nice stiff peaks. It's really important\nthat there are nice stiff peaks otherwise your cake will not hold. So just - that's why doing in the standing\nmixer is just so easy. That is perfect. Now, please do not be discouraged - look at\nthat stiff peaks - do not be discouraged if this - if you feel like it is not getting\nto the right consistency because whipping egg whites to this consistency can take a\ngood ten minutes, which is how long it took me. Now what I am going to do is I am going to\njust take my flour, cocoa and instant espresso and I am just going to pass this through a\nsieve, only because you know, sometimes the cocoa powder tends to be a bit clumpy and\nthe thing about this is that you want everything to be super, super smooth because it's meant\nto be a really light and airy cake. So taking a two seconds to pass it through a sieve like\nI did. See those? You don't want the clumps of that to in your cake, so you just take\nyour spatula and you pass it through and you're good to go. Okay. Now what I am going to do is I am going\nto add my vanilla, a good teaspoon and a half or so, just eyeball it. And then I am going to add my dry ingredients\nin thirds because I don't want to add it all at one time, I want to do this very gently\nand you want to always fold, you don't want to whisk this in otherwise you will lose those\n- the air from the egg whites so just go around and then just in the center. Around and in the center. And that's how you\nproperly fold in dry ingredients into egg whites. And then just continue to do this\nuntil you have all your dry ingredients mixed in and you'll be pretty much done. That looks\ngorgeous. It almost looks like a chocolate whipped cream. I want to eat it as-is. Now, I am going to put this into a ten inch\ntube pan and now the important thing is, contrary to everything else we do, you do not want\nto grease this. It is important - now normally you want to\ngrease everything really, really well to make sure the cake comes out but in this case you\ndon't want to grease this, you want it ungreased, ten inch and this is a non-stick as well.\nI'm just trying to get everything out of here and then we will even it all out. I just don't\nwant to waste any of this batter because that will mean that there is less cake for me to\neat. So let me get it all out of here and then we are going to even it all out. Now\ndon't worry if you have a little white spot from the batter that didn't get completely\nmixed in with the chocolate, it's fine. Think of it as like a marbled piece. It's\ndelicious either way. Just even this out with your spatula. I think that looks good enough. I'm not quite\nsure I can get it any more even than this. So let's call it day. Let's call it even. I mean come on, that looks too good. Take a knife and I'm going to run it around\nthe edges and I'm even going to run it in the center a little bit, like so. I know that\nsound crazy and it looks a little bit insane but what that does is it settles any air bubbles\nwhich is really important. You don't want any air bubbles in this. And the I am going\nto flatten it out one more time, just because - I'm done. Okay. I am going to put this one a baking sheet\njust because it's easier to get in and out of the oven. The oven is preheated to 350F,\nthis will go in there for about 45 minutes or so. You'll know when it's ready when you\ntouch the top and it springs back on itself, you'll know it's completely done. Then I'll\nshow you what we do as soon as it comes out. Once your cake comes out of the oven - now\nyou can - you have to put this to cool upside down - you can do one of two things - or more\nthan that if you're craftier. You can put this upside down on a wine bottle, or you\ncan do what I'm doing and I just put a couple of cans in each corner, like so. It's not\nas dangerous, we're not living on the edge like we were if we were putting it upside\non a wine bottle but if you follow me on my vlog channel, you'll know I have a tendency\nto break things. And today luck is just not on my side. So\nI am just going to put it like this because it is just the safe thing to do and this needs\nto cool completely on - upside down like this. So don't touch it. Don't go anywhere near\nit. Let it cool completely and I will show you what it looks like when it's cooled and\nthen we can slice and eat. In this belly. Now this is cooled completely I just flipped\nit over. And now I am going to take a butter knife and I am just going to run this around\nthe edge of the pan just to loosen things up because remember, this has not been greased.\nWell this was not greased so you just have to take your time and run it around to loosen\nthings up a bit. And then also, make sure you do the same thing\nin the center here. Just going to take a serrated knife and cut my self a little piece. This smells really good, by the way this entire\nkitchen smells amazing. Oh look at that! Ah, it is so - I can't even describe it to\nyou - it's just incredible. That's the marbled piece I was talking to you about. That's like - that's like lighter than air. It totally hits the spot. I was wanting chocolate angel food cake and\nmy nonna's ricotta cookies, so I made both. Because when all else fails, anything chocolate,\nand any nonna recipe, always hits the spot. This is absolutely delicious. It's chocolaty, but yet it's not bitter or\ntoo strong. It's almost nice and subtle but it really pops through because of the espresso\npowder.

(calm music) This angel food cake is super\nlight, fluffy and tender and it comes together\nwith only six ingredients. It's got amazing flavor and is way better than any store-bought\nversion you could buy. So to get started, you're\ngonna have your flour. We're gonna add half of our sugar to it. It's just white granulated\nsugar and a little salt. Mix those together a little bit. We're gonna start and sift five times. This part's definitely a little tedious but it's well worth it when you get that light and airy crumb. The next thing we're gonna do is start with our egg\nwhites and whip those. You're gonna wanna use your\nmixer and your whisk attachment. We'll go ahead and start\nwhipping these egg whites until they get a little bit frothy. All right, so we've got\nthese bubbles on top. It's nice and frothy. So we're gonna add our cream of tartar and our vanilla extract. Vanilla extract adds flavor and the cream of tartar helps to make the egg whites\nmore stable as they whip. We're gonna turn it up to medium speed and from here, we're gonna add\nthe remainder of the sugar. You wanna give about five to 10 seconds between each tablespoon that you're adding so you can give it time to\nincorporate into the egg whites. Now, once all of your\nsugar has been added, you're gonna turn your\nmixer up to high speed. All right, see where they're at. All right, so now our egg\nwhites are pretty stiff. They're standing straight up. Now we're gonna add our flour\nmixture into our egg whites. We're gonna add it in four parts just to be sure everything\nis still light and fluffy and we're gonna sift it as it's added. We're gonna gently fold\nit into our egg whites so that we don't deflate it\nas we're adding the flour. Generally, when you're folding something into something else, you're just kind of running\nyour spatula around the outside and be careful not to deflate them. Once everything looks like\nit's well incorporated, we're done with that. You're gonna wanna use a tube\npan for your angel food cake. It's gonna have this removable bottom. So we have these feet to\nhelp turn it upside down for cooling and we leave it ungreased so it doesn't fall out of your pan. So let's go ahead and add\nour egg white mixture. Such a nice looking fluffy batter. Just gets you so excited\nto eat it when it's done 'cause you just know\nit's gonna be amazing. So once you've got your\nbatter in your pan, I like to use my trusty offset spatula to spread it around evenly. All right, so you'll wanna\npop it into a 375 degree oven and bake it for about 20 to 30 minutes. (calm music) All right, so once your\ncake comes out of the oven, you're gonna wanna flip it over so that it cools upside\ndown and doesn't deflate. So this is where the feet on\nthe pan really come in handy as you flip it over and as long as you didn't grease your pan, your cake should stay exactly\nwhere it's supposed to and you let it cool\nupside down for one hour. So once your cake has cooled,\nwe're gonna flip it back over and it's time to remove it from the pan. I'll take my spatula and run\nit around the edge of the cake and you can also do it\non the inside of the pan and then from there we should\njust be able to lift it up and out of our pan. All right, so you're just\ngonna flip that over now and onto your cake stand. From there, you can\nserve it just as it is. You can serve it with some\nwhipped cream, fresh berries. I love to add some fresh\nberries to the top of it. Makes it look kind of nice and fresh. Makes a nice presentation\nand such a lovely light cake. And here we've got our moist,\nfluffy, tender angel food cake with a lovely kiss of vanilla flavor. Find the recipe on my\nwebsite, lifeloveandsugar.com.

it starts with a boxed cake mix but we're not gonna tell anybody that to get started we are gonna take just a clean lint-free kitchen towel and we're gonna lay it out on the counter we're gonna take a bowl with some powdered sugar if you have one of these handy-dandy little sisters they work great if you don't you can just sprinkle it with a spoon or your fingers that is fine too this is just a box angel food cake that we have mixed together we've poured it in a sheet pan and baked it until it's golden brown it's still nice and hot this step is really important the cake has got to be hot when you roll it we're gonna dump it out onto our sugared towel and roll it up roll it up with the towel inside now we're gonna set this aside to cool before we can fill it while our cake is cooling we're gonna make our filling we're gonna start with one package of cream cheese and now we're gonna beat this until it's smooth so now that it's smooth we're just gonna add our powdered sugar and a little bit of vanilla we're just gonna mix that until it's combined now we're gonna add in our heavy whipping cream you want this nice and cold so that it whips up into stiff peaks we know that it's done when it's nice and thick and fluffy once our cake roll is all cool depen we're ready to fill it with our cream cheese whipped cream do you want to make sure that your cake is totally cool when you roll it or your filling will just melt we're gonna take half of our cream cheese whipped cream and we're gonna put it right in the middle so we're just gonna spread this out you want to leave just a little space on the edges so that it doesn't squish out too much when you roll it up once our filling is nice and smooth we're gonna add our berries this is a good time to get creative if you want you can add any in season fruit you could add different candies you can even flavor your feeling differently if you like we're gonna start rolling this up this can be a little bit tricky because it's pretty full you want to go slowly so at this point we're just going to put it on our serving platter and decorate it so we're on top we're gonna add the rest of our cream cheese whipped cream and we're just gonna spread it all over now that we've got it covered we're just going to use the rest of our berries we're gonna put them on the top so people know what's inside so there you have it a super simple summer dessert and no one is ever gonna know that it all started with a cake mix for this recipe and more go to the recipe rebel calm you", "z0Vg83tDXDo": "so today we are gonna be doing some grilled cake it's all sorts of delicious with some drunk you know rum soaked pineapple slices all sorts of yummy delicious on the grill so today we're gonna do the method for grilling cake and fruits on the grill I've got a store-bought well angel food cake why because it's easy I cut line into 8 equal slices it's a good idea to slice them in equal portions cuz they all grill about the same time I've got a whole pineapple here I cut into rings I like the nice thick slices too because there's kinda like more meteor it grills up nicer also if you cut them really thin you're gonna end up with like little charred pieces not some rum it's a beautiful golden rum and notice that wasn't very much I don't think you need a lot of it it's just a hint of rum goodness on there leave it on the counter while you address your cake now if you really want something completely unique and different take this hot sauce and drizzle it into the rum or right directly onto the pineapple because what you're gonna get is heat sweet and just something different with your cake slices you want to take some melted butter now you can use it if you don't have to use it I personally love butter on cake when it goes to a grill because it gives you that delicious caramelized texture off the grill that's what makes it special and so I've got a little bit of melted butter good quality butter non unsalted and you just want to brush your slices with the butter just gently pop them back and do it all for all eight slices we take all of these ingredients we go to the grill the pineapple goes on the grill first why it's gonna take longer to cook than the cake so we're gonna leave this we're gonna close our grill and come back in a couple of minutes and start our cake so we are back at at the grill and we are you know taking a look at our gorgeous pineapple slices they're beautiful they're thick they're delicious and the best part about them we're getting some gorgeous gorgeous grill marks on them the wetter the surface of the meat or the protein of the fruit the longer it's gonna take to get grill marks it is now time to grill the cake I do you just like this is so good however we're gonna get it better why better well butter made it better first of all and now that grilling is gonna make it better because you know what happens when you know beautiful sugary caked coated and butter hits the grill things caramelize you know what happens with caramelization the texture changes and that just is like it's all sorts of goodness it really is now this stage goes really fast though you actually probably want to work with your grill lid up right now because this grill is sitting at about 600 degrees now now look at that that's only been on four seconds I'm not so worried about the pineapple actually it's fine it's nice and thick it's not gonna get overdone the cake though this is where you want to be standing right here beside your grill or grill marks kids now I'm doing the turn I'm doing the turn so I'm going whole other direction now turn your cake in a holy direction why well cuz it just looks pretty there's really no logical reason for it because we get more grill marks and a lot of times more is better more of the surface of this cake is caramelized and that's the texture that everybody loves you know imagine this you just had a great meal outside you know you've done your steaks and your salad and your side dishes and everything else now this is where you'd normally you know bring out something you baked in the oven why do it on the grill you might as well you're already there and people love it grilled pineapple Kona you know let's get it's soft enough now it goes a darker deeper you know queue of yellow when you get to the stage all it is this is about pulling it together it's so easy I go back to this time and time again no matter what because this recipe and this method works so easy all you have to do take a piece of cake well that's a piece of pineapple so we've got some heavy whipped cream here the good stuff don't be buying that fake crap okay and because it's kind of like a tropical theme I actually just toasted off some coconut and it's like a cocktail on a plate almost at this point if your peaches are in season or your plums are in season heck even apples grow those you like pound cake you like angel food cake swap out pancake use that instead this is like one of the best interchangeable recipes that you can use on the grill one method countless possibilities the recipes right below us in the description

kitchen I have another back - cake basics episode for you and today I'm going to show you how to make an angel food cake now I love this dress because it's super super easy to make and it's really versatile it requires very few ingredients as well so essentially angel food cake is like another sponge cake except this one is made with just egg whites no egg yolks involved it's really light and fluffy delicate today I'm going to prepare it using a really classic funnel cake pan you can also use this recipe to create single cake layers you can make cupcakes out of this recipe can make a sheet pan cake out of this and then use whatever frosting and whatever topping you would like let's get started and I'll show you how it's made and before we get started on the ingredients and the cake let's talk about the mixing bowl because it's actually super important it's really important to start with a very clean mixing bowl that doesn't have any grease so you can use some degreasing soap I also like to just rinse the inside with some white vinegar and it really strips off any of the grease so once that's really nice and clean wipe it dry and then let's get started so I have 12 egg whites it's about 2 cups of egg whites I'm going to pour these into my mixer bowl next I'm going to add in one and a half cups of white granulated sugar and next I'm going to turn on my mixer to low speed I'm going to let the sugar and egg whites mix together for about two to three minutes on low speed so some of that sugar has a chance to get dissolved before I start whisking the egg whites and after a few minutes I'm going to turn the speed up to high and whisk this for another six to eight minutes until I have stiff and glossy Peaks and once my egg whites are light and fluffy I'm going to add in one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract and then give this who makes for another 30 seconds and my egg whites are all done I just wanted to show you guys how full I feed these are you want to waste them until you get really nice stiff peaks and then go ahead and clean off your whisk and now we're ready to add in the dry ingredients for my dry ingredients I have one and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour and I've already pretty saved to this and I'm going to sift it again into this mixture to the flour I'm going to add in a quarter teaspoon of salt now it's really important to add and mix in the flour really gently and carefully so I'm going to sift the flour and increments into the egg whites and then fold from the bottom of the mixing bowl after each addition I had in a little bit at a time because this cake gets all its volume from the egg whites if you deflate those egg whites this early in the stage you might as well just toss it out into the garbage because it just won't work so grab a spatula and very gently start from the bottom and just incorporate that flour now my mixing bowl is really large if you have a smaller mixing bowl you may have to transfer the egg whites into a larger bowl and to do this properly because you want to make sure that everything gets incorporated so at this point I've added in all my flour and you can see that the egg whites are still really light and voluminous and I'm scraping from the bottom of the bowl so sometimes that flour will just fall into the bottom of the mixing bowl that's why you want to make sure that you're using your spatula to scrape everything from below as well and now we're ready for the pan and today I'll be using this nine-inch funnel cake pan now the inside needs to be left ungreased otherwise the cake will not rise properly but I do like to line that bottom with some parchment paper so that the top stays really nice so I'm just gonna grab a little circle of parchment paper going to line where the circle is on the inside and we'll cut it out and then that way we'll have some parchment paper for the inside [Music] let's try that out and see if it fits yes that fits beautifully perfect I have my pan all prepped and it's just super super important that inside the pan is really clean because any amount of grease can really bring down the volume of the cake so leave it on greased line the bottom with the parchment paper if you want to it'll also work without the parchment paper but it'll be a little bit harder to take it out of the pan now just grab your spatula and then transfer that batter into the cake pan I'm just gonna drop keeping spatula folds of the batter right over and I have my oven preheated to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and this cake is going to bake for about 40 to 45 minutes you want the top to be set so when you touch it on the top it should just spring right back and once we take it out I'll show you how to cool it down will invert it onto a cooling rack and let it cool completely and you want to level out this batter [Music] I also like to give this pan a few hard taps against the work surface and given your pan a few hard taps against the counter it's just going to ensure that you don't have any air pockets trapped underneath somewhere where you don't see just make sure it's really nice and level and this is ready to go into the oven I literally just took my angel food cake out of the oven and it smells so good it has a really light golden brown color on the top I'm going to place a wire rack over the top and we're going to invert the angel food cake and let it cool like this so what this does is it helps keep the cake really light and fluffy because if you leave it cooling right-side up the cake will just slowly start to settle down I'll become more flat and this will actually stay really light and fluffy and we'll just keep it inverted like this for a couple hours allowing it to cool all right so my angel food cake has cooled for a couple hours it's completely cooled down I'm gonna grab a knife and gently run it along the edges of the cake just to release it from the pan remember we didn't grease the sides of this cake pan so we're going to need to use a knife to release it going to grab a pretty little cake stand and invert the cake onto it and to cut this cake you'll want to use a serrated a sharp serrated knife because it is a very light sponge cake and anything that's not serrated is just gonna squish it flat and check out this texture on the inside this angel food cake is super light and fluffy it's a really really delicate and it's the perfect cake if you want something very simple I'm gonna just top it off with some powdered sugar and berries and that's it guys from my easy angel food cake I love how it turned out it's just so light and fluffy for the full printable recipe just head on down into the video description box I've left a link that will take you over to my website where you can print this recipe off and share it with your family and friends now time to dig in and enjoy and I've broken off a little piece for myself here just I love the texture so light and fluffy [Music] I absolutely love how light and fluffy and delicate this angel food cake is it is so so delicious and I also really like that this recipe in particular isn't very sweet sometimes if you pick up an angel food cake at the store it's just so sweet like overwhelmingly sweet you just really can't even eat it this version doesn't have as much sugar so it's gonna be perfect for layered cakes for cupcakes for sheep pancakes you can even just enjoy it plain like this I hope you guys have enjoyed this recipe give it a try next time you're looking for a simple cake recipe and I'll see you next time with another recipe [Music]", "uxu3z5gDxuo": "so I decided I'm gonna make a chocolate angel food cake it's a angel food cake with chocolate chunks what sort of chocolate flakes and a dark chocolate lace on the top so the first thing I have to do is sift together half a cup of sugar and one in 1/3 cups of cake flour it's actually just regular cake flour it's not self-rising be sure you get the right one I'm just going to sift it together four times just to make sure it's really well combined perfectly now this is the key to really good angel food cake is room-temperature eggs I have about 1 and 1/2 cups which is 10 to 12 egg whites okay so I need 3/4 of teaspoon salt one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar so I'm going to eat these up for about a minute until they get sort of soft peaks and then we're gonna add lots of superfine sugar one and a half cups of superfine sugar [Music] but that alone is gonna get very shiny it's starting to get really thick and shiny and it's in the hold of you [Music] see how firm they are that's great that's exactly what we want them so when you take the beater out it stands up all by itself on it holds a peak okay now I just want to add some vanilla then I'll make the rest of the cake one teaspoon of good vanilla okay that's good for the egg whites okay it's really important not to deflate the egg whites so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put the egg whites into a big bowl and then very carefully fold the flour that's mixed with the sugar into it okay looks like an angel food cake I'm ready so I'm gonna just stir this in very carefully just take the spatula and go right down in the middle and then fold it over and just keep moving the ball around like that that's really a classic way to fold something it's like when you're doing mooses or angel food cake it disturbs the WIPP thing as little as possible okay this looks like it's nicely folded in you don't want to overdo it just enough and now the good part I'm gonna put chocolate in it so I need about a half a cup of grated chocolate this is this good semi-sweet chocolate don't want to use chocolate chips because they have stabilizers in them you just want regular chocolate and you want to do it on the course that's great okay that should be about half a cup whoa it's everywhere let's go put this right in just fold the chocolate right in mmm it smells good okay just enough so that it's folded in but not so much that you deflate the egg whites okay so I've got an ungreased 10-inch angel food cake pan I'm just gonna pour this whole thing right in just do it really carefully it's a great summer dessert because it's got a lot of flavor but it's really light not a heavy dessert clearly just smooth the top and bake this 350 degrees for about 35 to 40 minutes I'm gonna see what Miguel is up to and when the cakes done I'm gonna go shopping okay I need something for the top of my chocolate angel food cake I would say chocolate chips is a good place to start so the black and white angel food cake came out pretty good but I'm gonna make it extra good with a drizzle of chocolate ganache on the top so I need about a half a pound of chocolate chips just like that I'm gonna pour some heavy cream on it and melt it and it makes ganache it's sort of chocolate drizzle on top just melt it together I'm just taking a minute so have a better half a pound of chocolate chips semi-sweet chocolate chips and about 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream okay while the chocolates melted I'm gonna get the cake set up so what I've done is I take a little piece of parchment paper and I'll put them right between the cake and the pedestal and that way when I drizzle the chocolate on they'll keep the pedestal really nice and clean and I can just pull them out I'm a beautiful cake in the pedestal okay and say that's just perfect you want it so it's thick enough to stay in the cake and thin enough so it'll drizzle down the side that doesn't look half bad [Music] it's nice all the way around it works for me [Music] and I'd say we have a nice dessert for the party [Music]", "bq-JyXkZT_k": "Today on Sugar Spun Run, I'll be showing you how to make an angel food cake completely from scratch Angel food cake is a light airy and so simple to make cake while it might look plain The name for this cake is very appropriate because the texture and taste is absolutely heavenly This angel food cake recipe is my mom's recipe. It's one she's been making for years and everywhere She takes it people always want the recipe. To start, you will need to pre-heat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit You're also going to need a tube pan for this recipe I recommend using one with a removable bottom as you can see this pan is well used and well-loved now grab a medium-sized bowl and add 1 and 1/4 cups of powdered sugar Next you'll need the flour now, we always make this cake using all-purpose flour So you will need 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour However, this cake can also be made with cake flour if you prefer or if you happen to have that on hand, if you use cake flour, you'll need  to use 1 cup. Add this in with your powdered sugar and then whisk your sugar and flour together. Until they're well combined and set these aside Next you're going to want to measure out 1 cup of granulated sugar and set this aside as well Now lets get to the eggs. You're going to need 1 and 1/2 cups of egg whites for this recipe These should be at room temperature and for me, this is usually about 10 to 12 eggs It is extremely important that the bowl that you're adding your eggs to is completely clean and dry and grease free If it's not your egg whites could end up not whipping like they're supposed to. Also when cracking your eggs It's very important that you don't get any of the yolks in with the white. I usually crack my eggs in a separate small bowl and then add the white to a measuring cup. That way if I do get some egg yolk contamination, I'm only wasting one egg instead of all of the ones I've already cracked now pour your egg whites into the bowl of your stand mixer and add one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar one and a half teaspoons of vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract and 1/4 teaspoon of salt Now you can use a whisk or paddle attachment with your mixer I'm just using my paddle attachment today and stir these together until they're just combined Now gradually increase your mixer speed to high. With the mixer running on high you're going to want to add about a tablespoon of sugar at a time, adding another tablespoon only after the first has been dissolved It usually takes about 10 to 15 seconds for the sugar to dissolve. If you're mixing your egg whites in a metal bowl, You can usually tell by the sound of the sugar scraping against the bowl. Once you no longer hear that, you know the sugar has been dissolved. Alright, now beat this mixture until the egg whites reach stiff peaks and what this means is that if you lift The beater out of the mixture the peak that forms will hold its shape It will not fold over or fall back into itself. The mixer will be thickened, glossy and as you see it will have increased greatly in volume Now remove your bowl from your stand mixer and go ahead and grab your flour and sugar mixture from earlier Gradually about 1/4 of the flour mixture at a time add this to your egg white mixture And use a clean spatula to gently fold the ingredients together Now it is very important when you're doing this that you do not over mix the batter You do not want to deflate your egg whites So take care and stir just until the ingredients are well combined. Do make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl So that you don't miss any of the egg white mixture. Ok now grab that tube pan that we talked about earlier This is a 10-inch tube pan and you do not want to grease this, just use it as is, and now Spread angel food cake batter evenly into the tube pan. Now use a knife or an icing spatula To cut through the batter. What this is doing, is we're going to get rid of any air bubbles that may exist in your batter All right. Now, let's bake our into a food cake in our 375 degree fahrenheit oven for about 35 minutes or until the top Springs back lightly when touched. Any cracks in your angel food cake should look dry. While the cake is baking You're going to want to grab a can or a bottle that you can invert your tube pan onto when it's done baking I just use a can now immediately Once the cake is done baking you're going to take that and invert that onto your can or your bottle and then allow it to cool completely this can take several hours I do want to note that if you have a tube pan that has the prongs on the end meant for just flipping it Right over and standing it up like that I don't recommend using those. I have found that it pulls the sides of the pan away from the cake and can cause the cake to Actually fall out. You don't want that So even if you have a cake pan like that I still recommend using a can or a bottle to cool your angel food cake once your cake is finished cooling go ahead and remove it from the can of the bottle and use a sharp knife to Cut around the sides of the cake to remove the cake from the edge of the pan. I will usually also run the knife around the center of the tube pan to break it away from that as well now because we used a tube pan with a removable bottom you can go ahead and lift up your cake Then invert it onto a serving platter Again grab your knife and use that to separate the bottom of the cake from a tube pan. Now your angel food cake is ready to slice and serve, because of the light airy texture of this cake I recommend using a sharp serrated knife like a bread knife and using that to gently saw through the cake We always like to top our angel food cake off with homemade whipped cream and fresh berries And that is how you make my favorite completely from scratch angel food cake. I know I say this a lot, but I really do think you guys are going to love this recipe. It's easy and it tastes a million times better than anything you're ever going to get from the store or out of the box I really hope you'll try it out for yourself and please if you do leave me a comment and let me know what you think Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you next time", "DTGRhlIouOQ": "Today I'm gonna show you how my wife\nmade her own angel food cake for her quarantined birthday and we topped it\nwith delicious boiled icing hi I'm Amanda van der Gulik from www.cleverdoughcakes.com and if you enjoy yummy baking recipes and fun cake decorating ideas\nthen make sure that you do hit subscribe and hit that notification bell so that\nyou'll know the minute my next recipe comes out to share with you so for this\nangel food cake recipe we used a Duncan Hines angel food cake in a box so my\nwife dumped the angel food cake box ingredients into a bowl and then added\nwater the amount of water that you need is written on the box then she mixed the\ncake ingredients for 30 seconds at low speed with a whisk and then one minute\nat medium speed with the whisk you can also use a mixer to do this instead of\nwhisking it by hand my wife likes to make her baking by hand I like using the\nmixer because well with my lung condition it's a little bit more\ndifficult for me to do things by hand so whichever works best for you the angel\nfood cake mixture will be light and fluffy and have lots of air bubbles\nready to make the cake really rise when you bake it okay so we did not have a\nbunch pan to make the angel food cake in so this is a special trick that you can\ndo if you don't have a bundt pan or tube pan but you do have a round cake pan simply take\nyour cake pan you can see that we used a springform cake pan here and you take a\nglass and you put water in it and you set that in the center of your pan and\nthat will create a bundt pan make sure that the glass is filled with water\nthough so that it won't crack in the oven for the angel food cake you\nactually don't need to wax or line or butter your pan you just pour it\nstraight in you will have to sort of scrape it loose when it's finished but\nyou don't want the grease in the pan because it will affect the quality\nof the angel food cakes so just pour it straight in as you can see we had a\nsprinkled version of the angel food cake and all those sprinkles sunk to the\nbottom of the batter so my wife just scraped them out with her spatula and\nkind of evenly distributed them around the keep the pan\nmy wife has made lots of birthday cakes for myself and my children especially\nsince I am now a little bit more incapable of making myself\ndepending on the day in the state of my lungs but this was the first time she's\nmade her own birthday cake and it was during quarantine and I'm so grateful to\nher for doing that because I was very weak the week of her birthday so it was\nreally helpful that she helped bake it and it makes it special when you are\npart of your own cake decorating and your own cake baking now our oven is a\nlittle bit hotter than it should be just the older ovens tend to lose their exact\ntemperature abilities over time and so what my wife is she actually placed our\npan on top of another baking tray with a silicone mat in between and the reason\nwe did that was so that it would diffuse the heat a little bit and not burn the\nbottom of the cake the actual temperature that we pre set the oven to\nreally depends on the instructions on the box so make sure you do take a look\nat the box instructions when you're making your angel food cake and you'll\nwant to move this cake very gently to the oven if you don't have a bundt pan\nbecause you don't want that glass to shift as you move it do make sure that\nyou place your angel food cake in the center of your oven so that the heat\nwill be equally distributed around the cake as it's baking our box recommended\nbaking it for 38 minutes so we set the timer and waited until it was ready if\nyou're using a bundt pan when your cake is finished you actually turn the bundt\ncan up so our bundt pan upside down and you put like a glass bottle underneath\nit in the center of it to hold it and that will help it to cool itself but\nbecause we didn't have a bundt pan instead this is what we did we took a\nbaking rack at my cooling rack and my wife put it on top of four glasses to\nreally make sure we had air all around the pan\nlet it cool evenly you'll know when the angel food cake is done when it has a\nlittle bit of a crust on top that's starting to separate and you stick a\ntoothpick in I'll write in the description below how to do the\ntoothpick test and have it come out clean then carefully remove your angel\nfood cake from the oven so that you're not going to spill the water if you're\nusing your homemade version of a bundt pan like we did set it on your cooling\nrack and let it cool completely this can take an hour or choos but let\nit cool completely it is also often recommended to actually let it cool\ncompletely in the oven what you would do is turn the oven off and then open the\noven a tiny bit usually oven doors tend to have like a little hinge where\nthey'll stay to stay open with a little gap and let it cool in the oven as the\noven cools you can see here how in the center of the cake where the glass is\nit's a lighter shade so it just cooked a little bit differently if you had a\nmetal glass then it would be dark just like the side of the cake where the\nmetal is but that's perfectly fine I just wanted to explain that to you as\nthe cake cools you'll see how it starts to separate from the side of the glass\nwhich makes it really easy to pull the glass out once it's cool then just\nsimply give it a little wiggle and pull the glass right out and you can see into\nthe cake there see all those bubbles those lovely light bubbles of an angel\nfood cake once your cake is cold you can take it off of your cooling rack\nor in our case we just removed the glasses underneath the cooling rack to\nmake it a little easier to get to before removing the cake from the cake pans so\nas I mentioned before because we did not actually line the inside of the cake pan\nwith butter or with a parchment paper because we didn't want any of the wax or\nthe grease to touch the angel food cake you can actually use parchment paper\nthat would be fine but to get the shape of the cake pan we didn't use anything\nso we took a special icing spatula an offset spatula and loosened the cake\nfrom the pan before opening up the springform cake pan\nas you can see a little bit of the batter had seeped through the bottom of\nthe springform cake pan so it's stuck to the silicone mat underneath so we just\nneeded to quickly carefully rather make that loose and then my wife was able to\nremove the side of the springform springform pan off of the cake and then\nshe flipped it over onto our cake tray which is going to be where we're going\nto store the cake to remove the bottom of the springform pan pan and as you can\nsee she needed to just use the offset spatula to loosens the bottom of the\ncake pan from the cake as well tada and here is our baked angel food cake look\nat all those sprinkles isn't that exciting\nand now it was time to ice our angel food cake with boiled icing which you\ncan see in this video here boiled icing is so light and fluffy it's a perfect\ncombination for such a light and fluffy angel food cake and it just melts in\nyour mouth it's like eating a Swiss meringue without the butter in it and\nthen it was time to ice the angel food cake and as you can see I had some\nenergy left so I was able to ice the food cake for my wife's birthday so that\nat least I was doing a part of her birthday cake for her I plopped on three\npiles of the boiled icing on top and then using my offset spatula I smooth it\naround the top and down into the center and then around the side boiled icing is\nso easy to use it's smooth so easily and beautifully and it holds its form really\nwell and you keep it fresh in the fridge boiled icing or whipped meringue icing\ncan be a little bit tricky to make so that's why I created a special video for\nyou to show you exactly how to make it because when we made this boiled icing\nwe actually failed twice and then succeeded on the third try and it's\nreally funny so I highly recommend you check it out and then you can know how\nto avoid those mistakes as well then I've completely covered the angel food\ncake with the boiled icing I was a little bit exhausted so my wife went\nback to doing the decorating of her own Quarantine birthday cake and she took\nthe offset spatula and did the little divots on the top to kind of whip up the\ndelicious boiled icing so that it had little Peaks make it look pretty we had\nsome green colored sugar sprinkles left over from another cake that we had done\na while ago and because it's sugar it kept really well so my wife sprinkled\nthat on top just to add that yummy sugar crunch when we were eating the cake and\nto make it look a little bit prettier more festive and then to make it even\nyummier and prettier my wife actually had chopped up or or ground up some\nchocolate chips and a little bit of coffee\ncrystals and put it together in a shaker and then shook on this mocha chocolate\nflavor on top of the cake oh my gosh it was so delicious just take a look at\nthat aren't you just dying to bite into it oh my gosh it was delicious\nhonestly just doing this video for you is making me drool I want to eat this\ncake it can dip it's so good so tasty so yummy and look at that doesn't it just\nfeel like it's a whipped cloud of angel food cake and boiled I say YUM\nnow because of my lung issues I can't have candles in our house because well I\njust can't breathe and so instead of not having candles on my wife's birthday\ncake to celebrate her birthday and blow out the candle and make a wish\nwe actually have little reusable candles that are lit up\nwas a battery and so we put a little cup in the center of the cake and put in the\nlittle tea lights the electric tea light in there just seeing her happy birthday\nand then she made her way she just turned off the light instead of blowing\nall over the cake it's probably a good idea especially right now during the\npandemic and then it was time to cut into the angel food cake and eat it\nlook how spongy and light and fluffy it is it turned out so beautifully look at\nall those sprinkles inside and look how well that boiled icing held its form on\ntop it's like eating a bite of cloud but really sweet the lovely lights delicious\nyummy tasty cloud it's so good I highly recommend it although you might be\ntempted to eat the entire cake since it is so light and you feel like you\nhaven't eaten anything at all I don't recommend that all that sugar oh my\ngoodness now head on over here and I'll show you how to make the boiled icing or\nthe whipped meringue icing which is again it's like an Italian meringue\nicing only without butter so there's no butter no oil no fat of any kind in the\nicing no shortening and it's so easy to make if you avoid the mistakes that I'll\nshow you in this video here go check it out if you enjoyed this please share it\nwith a friend and don't forget to hit the like

southern cooking and delights and today I wanted to bring this easy recipe to you a strawberry shortcake using the angel food cake mix from Betty Crocker the ingredients that you're going to need is one pack of strawberry glaze some fresh strawberries some whipped topping and a box of angel food cake mix I have used a different angel food cake to try to fix this and it just didn't seem the same it wasn't very fluffy but the Betty Crocker seems really fluffy I'm telling you you have to try this this is really good so only thing you're gonna need for the angel food cake is you're going to need a cup and 1/4 a cup of water and that's it and so I'll bring you back once I get the mix put together and actually get it in the dish that I'm going to be baking it in okay I'm just going to show you how I cut up my strawberries I picked out some strawberries that were kind of at the end of the rope so I'm going to set those aside and just cut the tops off and if there's any bad spots or spots that I don't want to that look questionable that one looks rough so I won't use it at all this package had a lot of large ones in it so I was trying to prevent it from using the large ones that get the small ones so they don't go to waste they'll go back quicker and I've already washed them so you know there was several of them that were this big but I think I cut that one way to D yes I haven't look like they're just really dark but we will eat this probably I mean this will get this okay so now I'm going to just go and cut this up I'm not going to cut them too small I think I'm going to leave on like that and then away there that one's already pretty small so I'm not going to mess with it anymore okay I've got a bow here I'm just gonna put them in the bowl and I think I'm just gonna grab another one another B Quan out of this say it and put it in there too now all you're gonna do from here is you're gonna cut your strawberry the glaze in particular is what I'm talking about you're gonna cut it open and I usually cut mine open all the way across the top some people do the corner and you can certainly do the corner if you're not using the whole thing but I plan on using the whole thing because this is going to make a big oh I've got to show you the angel food cake that is it's actually been rising in the container I have not even put it in the cake the casserole dish yet but I better or it'll be on the counter I have to show it to you so I'm just rolling this down trying to get all of it out okay so from there you're just going to take this and mix it up with the strawberries and put it back in the refrigerator until they until your cake gets done and it needs to cool so before you can even put this on so after you get this done you get it mixed if you want put more strawberries in or some blueberries or something like that then you could do that too I don't have any on hand so let me show you this really quick before get bigger swell I didn't spray this pan with some nonstick oil but let me slide this over and show you how much it is completely full it's about to go over the top so he was definitely expanded just in this so I'm going to pour it in see how large this is going to swell like it's going to expand in the oven but I'm telling it it's so delicious and fluffy and it goes such a long ways meets a lot of people that's why I say it's a really good fresh kind of dessert to take to an outing I've actually fixed this for church get-togethers and get-togethers in general picnic whatever to do that one didn't mix ups good so I'll mix that right there all right but you get the gist see how much it maybe I should check and make sure everything got mixed up but see how it is very fluffy and I'm just kind of checking to make sure everything got mixed up before putting in the oven being that my mixture died yeah it's good to see how now I'm gonna flatten it out and it's certainly going to change even without me doing this it altered but that's fine you can fix the end even if it if it goes uneven which mine usually does in the oven I may bring you back and just show you what it looks like and show you just how much it expands but it does expand a lot so you may want to put something underneath you know like on top of a flat cookie sheet or something like that just in case it comes out I've never had to come out but just in case so I'll bring you back and show you maybe what it looks like in the oven and how much it's actually rising and then after that I'll bring you back when it's completely done and cooled off so you can see how to dress the top okay I wanted to bring back this cake that I have started at the Strawberry Shortcake and it has see how its raised some on the paint in the casserole dish it's raised just a little bit above it so it's not too bad it's been in there for about ten minutes on 350 okay this is about 15 minutes in to baking at 350 degrees in the oven and see it has its reason some in the the casserole dish I also have a meatloaf to the side as well and if you're interested in seeing that recipe it's also here on my channel and so you can check that out but I will bring you back when it is completely finished and cooled off okay this is what it looks like when it's finished I've had it in for like 25 minutes on 350 possibly even 30 minutes so it's browned on top and it's browned on the bottom I'm just letting it sit and Poole it's actually sitting on something else it's not sitting on the counter like it looks but I'm so now I'm going to let it completely cool off it's completely finished at this point and I'm just gonna take my whipped topping and pour some of it out some of it's still a little frozen okay we'll start with that which was about half of this 16-ounce container it feels like some of it's still a little bit frozen it's this by the way has cooled off at this point now if you were fixing this is a pretty big casserole dish so I did get the 16-ounce but if you wanted to fix a smaller version of this by all means you could and don't look just so delicious alright so I still have some left that's in here so at this point we're going to take our strawberries that has been cut and mixed up with the glaze and I'm just gonna start dropping some here and there without touching it you all right so that looks like that's about it so doesn't that look absolutely delicious it's absolutely beautiful very easy I'll turn on its side so see look at all that fluffing angel food cake anyway I hope you guys enjoy and I hope you enjoy this strawberry my version of strawberry shortcake until next time I'll see you guys in the next video you", "al6HqEf994M": "you're going to start off your pecan cinnamon angel food cake with just some

about to show you is going to give all you meaning to having your cake and eating it too this is the devotion nutrition 100% protein angel food cake we're going to be taking a double portion of egg whites today because we're making this cake extra big this is going to serve two to four people I'm taking two cups of egg whites and adding them to my food processor and I'm going to meringue these egg whites this means you're going to be blending in egg whites whipping them until they are sticky while your eggs are whipping into stiff peaks you're going to add two teaspoons of cream of tartar this is a key ingredient to making your cake stiff and floppy without adding extra any without adding any extra ingredients [Music] Wow that's perfect once your egg whites have slept up into a nice stiff meringue we're going to fold in two scoops of angel food cake protein you're going to some wrinkled it and then fold it gently don't fold it too aggressively or you're gonna break your egg whites up we wanted to keep the integrity of the stiff egg whites so the amazing part about this cake is not only are the calories and macronutrients outstanding but you can make this cake any flavor you desire by using any flex labor so today I'm going to be doing this combo we're going to be using six sticks for a double batch so I'm going to be using our golden butter and mixing it with our monkey bread to make a butter cinnamon flavored cake add your flex flavors to the cake and gently fold them in as well again not breaking not too forcefully because you don't want to break the egg whites up any combination of flavors will work or you can just do all one flavor if you just have a favorite flavor next we're going to take a bundt pan you can make these in little cupcake forms you can make them in low forms but this is my favorite way to present it I say now you're gonna spray your pan a little bit of nonstick baking spray just to coat it so that the cake loosened up very easily and you're gonna gently place your mixture right into the form you can't mess this cake up it's supposed to look fluffy and beautiful zero sugar very low in carbs and virtually no fat you really can't beat that I've already preheated my oven to 350 so I'm gonna put this in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes you'll see that it'll be nice some golden-brown while the cake is baking I'm going to make a chocolate buttercream icing for the top and once again this is all just protein so no sugars no extra carbs it's a perfect late night snack or perfect for if you're really dieting hard but you're crushing some serious cravings you're gonna just take our brownie batter I'm taking about a scoop and maybe 3/4 and I'm taking two sticks of our golden butter once again this is gonna add that buttery buttercream flavor that you usually taste when you eat a birthday cake but certainly won't have the satin calories of a real birthday cake now I'm just going to add a little bit of water and this is going to make the perfect icing for the top of this cake here is a perfect angel food cake as you can see their little brown peaks on the top it's firm to the touch and you're ready to flip it over and ice it all right here is the angel food cake and sometimes you want to give it a little bit of time to cool off maybe about 10 minutes it'll be perfect okay after your cake has cooled quite significantly because you don't want the icing to melt all over you're gonna take your icing and the cool thing about this cake is it doesn't have to be perfect it's going to be delicious no matter what and it's going to look just fine even if it's not perfect any Baker can do this you can obviously eat it just like that my kids prefer sprinkles and sometimes if I want to add some extra crunch to the key or a little bit of decoration for an occasion I will crush up some pecans some almonds sprinkle them right on the top the perfect knife to use to cut a cake like this is actually a bread knife so that you don't smash down this light fluffy cake and you just kind of slice through it just like so now this is why we say with devotion nutrition you can have your cake and definitely eat it

a black tea angel cake you'll need five medium sized eggs 25 grams of granulated sugar 30 milliliters of rice oil 80 grams of rice flour and another 60 grams of sugar for the meringue and lastly soak 1.5 grams of black tea leaves in 50 milliliters of soy milk clock all five eggs and put four egg yolks in a bowl and start mixing the other egg yolk you will not be needing but keep all the five egg whites after mixed thoroughly add 25 grams of granulated sugar mix all that until it's well combined after mixing you're gonna add 30 milliliters of rice oil and you're gonna mix it until it's all combined now that you've mixed your gonna add your so milk with the block tea leaves inside you're gonna add it when those TVs has been soaked in the soy milk for at least 15 minutes and over make sure you scrape everything out of the container now that you've poured all the black tea leaf soy milk into the mixture you are going to mix it until all the black tea leaves or evenly spreaded now we're going to add the rice flour we recommend using a strainer before we add it in just so that there will be no chunks in the rice flour the block tea flavored idea picnic is very good well you're going to make the meringue now you are going to take out the five egg whites from before and you're gonna mix it with electric mixer after it is all mixed in it is like a bubbly meringue you will add white sugar into it [Music] and into the meringue you're gonna slowly pour the sugar into the meringue you know that your meringue is ready when it's all creamy and whilst hold place and if you flip it 180 degrees it will not fall after you are done with your meringue that is the time to pre-heat your oven you can freeze your oven to 338 degree Fahrenheit or 170 degree Celsius you are going to break your meringue into thirds and add one third of the meringue into the egg yolk mixture you are going to slowly mix in the meringue into the egg yolk mixture and you are going to fold it in matte it on mixing you are going to add half of the meringue you have left into the bowl and like before you're going to slowly fold it in now you are gonna mix the rest of them around you have left now that all the meringue is mixed you are gonna add the batter into a 17 centimeter cake mold a trick to make it look good after it is baked is that not to put it on the side of the tray or the mold because after it is baked it becomes really messy so try to put it try to pour it from a high up and not put it on the sides all the cake butters now in a 17 centimeter cake mold you're gonna get a long object I am using a chopstick and we're gonna do circular motions in the cake and we're gonna hold on to the mold very tightly this is helping the cake balance out and it'll look prettier once it is all baked now that it is preheated put it in the oven for 37 minutes to bake it has been 37 minutes in the oven and it's time to take it out make sure you wear it well so you don't burn yourself it should look golden brown just like this take the cake out of the oven and flip it and put it on a cake holder this will help the cake rise and hold the shape and also make 30 minutes till it all cools down now that all the cake is cooled down with an angel cake knife you are gonna fully go around the game shi-wan knife edges I love you run around on the outside multiple times you are gonna get the angel 9 and put it in the inside of the cake now do that process multiple times so that the cake is eat it's easy to come out after using an angel knife you're gonna slowly put your fingers through the outside of the cake and try to slowly pop it out and you're gonna purge the top of the the bottom of the cake mold and you're gonna hold the middle of the ring of the cake and you--oh slowly close this is what it looks like after you take it out now you're gonna go under the cake and cut the metal part so the cake comes off from the ring you're gonna go inside of the cake and you're gonna go around holding the top of the cake mold and like the angel angel cake knife you're gonna do on the bottom hold it and put it in circles and then you're gonna put it upside down and you'll slowly come out now the cake is off the cake looks beautiful but the side is a little crumbly so you're gonna put your hands to the side and rub it nicely against it so that all the crumbs fall off doing this process will make the cake very smooth and delicate and it will also make the cake easy to cut because all the crumbs won't be on it this is what the finished product looks like this is what the final product looks like I hope the cake goes well for you guys please hit the like button subscribe turn on notifications bye", "XjBxa3XWMP4": "it was making us an angel food blueberry dream put on I wanted some matching yeah I love it I like your new mattress yes me too tramatic honor is Kimmy and Maria Maria's already things I've never thought about in the kitchen is to match my close kitchen you better match the eggplant parmesan all right we're gonna get started on this cake because it takes a second to get that's worth it yes over here we have whipped together well together rather some egg whites exactly so we're making an angel food cake today and the thing about angel food cakes is the only way that they are leavened the only way that they rise is through egg whites repeating them so what we have done guys is we have beaten our egg whites with some sugar and some cream of tartar and a little bit of vanilla and you want a really really stiff correct and that's what we've done what we're gonna do now is we're gonna we're gonna move this into this bowl because we're gonna add our flour and the same thing holds true for the flour when we added our sugar to these egg whites we added it slowly because that helps to bring the give the whites all their lift and when we the flour we're gonna add it slowly as well perfect yes please please and it's interesting we've already sifted this once along with sugar and a little bit of salt but we're gonna sift it twice and you really just fold correct want me to take over for a sec so we try to do it gently I like to turn the bowl how centered of down the middle yes what did you say do you recommend doing a metal bowl I'm sorry I did oh no no I mean you don't honestly if I'm doing it at home I might just keep it in in in the stand mixer but because what do we get on TV Rafi we're doing it this way perfect thank you spin I think yes you like this it's like down the middle around them like how you did that yeah very that's fancy right there is a technique there yes now guys what we're gonna do is we are going to add it to our angel food pan which is really fun check this out these are the legs of the pan the reason an angel food cake pan has legs is again after we take this out of the oven after its baked we are going to cool it on up side no joke beads you don't have an angel oh okay if you don't have an angel food pan you can use a a loaf pan but I highly recommend investing in one of these not not not terribly expensive and worth it alright so let's go in the oven put this into the oven for 35 to 40 minutes and one temperature at 350 and we pop it out when it's lightly browned on top and and we then immediately flip it over to cool erect however if you're if your angel food cake pan does not have feet correct jesse has a very cool way to watch this we're not gonna drink this watch this so what you do literally is put your cake honey I even I won't lie every time I do this I think it's gonna fall out it does it doesn't and what this does is because we've gotten all this rise in the cake if we just lay it on the bottom it'll be like me it can't be a fluffy angel exactly but here we have lost so we do this so after the cools we cut it look at this beauty guys and we frost it with our beautiful blueberry so this this recipe I love its you make a really oh you know oh you spoon you use you mate you'd make a really easy blueberry jam on the stovetop with blueberries and sugar in a little water and then after that cooks down and them and the blueberries get kind of jammy and loose you stick that in the fridge and it basically turns into like a compote or a jam but what is it what's the other stuff is though this inand once it's cooled you put it into whipped cream okay I'll just say don't you know while you're doing that and my gosh looking around here the vintage Baker it's filled with great modern recipes modern takes on vintage recipes right sure there you have the Mexican hot chocolate bavarian pie my goodness so that a bavarian pie is basically a pie that is made it sort of comes together with a little bit of gelatin i put a lot of Mexican thank you Betty I put a lot of Mexican hot chocolate spices in both the meringue and in the chocolate itself up we're onto the silver cake with pink frosting oh my absolute fave that's a white cake with pink frosting that I adore and then I would love to come and make with you sometime because I think because then I could wear pink that's right camera camera being sober all being pink okay so that's called the coconut blitz torte I love that cake it's coconut cake two layers they can put a coconut meringue on top of and then you literally bake the meringue and the cake together and pull it out and fill it with coconut whipped cream I know I'm just gonna say in the time it took you to take us on that little tour she's frosted yes I feel my skills are not quite what they should be but I'm an extract okay thank you a little mess life the beauty of this also guys the reason we have our parchment paper here thanks Tammy the reason we have our parchment paper is I can make a bit of a mess and then pull out the paper and it will be nice and smooth okay so here we go we want to see that oh yeah yeah and you can place a wine bottle if you wanted I think we should put the wine in our bellies oh and there you go look at this how's it look wait till you taste it recipe everybody you guys have a fight I'm gonna tell everyone the finance at a homeless Channel doctor", "R8_iZ3KoCG8": "hey everybody welcome back to my bake like a pro YouTube channel in today's really fun video I'm gonna show you how to make a mini angels food cake for my recipe today I am using 4 egg whites from large eggs this is equal to 137 grams 1/2 a cup of all-purpose flour this is equal to 75 grams 1/2 a cup of white granulated sugar this is equal to 100 grams 1/2 a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract this is equal to 2 grams 1/2 a teaspoon of cream of tartar this is equal to 1 gram and our last ingredient 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt and this is equal to less than 1 gram just that tiny bit of salt is needed for our recipe today so those are the ingredients so let's get started into a large very clean bowl I'm gonna add in all of my egg whites I'm just gonna use a little spatula to make sure I get everything out that's good to that I'm gonna add in the little bit of cream of tartar and cream of tartar is an acid and it will help stabilize the whites I'm gonna grab my mixer an important thing to note about your mixer make sure that the little beaters on your mixer are also washed well and wipe down you want to make sure that there is no grease on them and at this point I'm just going to start getting my egg whites to the throught the stage [Music] so just a medium speed we're just building up a little bit of volume [Music] you can see now they're getting frothy and go a little faster now [Music] slow my mixer down and I'll just get in my pure vanilla extract get that right in there [Music] and that's good like that so at this point I'm going to start adding in my white granulated sugar and this is going to add stability to our egg whites so I'm going to increase my speed and then just slowly start pouring the sugar in but now I'm going to put my mixer on high and continue to whip and that little bit of salt I'm just gonna add that in right now so this is about little maybe two minutes of mixing and you can see now look at the peaks that are happening and I'm happy with that so we'll just clean off our beater that's good and I do have my oven preset right now 325 degrees Fahrenheit and then we're gonna take our flour let's get all of that into the sieve and then just get it all over the top so it's very important that you have your oven going before this is finished you want to make sure that you're all ready to go so now I'm gonna grab a spatula we don't want to wait too long and we just want to start folding this in oh the Nilla smells amazing now we are gonna be using a mini bundt pan and one of the things with angel food cake do not grease your pan I'm gonna be using a pan that has a Teflon coating but if you're using a regular pan you can add a little bit of oil not too much the secret with these kind of cakes is that the egg grabs on to the side of the pan as it bakes so as it bakes it Rises and it grabs on to the inside of the pan if it's greased too much or at all it can actually slide down when you take it out of the oven so just make sure you just push it through go around you want to bring the bottom up over the top without it deflating it too much I want to make sure everything looks good so just bring it over itself you can see it's a nice batter that's good and I'm happy with that right away without any delay grab your little tin and I'm just going to start filling this and I'm gonna have a little bit left over that I could actually make a cupcake or two depending on how big the cupcakes are I'm gonna grab a little spatula I'm just gonna go over the top there's a little air pocket right there I just want to make sure I get that and that is good so I'm just gonna show you what this looks like so this here is a three cup model I'll put all of the information on here so this is equal to 750 milliliters by volume so at this point now I'm gonna go and place this into my oven I'm gonna bake it off and then I'll come back I have a little bit left here I'm gonna do probably one cupcake with this so here we go right out of the oven exactly 25 minutes at my 325 degrees Fahrenheit and I'm just gonna turn this over and this is how you let angel food cake rest and start to cool down I'm just gonna move that on there so you can see that so this is extremely hot and what we do now is we do not unmold it until it's completely cold so we're just gonna let that sit there until it's completely cooled down and then I'm gonna come back we're gonna top it and hopefully we're gonna lift it out we're gonna get a really nice cake and the reason why we leave this type of cake upside down like this while it cools is so that the cake does not condense it doesn't shrink and instead gravity keeps pulling it down so we'll just let that cool down and then I'll come back hey everybody so this is about an hour later and this is completely cool now oh that feels light oh-ho there we go look at that perfect you can see it really grabbed on there so that's good this here is a nonstick pan if you don't feel comfortable trying this then do grease your pan because I'd rather have you have you know results then the whole thing falling apart you know because it's stuck inside your little tin or tin little pan so there we have it look at that very nice they have to remember this looks very very unfinished usually this is going to be sliced up and then you're gonna put strawberries and ice cream on it so the actual look of this you know that's the way it looks it doesn't look you know super pretty like that but that's the way it is I'll just lift it up and show you and this is super super light look at this really nice so I do want to cut into this and show you what it looks like inside so to finish off our video I am gonna cut into the angel food cake in one second but I did want to show you the little cupcake that we made I'll just show you this look at this oh that is nice so it made the little cake and the extra little cupcake look at that while really nice I'll just take a little piece of course you're gonna have to do something with this special strawberries ice cream of course hmm really really good very very light in texture and it just melts in your mouth very nice you have to remember too this is fat-free very very nice for a fat-free cake so let's just cut into this they do want to show the inside of this cake so let's take a nice little slice right here I'm gonna lift it up you can see look at how nice and airy that cake is you can see all the little bubbles in there perfect so that's it for this really fast video I hope you enjoyed it if you did please give me a thumbs up subscribe if

welcome back well today we're going to assemble that lemon cake for my sister's birthday it's easy and the cake is delicious now before we go any further remember to subscribe okay come on let's go get started this lemon angel food cake in the freezer for a couple of days and now I'm ready to use it I'm going to unwrap it the easiest way to cut this is if you just take a few toothpicks and just mark a little guide so that you kind of keep it straight and place them halfway and as you're cutting it's going to make it a lot easier for you to get from one side to the other and keep it even put a few in add a few more now just take a serrated knife just start cutting taking the top off taking the toothpicks out all I'm going to do is spread a nice layer of lemon curd right inside and then put the top back on now I'm topping it with my lemon whipped cream if you put the cake on a plate that's raised I actually used a cake plate inverted upside down it's raised up then you can just take an offset spatula and just go all the way around and smooth out that whipped cream and do the same thing on the top now I'm going to just use that offset spatula and slide it right underneath the plastic and I've put another regular spatula on the other side and I'm going to use these tools to help me lift the cake off of the plastic so I can put it on the cake plate there it is that's my lemon curd angel food cake with lemon whipped cream topping served with extra lemon curd and fresh red raspberries give me a thumbs up if you got anything out of that video leave your questions and

come to the right place because today I'm making angel food cake it's light its Airy its fluffy it's everything that you could want in a desert and more and it only has six ingredients you do not need to buy a mix to make an angel food cake because it only has six ingredients to begin with what are you replacing the first thing that you want to do is separate 12 eggs British recipe you're gonna need 12 large egg whites that's something that you have to do that you don't have to do if you get a mix but don't get a mix okay you need the egg whites to be room temperature because they'll whip up better if they're room temperature but they're harder to separate in they're room temperature the yolks break more easily so choose yourself you want to beat your egg whites till they're foamy so transfer them to a stand mixer you can also do this by hand if you want but it'll take a little bit longer quite a bit longer maybe I don't know beat it until it's foamy when it gets foamy just add a teaspoon of cream of tartar that's gonna help give it nice structure and strength so that it'll get really nice when it's off to gradually add a cup and a quarter of sugar a little bit of the time and then step squat to keep and it's stiff glossy Peaks add two teaspoons of pure Manila you'll know it's stiff glossy Peaks when it'll hold its peak when you pick up the beater and hold it up in the air you don't want to go too much farther than that because then it'll start deteriorating stiff peaks transfer to another ball you want something wide and large it's much easier for folding and you won't lose as much volume that way oh this is so beautiful meringue is gorgeous and fun and actually not hard to make at all and it's always super impressive now what you want to do is sift in four additions one cup of cake flour and a quarter teaspoon of salt you do it in four additions and between each addition you fold it in that's why this big spatula is so useful you want a nice big strokes and you don't want to do too many from the key to any meringue based dessert is to not overwork it otherwise it'll break down your meringue mixture make sure that you're using cake flour and not all-purpose I don't usually use cake flour in my recipes because it's kind of a specialty item but it is very important in an angel food cake for the proper texture then what you want to do is transfer your mixture to an angel food cake pan with a removable bottom and has this tube and it lifts out not Greece not floured nothing just plain just dull up this around the center you want to smooth it out a little bit so it's nice and even you don't want to mess around with this too much but you do want to release some of the air bubbles if there are excess air bubbles so you run your spatula or a knife through the cake a couple times to settle everything down you can use your offset spatula or a butter knife for that Reese muth the top and then put it into a 350 degree oven until the top springs back when lightly touch 35 to 40 minutes when the cake comes out of the oven you'll notice that these two pans have these little feet what you want to do is let your cake cool upside down balancing on the feet that keeps the cake from falling as it's cooling it's actually a really cool thing old fashioned recipes used to tell you to put the tube over a bottle of wine you can do that too if you don't have the feet on your to pin all right now what you want to do is run your knife around the edges to release it from the sides of the pan I mean you should be able to lift it out so down cut across the bottom to remove it from the pan and then just lift it out beautiful light fluffy amazing and then I recommend using a serrated knife to cut it so that you don't wish it down too much with a regular knife plate it up with some berries and then eat it eat it immediately eat it for breakfast eat it for lunch either for dinner it's delicious and light and it's zero fat no you don't have to feel guilty about eating it unless you add that whipped cream because I do highly recommend adding a little ring but still trust your body treat yourself it's just like one light fluffy

"UrIZEjP_-6M": "[Music] today I'll surprise you with a traditional American soft and light cake made only with egg whites the angel food cake it's a true sweet cloud very difficult to resist but let's see together what ingredients we'll need two cups of egg whites that is the whites of about 12 extra-large eggs one big pinch of salt one and a quarter cups of sugar half a tablespoon of cream of tarter a leavening agent one eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla powder 1 and a fifth cups of flour let's make together the angel food cake first of all take the egg whites out of the fridge chip and keep it one temperature or if it's short of time bring them to 110 degrees in a bain-marie stirring with a whisk or without beating now it's time to beat the egg whites until stiff so use a planetary mixer or a common electric beater and let it run as soon as the egg whites turn white add the cream of tartar then the sugar and the vanilla 1/3 at a time [Music] to get this result beat the egg whites for 10-15 minutes at medium speed now add the sifted flour together with the salt stir gently to fold ingredients [Music] the angel food cake doesn't involve the use of fats that's why in the USA there is a special angel cake pan let it stall with a flat removable bottom but if you can find it just use a tube pen with at least a flat bottom in this case line with parchment paper and pour in the cake batter [Music] after putting the batter into the cake pan take a spatula or knife and cut gently through the better to remove any air bubbles then even out the batter and bake in a static oven at 350 degrees for about 40-50 minutes after such time let the angel food cake rest for 10 minutes inside the cake pan then take it out sprinkle with powdered sugar and why not since it's so light serve with sauces fruit or jam from Sony Angela de Ferran Oh bye and see you next video recipe [Music]", "7Of5qd42oKw": "we're making an angel food cake from a mix and it all it takes is one and a third cups water no eggs everything you need is in here which is one bag of the dry ingredients so pour in the contents which is just the powder and the water and mix it up they'll see it start to froth like this so after doing low speed for about 30 seconds do medium speed for only one minute it'll have some peaks in there and we're gonna pour it into an ungreased pan all right now this is a regular angel food cake pan it's important that you do not grease the pan okay and it must be thoroughly dry no oil or grease in any way you can see this is so light and airy now if you were making this from scratch I know my mother-in-law said it was her mother who made these from scratch with 12 egg whites and you had to blend with that blender until it got to those peaks the texture of those Peaks you were just seeing this was so simple with that box now we're done now we're making a topping for angel food cake out of some miscellaneous berries we had in the freezer we had about that many cranberries and about the same amount of these other berries and we're gonna make a syrup for the angel food cake right we're putting this into an oven that's been preheated to 350 and notice only the bottom rack is in because it needs to be as far from the heat as possible now we're adding in these other miscellaneous berries that we had with the cranberries were already in there with a little sugar in a little water we're gonna make it a mixed cranberry sauce so now this has cooked down and we're ready to pour it into another container so it can cool after its cooled Oswalt's ticket move bridge until we're ready for cake it's supposed to look very golden which this does we're just starting to smell it turn more golden and I immediately have to turn it upside down let it cool like that and once it's thoroughly cooled then you'll be able to unveil the cake all right so we're slicing through we have a serrated knife get through and there is a beautiful piece of angel food cake and here's some of the very topping that we made earlier and a little birthday sign that we've used for years to make it complete Oh", "rIW4UIWxpww": "hi I'm Christina and this is baking with chickens today I need to use up extra egg whites so we're making angel food cupcakes it's not what thing anymore oh I think I should I just keep whipping them I have egg white meringue pitaya powder soup I don't even know how to save this it's blow failed Bing meringue angel food wrinkly cupcakes I shouldn't put on my mouth all right so this entire project was a colossal fail I got my hair today's a bad day let's talk about failure for a minute failure is a part of life it's how we learn and failing is important most baking blogs or Instagram things that I see everybody really only posts you know the beautiful finished product and we don't really celebrate the big epic fail and I want to show you this fail because it's important because that's how we learn and we learn from our mistakes success feels really good but we don't learn as much from them so stay tuned at the end of this episode I'm going to show you a walk through step by step of exactly what went wrong and so that we can all learn why my angel food cupcakes failed and hopefully next time learned something new so celebrate those fails I'm calling it show me the ugly just like this little gal here this is butter berry and she doesn't look so hot because she gets picked on but we still love her just the same and her best friend misses her [Music] angel food cupcakes are light as air and there's no fat so typically when you make a cake there's butter or egg yolks that are fat that help you make the cake so angel food cake is just egg whites and cake flour and some water to help it rise so we'll see what happens the first step in the recipe is to pulse the sugar to get it superfine you need superfine sugar because when you whip it into the egg whites it has to suspend and not cut through and take out all of that air so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put it in the food processor and pulse it all right when it's superfine we're going to add our cake flour and salt so I did not have any cake flour I only had all-purpose flour so we can do a substitute and add in a little bit of cornstarch to make cake flour the reason why you want superfine cake flour instead of all-purpose is because if you use all-purpose in this really light angel food cake the cake will be too dense so what I did was I took out a little bit of the flour and I've added in a little bit of cornstarch so if you're wondering what the proportions are it depends on how much you have so do a quick google and find out what it is I have half a cup of flour so I did a half tablespoon of cornstarch so the next step is to add in my cake flour mixture into the sugar and the food processor add some salt and then pulse it until it's aerated and for so we'll set this aside now we're gonna whip our egg whites into a nice fluffy meringue so I have my egg whites here that were left over I used these previously to make the banana pudding and now I have all these egg whites that need to be used up I'm gonna add this cream of tartar to it what this does is it helps stabilize to keep it nice and fluffy and not fall looking pretty good let's check again we don't want to over whip because as soon as we over whip it there's no going back now we're gonna want to sift in our flour and sugar mixture so sifting it means you just want to do a little bit at a time I'm gonna use this little basket to sift it in add a little bit at a time not all of it the secret to angel food cake is to keep it really light so now we're gonna add it our cupcake liners [Music] [Music] we're making meringue icing to go with our angel food cupcakes so if you take a closer look at these angel food cupcakes they're kind of deflated and wrinkly so angel food cupcakes fail but you know what they still taste really good and there's nothing that icing can't fix so we're gonna make some meringue icing which is basically like a marshmallow fluff to go on top and I'll talk about why these failed later so the first thing we're gonna do is boil some sugar water and whip up our egg whites so I have some egg whites in here and vanilla and we're gonna whip these into a meringue and then we're gonna drizzle some hot sugar in there [Music] these are soft peaks I'm gonna give it a little bit more it's looking closer to step lost Peaks I'm gonna add in my pinch of salt and to give this a little bit of coat you don't have to give this color I mean it's just basically gonna be like a marshmallow but I thought it'd be fun to make these pink so I have this really cool pink a Pattaya super food coloring so it's just powder so this is basically powdered freeze-dried dragon fruit and I got it on Amazon this is from Suncor foods they're pretty awesome they make all different colors and if you want to do natural colored food dyes these are a great way to do it without using like the gel food coloring switch or artificial flavors so if you take a look inside it's this really cool powder so we're gonna put some spoonfuls in and it's going to make it a nice pretty pink [Music] hmm I don't know if this is gonna work it's not what thing anymore can i over whip meringue oh I think I it up now what well still should I just keep whipping them I can't tell if this is over baked beaten or I added stuff too soon or what it doesn't look like it's like whipping anymore I think it's toast damn let's take a step back and analyze why this whole thing failed so the meringue failed I think a couple things so if you take a look at this closely you'll see a couple things here so this is my meringue and it's watery so it was making soft stiff peaks before I added the powder now ideally you should be able to add it and maybe I added it too early it should have been I added it when it was at soft peaks and I should have waited till it got to stiff peaks so one possibility why this failed is I added this too early and it changed a chemical makeup maybe the sugar could have been wrong if you see like this is like super heart this is hardball crack sugar um Wow I shouldn't put that enough yeah I've stuck to my tooth um so I don't even know if the sugar incorporated into this properly I don't even know what to do with this now but I have egg white meringue pitaya powder soup instead of this beautiful marshmallow fluff frosting that I wanted so I don't even know how to save this if you've over beaten meringue you can sometimes save it by adding in a fresh egg white but I don't even know what to do with this maybe we can bake it and come up with some crunchy cookie like thing we'll try that who knows at least we'll learn something okay so now let's move on to the cupcakes and let's talk about why these maybe fails so angel food cakes are really particular because they are only using the egg white and the steam in the water to make it fluffy so there's nothing else there's no leavening agent there's no baking powder or anything to make it fluffy so you see mine in the wrinkly and deflated there could be a couple reasons one reason could be because I didn't sift if you didn't sift your flour into the egg whites when you folded it that means maybe why but you saw that we did sift it so maybe I didn't fold it properly or fold it good enough or we deflated it somehow the second reason that this maybe failed was I maybe used the wrong type of sugars so in Sally's recipe she said use superfine granulated sugar so you can get super fun by getting baking sugar um you saw I put it in the food processor to make it super fine but I used organic cane sugar that maybe had an effect on it I didn't use baking sugar I was lazy I had a bag and I decided to use the bag I already had open just regular granulated sugar so it's the sugar granules aren't small enough and they aren't light and fine they're too big and so then when you mix them in with the egg whites that cuts out the air so that's also maybe why it was so ugly and then you'll see my little cakes here have little nipple dimples because I didn't do a good job smoothing them over but you know they taste pretty good still so let's open one up since these are all destroyed anyways so yeah see you seek out they're kind of lumpy and it's sticky it's not so bad on the inside it's still good I mean it's just a fun part of baking I mean this was a total fail but I'm still gonna eat it and I'm sure my friends are still gonna eat it they don't care that it's ugly so let's bake these in soot they turn into anything it's raining today I was gonna make macarons with the egg white and it's raining and it's too humid so I decided to make these instead in this today just didn't work out it's okay till next time hopefully something better and you got in your hair then I got  in my hair", "24jCb9eF0bs": "good morning everyone share here with you welcome to my channel so today I just want to share a really quick awesome yummy recipe with you I've made this recipe many times before it's called a angel food tunnel cake I'm actually going to be heading off to a staff meeting here very shortly and I volunteered to make it the dessert today and this is just such a quick easy thing to put whip together and it's really really super yummy and for any of you that are kind of watching your waistline it's also a really good dessert for that because as you know angel food cake has very little calories and fat in it so it's one of those kind of guilt-free kind of desserts that you can enjoy and not feel bad about it after so I'm just gonna don't jump in and show you how I put this together so I'm just gonna quickly go over the items that you're gonna need for this dessert so obviously you're going to need a prepared angel food cake so I actually baked this last night and it came out nice and light and fluffy and you'll notice that I've got it in my handy dandy Dollar Tree cake carrier this is going to come in handy today and yeah I've used this many times already what a great buy from Dollar Tree I love that thing you're also going to need some cool hwhip now you could also use whipping cream if you wanted to and I'm using to try to keep this as locale as I can I'm using the light today and I've had this in the fridge overnight so it's not frozen anymore it's all thought out you're gonna need some pudding or something you could also use yogurt you could use cream cheese you could use it a lot of different things for this but I like to just use just plain old simple vanilla packaged pudding and then you're also going to need for this particular one that I'm gonna do today I'm using crushed pineapple now I've already drained this and I actually have it in a sieve and I've kind of squeezed all the liquid out if you're gonna be using any kind of canned fruit you want to make sure that you really get as much of the liquid out as possible because you don't want your cake to get soggy so like I said I'm using pineapple today you could use fresh fruit of any kind you could use pecan peaches you could use canned apricots I mean the sky's the limit with this recipe that's what I love about it is it's very versatile and just basically use whatever you like or whatever you happen to have on them so the first thing you want to do is you want to cut the top part off and you're gonna leave this is gonna be your lid so you want to leave I don't know about an inch or so and it's used to do this with a nice sort of sharp serrated knife so I'm just gonna go ahead and I'm going to just carefully cut the top of my cake off here and just be careful as you go around I find that the serrated knife works much better if you just kind of use kind of like a seesaw motion here you will have no problems getting through this and as also if you kind of chill your cake ahead of time I've had this a fridge overnight so makes it a little easier as well so that's about as thick as I've made it there so I'm just gonna take this piece off set that aside on a plate and now I'm gonna show you how to actually make the top so again with a nice sharp knife I'm just using like a steak knife here and it's also serrated so I just find if you have a serrated knife it works better so what you want to do is you're gonna actually cut two circles you're going to cut a circle about a half an inch from the outside and you're gonna cut a circle about a half an inch from the inside but you don't want to cut all the way down to the bottom of the cake you want to leave probably about a half an inch or so so I'm going to start let's start on the inside here so I'm gonna cut start cutting and again just use that kind of up-and-down seesaw motion as you go around you want to make sure you're leaving enough cake on the inside so that your filling will stay in place so you just make your little cut so I've gone all the way around I don't know if you'll be able to see this very well but I've gone all the way around on the inside and I'm gonna do the same thing on the outside again leaving a good I don't know half inch to an inch amount of cake on the outside so that you'll have a good wall here so your feeling won't spill out but just keep going all the way around almost there see how this serrated knife works really well you just kind of just keep bringing it up and down there so I've gone all the way around on the outside now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna grab a bowl and you're gonna literally just pull this middle section the cake just pull it right out you don't have to be too fussy with this just pull it out and actually you want to leave a little bit on the bottom so that your filling has something to sit on and just keep pulling and you don't you're not don't worry you're not gonna waste this cake here this is actually gonna be part of our filling there so I'll show you what this looks like now so I've got it hollowed out just like that so I've got a nice base here for my filling to sit in and I've got a nice wall on either side so that my feeling won't spill out so now the next step is to actually make the filling so this extra cake that I pulled out I'm gonna just use my hands and I'm just gonna pull it into little bite-sized pieces you could cut it with a knife if you want but I'm not gonna get too fussy with this I'm just gonna kind of break it apart with my fingers now that I've got that all pulled apart nice little pieces I'm gonna go ahead and put it probably a couple containers of this pudding vanilla pudding you could use butterscotch and I mean you could use whatever flavor you really would prefer but I'm gonna go ahead and just put vanilla in here it's just gonna kind of help everything together so the last thing I'm gonna add is my crushed pineapple like I said I've had to drain this really well and I took a spoon and I actually pushed all the free kind of down to the bottom of the sieve so I could really squeeze out the last little bit of moisture out of there so I'll just add my crushed pineapple in here and I'll just mix this all together and this is how simple this is oh my goodness it smells really good too and I think that's going to be plenty wet enough I don't think I need any more pudding in there you could also add a little bit if you had extra whipping cream or extra Cool Whip which I'd you know I think these containers seem to get smaller and smaller every time I buy these so I don't really want to add any inside this filling because I think I'm gonna need all of this to ice the outside of my cake so but you should you definitely could put a little bit of cool whip or whatever in here just to make it a little bit more you know tastier but there we go so that's my filling so now all I have to do is just put the filling inside the little tunnel that we made here it really couldn't be any easier than this you just spoon it right in there [Music] okay so there you have it that's all filled up now I'm gonna go ahead and put the top piece back on and then all that's left for us to do is just ice it with the cool whip so I want to make sure I get everything covered really well so I'm actually going to start in here in the middle and I usually just take the back end of my spoon like this and I find this is the easiest way to get inside here and try not to get a bunch of crumbs sometimes that's hard though especially with an age of the cake it can be kind of crummy and the great thing about this cake too is it doesn't have to be perfect there we go and then once I kind of get that part done then I just basically spin some of this right on top you could get fancy and you could put some of this in a piping bag and you could you know pipe some rosettes or whatever on here as well but for today I'm just in a bit of a hurry so I'm not gonna get too fussy with this I just kind of want to get this covered and you could also what I've done in the past is I've actually taken some of that fancy coconut that you get you know the long fancy coconut and I've put it on a cookie sheet and put it under the broiler and toasted it just a little bit just ever so slightly just to kind of get it just barely Brown and then sprinkle that on afterwards and it looks really good and it pairs really well the coconut pairs really well with the pineapple and that's really good as well then you really don't have to worry so much about what your icing job looks like cuz the coconut kind of covers it all out but I know there's a couple of ladies in my office that don't they're not real huge coconut fans so I am NOT going to do the coke thing today but because I have done that many times and it's really good you just have to really watch when you're boiling the coconut that you don't burn it because it burns very very easily so you can see how quick this cake is coming together especially if you bake the cake the night before I sing it and putting it together is so quick and easy so you could use whipping cream but that would kind of defeat the purpose of trying to keep this locale and low fat but I mean by all means use whatever you want so I'm just gonna keep icing this and when I've got it all done I will show you the final product so there is my iced angel food town cake all ready to go to my staff meeting all I need to do is just put my little cover on here and I'm hoping this is gonna fit without wrecking my job here let's see oh my gosh look at that it fits perfectly I will have I will give you one little tip with these little carrying cases though even though you know they seem like they're locked into place and I just would hate to trust it I always carry it from the bottom and not from just the handle here because yeah you would wouldn't want to have a little accident with your all your hard work here but you've seen how easy that came together I think I've whipped this up in like 15 minutes or less like that was so easy and simple and this really is so yummy and everyone's gonna love it I'm sure so I hope this has inspired you guys to try to make your own tunnel cake likes to experiment with different flavors different fillings different you could put different things on the outside you could put some sprinkles or coconut or whatever nots would be really good too but I'm just kept it very simple today just because I was in a bit of a time crunch and I wanted to keep it as simple as possible and it's low-cal as possible as well so hope you guys enjoyed it and hope you guys give this recipe a whirl alright till next time I'll catch you again bye for now everyone", "hAJLivEO__w": "[Music] [Applause] do [Music] are y'all ready to get started making this delicious angel food cake hey y'all it's tammy with collard valley cooks and today we're making one of my very favorite things an angel food cake they're so light and fluffy this is in our second cookbook and we'll be having it with some fresh strawberries the first thing you're going to do is crack a lot of eggs because you're going to need one and a half cups of egg whites so you're just going to separate them out well you can really tell which egg is cool and which eggs were still it have been at room temperature for a while these are large eggs so we're going to see about how many it takes to get that much egg white okay that took about 13 eggs so use large eggs it's going to take around 12 to 13 eggs to get the whole full one and a half cups of egg whites and we'll have to do something of course with the yellows as well but not for this cake you can use the yellows in a sponge cake um now here's our white and this this is when you're going to sift your flour and your powdered sugar together all right you're going to be using a cup of flour and one and a half cups of powdered sugar so i'm gonna put the cup of flour in here and then we're gonna be using one and one half cups of powdered sugar i hope i've got that much in here if i don't i'll go get some more but i have some left in this bag i have found the best way to keep powdered sugar is in a bag same way with brown sugar for some reason if i put um them and try i try to put them in something they always wind up getting lumpy my powdered sugar does all right there's one and then we're gonna add another half cup to that [Music] i could probably get it in the scepter let's get these out of our way and now you're just going to sift that powdered sugar together with the flour and put it in a bowl you need to do that in a separate bowl my mama used to make these cakes a good bit when i was young because they're low in fat and um matter of fact i don't have any oil in them okay i was using the pioneer woman sifter that someone had sent me and it was taking so long to get it sifted so i grabbed my old faithful out of the cabinet and poi what a difference it makes now that's a scepter the sifter metal pieces have to go right up against the strainer for it to uh sift it good i always take my hand and smash what's left in the bottom through the strainer too but boy um does it make a difference so whenever you get one see how that scrubs the bottom and then i'll show you this one see it's not scrubbing the bottom so if you pick one up in a store and you buy it do that and if it's not scrubbing the bottom don't buy it all right it's time to make the meringue i'm gonna grab um a teaspoon and a quarter teaspoon and we're going to start our meringue now we're going to be beating this on the high speed and it's going to be loud so i'm just going to go ahead and tell you what's going in we're going to be adding the one and one half cups of egg whites and i'm going to go ahead and put my extracts in so we're going to put in a teaspoon of vanilla a teaspoon of almond and of course you can substitute the almond if you don't like it to taste like almond but i love it we're going to be using one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar once it gets to going in the mixer and a whole cup of sugar and a dash of salt so i'm going to go ahead and throw in the dash of salt and we're going to start this up we're going to gradually add our sugar as our egg whites beat and we're going to beat them until stiff peaks form okay what that means is when you take a spatula and you do like this off the top the peak should actually go to the top tip and not curl over but actually be stiff enough to stand up okay so we're going to turn it on and start our mixer up getting these delicious egg whites be together [Music] [Music] so all right we're going to get these out of here show your spatula see how it's standing up on my spatula so we're going to start mixing up this cake what you do is um you mix these whites in with your flour and you fold them in together and then you bake it and there's no need to grease the pan you don't grease your pan you just run a knife around the edge of it when you get it out mine doesn't have feet if you buy one of these i think the one on my side actually has little legs on it you want one that has legs on it um if i had to do over again of course i'd buy one like that because when it gets done you're going to flip it upside down and those legs keep it from rested on the counter i actually have to prop mine on something because i don't have one with legs all right but it's a good pan so i'm not gonna get rid of it just because of that now what we're gonna do is we're gonna add about a third of this at a time so you're gonna do this about three times you're gonna be putting about a third of the egg whites in your bowl with about a cup or so of your flour sugar and you're going to fold it together this time i'm going to try to stay on the left side of the pan because that first bunch is over there on the right hand side and try to get the flour and sugar in this and not what i've already got flour and sugar in makes a lot of pretty egg whites don't it it smells so good too with that almond extract in it and if you don't want the almond extract you can always just use two teaspoons of vanilla a little bit more a lot of people think it's really hard to make an angel food cake and it's really not you just have to fold it together and take your time and you don't use a mixer to do it you just fold it with the spatula or large spoon until you get it mixed together good that should do it you don't want to over mix it that's perfect so now we're going to take our pan and this pan is two comes in two pieces and that's what you want you don't use a regular bundt pan because when you take this out you gotta be able to get the cake out of it and i'll show you how to do that when we're taking the cake out but make sure you use a fluted pan two pieces you don't grease it or anything so now you're just going to put your batter and your pan all right we're going to get it in the oven and we're going to bake this at 375 degrees for 40 minutes all right we're going to bake this at 375 degrees for 40 minutes it's going to be delicious when it comes out of the oven and it's going to have to cool down okay we're going to get this out of the oven and we're going to flip it upside down to cool see the pretty cake and we're going to flip it upside down and if you had feet it would hold it up off the top of the counter but i don't have little feet on mine so i'm going to have to flip it over like this on top of this um i think i'll just leave these under it like this and we're going to let that cool all right we've got about two and a half cups of strawberries out of that and i'm gonna put about a half cup of sugar in them maybe not the whole half cup that'll be plenty because they're pretty sweet escort how sweet your strawberries are as to how much sugar you're going to put in them and now we're just going to put this in the microwave and we're going to microwave these for about three minutes spread them out and something to cool this is cool completely so once it's completely cooled down you're going to take a knife a flat knife and you're going to go around the edge of the cake in the pan to loosen it from the edge then you should be able to lift it right out of the cake plate or the cake pan and now you're going to take your knife and you're going to go around the bottom and that way it'll come up off the pan off the bottom i got a little bit brown didn't i oh i'm messing up the top doing that and then go around the middle a little and lift it out and put it on your cake pan your cake plate ah some of it broke up all right we're gonna cut us a piece of cake and i am going to try and keep it from breaking all the pieces on the top because i kind of let it get messed up when i cut it i just kind of kept my finger on the top because this wants to break up it's real delicate on the top so you can put whipping cream don't that look delicious yummy yum all right we're going to try it get some whipping cream nothing like fresh angel food cake it's so light and delicious and fresh what's good go make you an angel food cake especially those of y'all out there with a bunch of chickens y'all have a great day and thanks for watching collard valley cooks where we cook like mama did bye y'all love ya [Music] [Music] you", "UiVpSoPxfvw": "hi everybody welcome back to my channel lori kendall lover gonna do another goose creek candle review and this time we're gonna do pumpkin angel food cake one of the new ones that i just got so the scent notes in this one are angel food cake pumpkin butter fluffy vanilla cake light spice vanilla bean shaved pumpkin so i do get a little bit of like a pumpkin fruitiness it's very mild it's not a specific type of fruit scent or sweet scent it's just a little bit of a background note which could be the shaved pumpkin maybe slightly sweeter than a straight pumpkin i do get vanilla cake pumpkin butter sure vanilla bean um yeah i mean it's like a vanilla-ish cake with a little bit of pumpkin or something added in to give it a hint of something else i know the original angel food cake has pear in it i don't necessarily get pear in this one um like that one but it is very similar i don't get a bunch of spice so far i don't get a lot of pumpkin-ness just a nice sweet vanilla cakey type [Music] angel food cake scent it's nice it's not super strong so far maybe it's like seven and a half so far um but i know a lot of other people have said something similar so i don't know if it's gonna get much stronger than that um but it's very nice with this being a 24 ounce two wick pear fin jar um i usually get a little bit stronger throw from the paraffins but every now and then you get a little bit more mild one which i think is okay because a lot of people don't like scents that are like totally in your face but they still want to get the 24 ounce jar and get a little bit more candle for their for their money but um this one's not a super super duper strong one but it is nice it's festive um it's got a nice uh orange color uh and it's pretty um it's uh just kind of a basic label it just has a picture of an angel food cake on it doesn't have anything else that's really depicts kind of a fall theme but it's orange so um yeah this is a nice one it's just mild and but it's a nice warm buttery angel food cake scent and if you like those more vanilla-ish cake scents you probably really like this one so anyway i hope this is helpful to you please like and subscribe if you haven't already and um hope you guys are having a great sabbath day and we'll see you guys again really soon for some more um reviews and i have some really good ones coming up like the spiderweb pancakes awesome throw on cold so i'm hoping that one really um really has a great burn and i'm also going to be doing um apple cheese cupcake cheesecake cupcake uh that i've had for a few days so yep we're gonna get these going and get you guys some more ideas especially before the next sale comes out so we'll see you later bye", "1iyFdJvJsqc": "today we're going to make a lemon cake and I bought this pan at a thrift shop for a buck and a half and it's a pan so has a tube in the middle and we're making an angel food cake it's a well the recipe is from this book I have called the Midwestern table the new Midwestern table it calls for Meyer lemons I only have regular lemons which you can substitute a dozen egg whites so I've got those here and my sugar so let's get started as I said I'm using a recipe by Amy Thielen but you could use any angel food recipe there's plenty of them out there the main thing is to follow the directions with the and they have the proper pan so you need a 2 pan and you need to just follow the directions so that you get a nice fluffy cake so this recipe has lots of lemon in it both peel and juice and that helps give it flavor it even also has 3 extracts it has lemon extract vanilla extract and almond extract so I think because angel food cakes are low fat they don't have butter in them the flavoring is really important and what sets it apart from the standard store-bought angel food cake so I'm preheating my oven and now you we need to whip up the egg whites got to make sure you don't get any yolk in your egg whites and also just use a very clean bowl so that you don't want any oil or a like dairy or any kind of recipe do excuse me residue on the sides of your bulb because you want the egg whites to actually cling to the sides of the bowl as its whipping in fact a lot of professionals use copper bowls just for whipping egg whites because they react with the egg whites to make them even fluffier [Music] so now I'm just adding this sugar that I had ground in a blender because it's supposed to be superfine sugar you're also supposed to use a cake flour which has been sifted three times I only sifted mine once so my final product probably would have been even an inch or so higher if I had been a little more picky and doing things the right way but there's my cake flour and I it's interesting I just used my sieve to sift it since I didn't have a regular sifter and the salt was superfine and it didn't go through here so it's a pretty good sifter you can see my pink sea salt at the end it won't go through so I just threw it on top all right and then also this stirring is very important you don't stir you fold and that's so you don't just deflate all the whites that you just beat the air into here's the three extracts I was telling you about and I tried to get all natural ones I don't like the imitations but either one will do alright I have to admit this cake gave me such a natural high making it just seeing all those fluffy whites it was a real tactile experiment experience I should say I felt like I was playing with shaving cream especially this part here I'm not even going to do the whole thing in fast motion because it's just to me so enthralling I could seriously do this all day gotta get it into those corners you also actually want it to stick to the sides and you don't grease the pan because that'll help it climb as the air heats and then you turn it upside down that's why it's got those little things on the ends there's the end product it was so good I hope you try one it's low-fat and delicious [Music]", "nAr8WnWQcFE": "hello friends this is Amanda from all the new mountain homestead to begin you need 12 egg whites about a cup and a half we'll begin at medium speed to get the egg whites nice and frothy once that happens we're going to add two teaspoons cream of tartar powder and this helps to stabilize your egg whites during the baking process [Music] now I'm increasing the speed to a medium high we're looking for a soft peak which means when you lift the whisk out of your bowl the peaks aren't really gonna hold they're just gonna kind of fall back down into the bowl but I also recommend scraping the sides of your hole between each addition to make sure nothing is sticking into the side of the bowl everything gets incorporated evenly [Music] now I am showing this process up close and personal because I know for people who are new to baking it's better to see what you need to be looking for than to just hear it at least that's how I learned better so now that we have reached a soft peak stage we're going to start adding in the fine sugar now granulated sugar is fine to use or you quick throw it in your blender or ninja and pulse it you know a few times just to kinda break up the granules and make it a little more of a fine sugar and here you can see again the soft peaks that have now formed and I'm going to continue whisking now we want to get this to a stiff peak and when you're looking for a stiff peak when you raise your whisk out of the bowl you're gonna see that the peaks that forms will stay in this place and it won't move and that's exactly what you're looking for when you're looking for a stick and I'll be showing that to you here in just a moment [Music] so now we're gonna add the vanilla and the almond extract and this slightly affects the stiff key so I advise just mixing it some more scrape your bowl and then whisk it another minute or so just to make sure that you've got these stiff peaks really well done because this is exactly what prevent this is what prevents your batter from leaking through the pain make a flour substitute which means you take 1 cup of all-purpose flour take out 2 tablespoons of the flour and replace it with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and you're gonna want to sift this a few times to make sure that all the lumps and your adding air to the flour so while you're mixing it into your egg whites and you're folding that flour in you are looking for a lumpy type better but you don't want to overmix because then you are taking up too many of the air bubbles and then it won't cook and you'll just end up with a more dense angel food cake [Music] [Music] now we're going to spoon the batter into an ungreased angel food cake pan which means the center part comes apart from the outside part you could also cook these in a cupcake pan with liners and if you don't have one of these pans and now we're just going to smooth it out so now I am cleaning up around the edges of the pan and smoothing everything out and getting it ready to go in the oven and now we bake it at 350 for 30 to 40 minutes or until it reaches a beautiful dark golden brown color [Music] by turning the pan upside down during the cooling process prevents the cake from falling and sinking all right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] strawberries like [Music] blender [Music] [Music] [Music] appreciate [Music] [Music] this is Martha Stewart's recipe and I didn't have to make one substitution instead of regular flour or cake flour we had to do a substitution where you take a cup of flour take two tablespoons out and then you add in two tablespoons cornstarch [Music]", "LFp83mXZq-M": "that looks pretty good so it's 12 full slices of cake they're not ginormous but I'm super excited to eat them what's up guys Kelly Walcheren today I'm back with another tasty dessert recipe today I will be making this guy it is a cannoli angel food cake no but a yeah cannoli angel food she kick so I like angel food cake I like cannoli I don't think I've had a cannoli in at least two years so pretty excited to make this let's go ahead and get started [Music] okay so the first thing we have to do is whip up some egg whites with salt and cream of tartar so the reason angel food cake is so white is because it actually it does not use any egg yolks at all [Music] next we're going to add in some cinnamon and some sugar gradually [Music] the next step is to put the cake batter into the prepared baking sheet and we try to use a 13 by 18 rimmed baking sheet [Music] we are going to take this and put it in the oven there we go okay my cakes been in the oven for about 20 minutes and I'm gonna give it a quick check substantial now [Music] we are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so I'm supposed to let it chill for an hour so I'm gonna go ahead and put it in fridge and then I'm gonna go children hour [Music] it's pretty good [Music] false license a hug angel food okay okay so I have my 12 cake slices here and we need the first one and give it a taste test and then the rest of mom faster [Music] first one Oh [Music] to try this [Music] so the frosting is amazing yeah the cream cheese ricotta pop sanguine the orange zest is so good [Music] that combination and Eugene's is delicious [Music] they sling out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I think of a normal-size stop yeah it's really tasty rather [Music] but [Music] done yeah [Music] I was really tasty I feel like that we're just so hard on it I don't want to just lay stuff in my mouth and not enjoy it so I'm

Lady cakes today we are making angel food cake mostly because I'm an angel so ok this cake is so good for you it's actually a hundred and sixty-one calories twelve per serving and if you're watching your sugar 37 grams of sugar but typically you'll see angel food cake in a bundt pan but today I'm making it in just a nine inch pan because I'm going to make it like a cake and layer it up with strawberries whipped cream in the middle so first off to start our angel food cake is we take our sugar and we sift very important in angel food cake you want it light and fluffy no crunches Oh Oh there's a clump that's why we sift and then divide it in half then we take our cake flour sift that as well and the salt and now we're gonna take our sifted cake flour and sugar and set it aside so now we have egg whites we need 12 egg whites or I'm using liquid egg whites which equal to 1 and 1/2 cup and with our wire whisk or whisk in it then take your nonstick cooking spray and spray down either your butt pan or today I'm using a 9-inch round I added a parchment paper in there as well so when it plops out it'll fall right on out so let's go put our angel food cake mix right on then you just want to bake this at 350 degrees 35 minutes and you'll have some heavenly angel food cake so now that our heavenly angel food cake has completely cooled this is the best time to eat it or you can top it off with some fresh whipped cream which I just like to make my homemade whipped cream you just take whipping cream and whip it up either with your KitchenAid blender or your hand mixer and then cut some nice little strawberries on top and it is the most light and decadent heavenly angel food cake thanks for watching this episode and I'll see you guys next time hi guys this week's tick-tock last week I asked you guys a question and it was what are you green or making for your Thanksgiving meals with your family and friends and this is what you guys said to faces in a joking said that they want to bring cookies fudge cinnamon rolls nice brownies and tiramisu young and common gal 89 said caramelized onion stuffing delish and this sounds delicious from Rin - they want to bring cheesecake with baked apple raisin topping and an old milk crust all right guys question for this week I want to know what kind of sweet yummy treats that you guys eating solid a season", "5cXMjLs09BY": "hi everyone welcome to shell sugar rush welcome back if you've been with me before today we're going to be making this fantastic light and fluffy spongy dessert angel food cake so let's get started [Applause] [Music] okay so for our angel food cake you're going to need one and three quarter cups of granulated sugar you're going to need one cup plus two tablespoons of cake flour and i also have a half teaspoon of salt in here as well you'll need 12 large egg whites and you're going to need one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar as well as one and a half teaspoons of vanilla okay and i have of course i'll be doing this in my bundt pan since angel food cake so i've got a bundt pan ready and some utensils will need and then i've got a mixing bowl uh where we'll whip up our eggs to start with and then a metal sieve as well for our dry ingredients once we add that in i'll be using my hand mixer with the whisk attachment and i'm excited today to be using my new ninja professional um i got this for christmas just because it was half off black friday but it's actually three in one because i've got the individual cups for uh blending and then the of course the mixer and the food processor so anyway uh so let's uh put it together here so first we're going to uh take our sugar and add it to our food processor because this this is a very finicky cake so you're going to want your ingredients to be as fine as possible so okay so we're just going to pulse this sugar a few times [Music] so i say just about 10 pulses is probably fine okay so now what we're going to do is take carefully take we're gonna take one cup back out and reserve it okay and we're gonna leave the rest in there and to the rest we're gonna add our cake flour which has our salt included okay okay and we're just going to pulse this a few times to again get it kind of light and a little aerated there okay now we're just gonna sit this to the side and we're gonna whip up our egg whites okay and we'll put our egg whites into our bowl and we're going to use our hand mixer with our whisk attachment again and we are going to go ahead as well and add in our cream of tartar okay one and a half teaspoons cream of tartar and we're gonna whip these eggs up until they start to get good and foamy uh about one minute okay now we're going to put it on medium high and slowly add our granulated sugar okay and we're going to actually whip this with the granulated sugar till we get um you know soft peaks and that's going to be about about five to six minutes okay let's see where we are no stop no soft peaks yet i'm getting close i'm going to go ahead and add in our vanilla and get that taken care of so i don't forget and we're going to just keep keep whipping until you get to those soft peaks like i said it is going to take about five five to six minutes okay depending on your mixer or uh blender you know okay so we'll get some soft peaks now all right so our egg whites are ready now we are going to take our dry ingredients and our spatula because we are going to fold our dry ingredients in very slowly so that we don't deflate our egg whites okay so we're just going to start with a little bit maybe about a quarter of it and just sift it in there and then we're going to fold just gently fold it in and we want to do this slowly and a little bit at a time because we don't want to have um you know just flower pockets and lumps in our mix in our in our tape mixture okay you're just going to keep folding until everything looks like it's good and incorporated okay you don't want to see any of the physical dry ingredients still sitting on top okay i'm just getting all the way down to the bottom just to make sure nothing is still loose in there okay all right so that looks good so now what we're going to do is take our bundt pan and keep in mind uh well i like using the bundt pan but keep in mind we don't want any fat to pull down our egg whites or deflate them so you it is very important that you do not spray your pan with anything okay um and it sounds like i'll make it a little tricky to get out but um i'll show you what to do when that time comes or what i do to make it easier to get out so we're going to go ahead and fill up our pan and you definitely don't want to fill it more than about two-thirds of the way full otherwise your angel food cake is going to rise outside of your pan okay so now we're going to pop this in the center of the oven um on an oven rack in the center of the oven on 325 degrees okay for about 40 minutes give or take a few okay we'll check it for doneness when that time comes so let's pop it in the oven okay everyone so this is what your cake should look like when it comes out of the oven just kind of a light golden brown um and what we're gonna do is to let this cool i've got a little cooling rack here and we're going to flip this over and let it cool upside down so i'm just going to stick this on here and voila so we'll just let this cool and then i'll show you easy way to get it out okay everyone so our angel food cake is cooled and ready to come out of this pan and i told you i would show you um kind of the easiest method i've found for doing it or the best method because of course we couldn't put anything in the pan to keep it from sticking because that would deflate our eggs so what i like to do is just take my smallest offset spatula and just kind of ease it down into the grooves of the pan and i try to stay as close to the edge as i can because i want to leave as much of that caramelization on there as possible i just love that part of the cake so i'm just going to kind of run this around and go ahead and just ease that away from the edges and then we'll take it out let me just shake it a little kind of see how my progress is going now i'm going to go in and just kind of lift a little bit as i go around and you guys this is just this is the best way i've found to do this um if anybody has found an easier way or better way you feel you have just please please comment and i'm open to suggestions on this anything to make it easier okay i can feel that it's loose now good okay so and i'm just going to pop this onto a um 10 inch cake board because this is going actually to my sister who loves angel food cake so i'm just going to put that on the underneath there and flip it out okay here we go absolutely beautiful now of course with this kind of cake most people will do just um just simple whipped cream uh whipped cream and some sort of berries is a great way to eat this okay but it's a very very light cake um just kind of melts in your mouth if you enjoyed the video if you love angel food cake um please like and subscribe and share and i hope to see you back in the future

Its light and airy texture is a result of\nsome not so typical cake techniques. Here's the secret for a tall and tender angel\nfood cake every time. This cake's delicate personality owes itself\nto the cozy marriage of perfectly separated egg whites with sugar. It begins with beating egg whites until soft\npeaks form. You can tell this when the peaks bend gracefully. Once this happens, begin adding the sugar\na little at a time until all the sugar is totally incorporated and the egg whites form\nstiff peaks like this and never ever grease an angel food or tube cake pan or use a nonstick\npan. This angelic batter needs to cling to the\nsides of the pan as it rises and bakes, so it reaches its highest potential. Slippery sides are recipe for disaster.", "p_ROBi4sWp4": "so it's not always about just adding the right seasoning to make food taste great food science plays a big role in how flavors are developed here's something to chew on from our partners at real simple to break down the science of delicious deliciousness for angel food cake when baking the god is in the details but there's a little science to it as well so today we are going to crack into the science of whipping egg whites to elevate a heavenly dessert we're gonna start by sifting powdered sugar and flour together three times which feels excessive but i promise it's worth it when you taste how light and fluffy this cake is [Music] we have 12 egg whites here room temperature eggs will give you more volume so give your whites around 30 minutes of time out of the fridge before you start the reason why we use cream of tartar is because it's acidic and acid helps give structure to egg whites because it helps them hold in water and air egg whites have to be whipped correctly because they're the only thing that provides leavening in angel food cake whites that are whipped into stiff not soft peaks ensure that your angel food cake will be light and airy looks like we have reached the soft peak stage which means it's time to add our sugar here we wait until the foam has already reached the soft peak stage before adding our sugar because sugar dramatically increases the beating time required to get good volume that being said it also helps preserve the structure of your egg proteins which makes it a lot harder to overbeat them and we're going to keep whipping until we reach the stiff peak phase let's pause and check i'm gonna show you guys what stiff peaks look like here's a great example it's like a peak that doesn't wilt over to the side so in four separate stages we're gonna incorporate this sifted flour mixture in to the egg whites and fold really gently because that's what helps preserve the volume great tool to use here is a silicone spatula because it helps you be really gentle [Music] and it's okay if they aren't perfectly incorporated because the most important thing is that you don't deflate your egg whites all right so i think we're ready to drop this batter into our pan again be really gentle and try to get it as even as possible if it's a little lumpy you can fix it later [Music] now very very gently don't press down just try to smooth out the top we're going to run a butter knife through this so that if any large air bubbles are left in our batter we'll pop them all right looks good we're going to bake this in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes this has been cooled to room temperature make sure the sides are loosened from the pan if you have to you can gently run a knife through and then we're going to invert it here just be gentle [Music] so as you can see with the proper technique for whipping your egg whites you'll make a beautifully voluminous fluffy angel food cake as you can see the volume and texture of your egg foam makes the biggest difference in desserts over or under beating egg whites can result in an overly dense angel food cake the good news is that anyone can whip a light and airy foam with up to eight times the volume for perfect angel food cake like this one with a little science there you go you're officially a better baker man

we'll be able to get while they're still cheap obviously other people have done videos talking about the difference of why they choose traditionally grown strawberries over organic strawberries and I

but don't don't that don't die doesn't that look delicious you know quit laughing at me I'll know I stutter god bless hang-hang god Bless You y'all have a good night bye-bye", "DX8FXjQ8tx0": "not always just about adding the right seasonings to make food taste great food science plays a big role and how flavors are developed and here's something to chew on from our partners at real simple when it comes to breaking down the science of deliciousness for angel food cake when baking the God is in the details but there's a little science to it as well so today we are going to crack into the science of whipping egg whites to elevate a heavenly dessert we're gonna start by sifting powdered sugar and flour together three times which feels excessive but I promise it's worth it when you taste how light and fluffy this cake is we have 12 egg whites here room-temperature eggs will give you more volume so give your whites around 30 minutes of time out of the fridge before you start the reason why we use cream of tartar is because it's acidic and acid helps give structure to egg whites because it helps them hold in water and air egg whites have to be whipped correctly because they're the only thing that provides leavening in angel food cake whites that are whipped into stiff not soft peaks ensure that your angel food cake will be light and airy looks like we have reached the soft peak stage which means it's time to add our sugar here we wait until the foam has already reached the soft peak stage before adding our sugar because sugar dramatically increases the beating time required to get good volume that being said it also helps preserve the structure of your egg proteins which makes it a lot harder to overbeat them and we're going to keep whipping until then we reach the stiff peak phase let's pause and check I'm gonna show you guys what stiff peaks look like here's a great example it's like a peak that doesn't wilt over to the side so in four separate stages we're gonna incorporate this sifted flour mixture in to the egg whites and fold really gently because that's what helps preserve the volume great tool to use here is a silicone spatula because it helps you be really gentle and it's okay if they aren't perfectly incorporated because the most important thing is that you don't deflate your egg whites alright so I think we're ready to drop this batter into our pan again be really gentle and try to get it as even as possible if it's a little lumpy you can fix it later [Music] now very very gently don't press down just try to smooth out the top we're gonna run a butter knife through this so that if any large air bubbles are left in our batter we'll pop them all right looks good we're gonna bake this in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes this has been cool to room temperature make sure the sides are loosened from the pan if you have to you can gently run a knife through and then we're gonna invert it here just be gentle [Music] so as you can see with the proper technique for whipping your egg whites you'll make a beautifully voluminous fluffy angel food cake as you can see the volume and texture of your egg foam makes the biggest difference in desserts over or under beating egg whites can result in an overly dense angel food cake the good news is that anyone can whip a light and airy foam with up to eight times the volume for perfect angel food cake like this one with a little science there you go you're officially a better Baker you're gonna whip your egg rights right next time I hope so now besides red velvet angel food is my favorite cake let's be honest I don't think I've ever met a cake I I didn't like", "1DUn1_8cjWM": "hey y'all it's lindsay i have gotten a ton of requests for my low carb keto friendly angel food cake recipe and i wanted to bring that to you today so this is a slice of my low carb keto friendly angel food cake it is super good it holds its shape really really well just a couple things um number one this recipe is um adapted from the trim healthy mama butterfly wings cake it um i do add some different things to it and i change up the ratios a little bit because i found with their cake it would sink into nothingness almost every single time this one isn't as light and fluffy that's the second caveat is because i added some a different ingredient to it it's not as light and airy it doesn't quite melt in your mouth the way that the butterfly wings cake does with the trim healthy mama um recipe um but that affords a couple of really cool things especially as far as not eating this just as a cake this is delicious but whenever it's delicious as a cake i should say but whenever you slice it and turn it into french toast it is fantastic i love eating it that way i also have shown a lot of times when i have cubed up this cake and turned it into kind of like croutons with my air fryer bag here it turns out so fantastic as sort of like a replacement for granola it's not as calorically dense as a traditional granola or even a keto friendly granola that'll just use tons of nuts and coconut and all those things that is a great alternative for a granola but this for some reason i just really like the crunchiness of it the lightness of it it just really feels like a sweet crouton whenever you cube it up and pop it in the airfryer so this has been a really versatile little cake for us and um let me show you how i make it all right first step is we're going to preheat our oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit the next step is to line my loaf pan with parchment paper i will not be greasing this pan because i want the batter to grab onto the sides of this parchment next up i need to powder up this sweet blend that i make myself i do have a video on this and i know that my little spice grinder that's dedicated to grinding sweeteners and psyllium husk i know this holds approximately a half cup so that's perfect for this and now i'm going to go ahead and pour one and one half cups of egg whites into a large bowl and then i'm going to sprinkle on one half teaspoon of xanthan gum i like to sprinkle it on top to sort of disperse it and not have one giant clump of the xanthan gum on the egg whites i like to break that up with my whisk and i'm using my immersion blender here and i'll be beating these egg whites into very stiff peaks i really love this small appliance in my kitchen i use it almost daily i use it for making mayonnaise for whipping cream it's just a super versatile tool that was very inexpensive at walmart and in my experience the inexpensive immersion blenders work just as well as the expensive ones now that my egg whites are totally beaten i'm going to combine my dry ingredients i've got one half cup of my sweet blend i'm going to be using one half teaspoon of baking powder i'm going to use one quarter cup of the isopure zero carb unflavored whey protein and one quarter cup of psyllium husks that i have ground up in that same coffee grinder that i used earlier and then i'm going to use one half cup a scant half cup of my oat fiber this life source oat fiber has been one of the best i have used personally it doesn't have a weird cardboard flavor i can get it on subscribe and save and it's really economical that way i forgot to add in some vanilla and i wanted a little bit more sweetness to the cake so i added in about half a dropper full of some stevia so maybe 20 drops and i'm gonna gently fold that into my egg white mixture so that it will incorporate well into my dry mixture the whole goal is that you don't want to deflate your egg whites too much they will deflate some just because you are agitating them but you want to keep them as light and airy as possible and try to fold your dry mixture into your egg whites gently but thoroughly because finding a pocket of dry ingredients in your final product is not the most pleasant thing on the planet i've got that pretty well mixed so i'm going to transfer that into my ungreased pan that is really key for this you really want your batter to be able to grab a hold of that parchment paper and rise well so i'm going to scrape out as much as i can and i'm going to smooth out my top [Music] into my preheated oven again that was 325 degrees fahrenheit i am going to slide my cake and i'm going to set my timer for about 30 minutes for this first round and then i'm going to check on it [Music] at around two minutes left i'm going to look at this cake it is turning a lovely shade of sort of soft yellow starting to get golden but it needs some more time so i flipped the cake around and i added 14 more minutes to my timer and now it is totally done it is a gorgeous shade of golden brown it's not jelly like in the middle it's firm but soft and it is ready to come out of my oven [Music] i'm going to use a toothpick tester just to verify that the inside of my cake is totally done that there's no more raw dough or batter rather this is a cake it's batter not dough and my toothpick came out clean and i'm ready to transfer my cake over to my cooling rack this is where that parchment paper really comes in useful i'm going to be able to completely remove my cake from my pan with it's not sticking to anything it does stick to the parchment paper which was exactly what we wanted it to do and now i am able to flip my cake around peel off that parchment paper it peels away beautifully there is no significant residue left on my parchment paper my cake comes out beautifully clean it has started to sink just a smidge which is very typical for an angel food type of a cake especially whenever you're not using standard sugars or flours whenever you're letting this cake cool you do kind of want to flip it back and forth sort of similar to the way that i did with my keto bread in a previous video and that really helps it to keep its shape i'm going to use a small serrated knife to slice through this cake and i want to be very gentle with it and just kind of take it easy because i don't want it to rip up on me and it's still a little bit warm so slicing is a little bit more delicate but as you can see it is a lovely texture apparently i've got some lightly whipped cream on top and um so it's a little bit of a process to make this of course i think with most keto baked goods it will be that way i've also got some raspberries here because if it's not pretty what is it okay so i have my little um angel food cake here and give it a taste for you that vanilla really makes a difference the original recipe that i adapted did not have any kind of flavoring whatsoever because you know an angel food cake doesn't really have a ton of flavor it's really just a soft spongy vehicle for whipped cream and fruit but but it adding the vanilla really amps up the flavor profile i'm gonna go and finish this and um i really hope you'll give this cake a try tell me what you do with it tell me how you change it to make it more user friendly for you um by adding in that oat fiber it really does make the difference for this having solid structure so that it can be more versatile the original recipe from trim healthy mama it's good don't get me wrong this i feel like it just it's more versatile we don't just keep around cake all the time just for the sake of having cake but whenever i can have something versatile like this i will keep it around a little more often so that i can off the cuff just make up some french toast or off the cuff just make up some sweet croutons for a yogurt and fruit parfait kind of a thing so again let me know if you try this out and i hope to see you in my next [Music] video [Music] you", "KYF09MpK4Kc": "when most people think of angel food cake they think of a white cake that is achingly dry and not very interesting and eaten only by people who don't want fat well in one of my favorite baking books by Rona sleepy Baron BAM the cake Bible she has a chocolate lover's angel food cake that's absolutely wonderful the downside of it is that you need two cups of egg whites unfortunately I made my son's wedding cake a few weeks ago and that required a lot of egg yolks so I saved the egg whites I froze them and since I'm having some company tomorrow and decided it's a good opportunity to make the chocolate angel food cake it's an easy cake to make actually but one of the daunting things about it is they have to fold in egg whites which is really not a big deal and I'll show you how to do it but I did was I got my preliminary mixtures all set I have my egg whites in the mixing bowl here with my balloon whisk inside I have some cocoa powder that's been mixed with boiled water whistle together and vanilla added and I have a mixture here of some sugar salt and sifted cake flour and I have a little bit of cream of tartar in here which is going to go into the egg whites so that just hasn't a stir fry you get everything ready to go it's easy to get everything ready to go the pan that's used for an angel food cake is an angel food which of course makes sense this is a two-part pan with legs and the reason that this separation you have legs is that this is not greased at all in fact grease is the enemy of beating up egg whites which is the one time that I make sure that there's not a scrap of grease left in the ball otherwise it will not be back properly and this is going to bake in here without being greased it will rise but when it's done since the cells are fragile and collapse it's cooled upside down balance on a bottle as I'll show you later when we get to that steak until it's thoroughly cooled and it's turned around and you scrape the sides carefully in order to get the cake out so that this is sort of a technique intensive cake the upside of it is that it is extremely low fat you're not adding any and the cocoa and I'm using a low fat cocoa is negligible no additional grease is needed and it's not an awful lot of sugar so it comes out moist and delicious and everyone who has it loves it so let started the first thing I'm going to do is to beat the egg whites just until they're frothy once they get frothy which we since we're bubbly then I'm going to add the cream of tarter and I'll beat it until I get soft peaks once the soft peaks appear I'm going to add the rest of my sugar and beat it until I have stiff peaks so let's get the eggs this is just barely soft peaks when I lift the beater you start seeing very soft peaks forming I'm going to beat it just a little bit more and then I'm going to start adding the sugar what I have here are stiffly beaten egg whites alright these will hold its shape big shape I'm going to take about a cup of the beaten egg whites and dump it right on top of that mixture of cocoa and hot water and and now I'm done with a mixer and I'm going to take my mixture of flour sugar and salt and I'm going to add a little by little the recipe suggests in a quarter cup of mouths to the meringue the beaten egg whites I'm sprinkling it over now when it comes to folding this is cool folding I find that this big beater works very nicely and just show you the technique and then I'm going to put it back on the counter I go down through the center and I come up the sides and over the top hey going to give it a quarter turn and I keep repeating it I've tried it with other implements with a balloon whisk and other kinds of spatulas and I find that this just seems to work well for me so you know when you try to find what works well for you they're specialized tools for this this works just fine the end here is not to get every little scrap in but to get it reasonably well mixed and then you add the addition just until it disappears as well as you can see white against white that's pretty good looks like this it's not quite as far as it was before we touched it but it's in pretty good shape now I don't the egg whites on top of the cocoa hot water and vanilla mixture I'm now mixing this together the reason that we do this is to lighten the mixture and help it blend in and almost every recipe that calls for folding something into beaten egg whites as you stir some of the egg whites into the mixture whether it's a souffle or whatever and even if you're not interested in making angel food cake the technique of folding is really important all right so you take this mixture that you've just lightened and you dump it on top let's get all of this good stuff out this is what's going to flavor our cake iced chocolate a nice dark cocoa flavor with just a little bit of vanilla to give it some added interest I never experimented with making it with mocha but I think I've seen some similar recipes based on this but do that all right yeah this is easier in a way because you can see when you're getting it how it's mixed and the aim is to get it uniform in color without deflating it too much it's the same folding technique and little by little you start seeing the dark streets of with disappearing and everything will be a cocoa brown it's a pretty uniform in color and I'm going to put it into the pan now this is a little tricky because if you get air spaces in here you're actually going to have spaces and you finished cake these just bake up differently from the usual cakes that 11 with baking powder so I'm trying to do this evenly you don't tap it because that would get rid of air spaces get rid of the air in the batter so that's not open to you but there's a little extra thing that's done so as I'm putting this in I'm trying to make sure that it fills the spaces look is pretty well smooth not least any of this good stuff and there's one final step to try to eliminate any air spaces and take a thin ablative spatula he was an icing spatula which is what I'm going to use to loosen up later and the suggestions you just go through it gently to eliminate air spaces it's just about the way you'd like to see it and I'm going to put it in the oven and according to my recipe it bakes about forty minutes which I found is pretty accurate I'll test it with a cake tester and then when it's done and I'll show you what it looks like and how we cool it timer just went off I'm going to see if the cake is done well certainly risen a bit and the test work is the same as you would do with most cakes I use the skewer is a cake tester insert it and it's coming fry so I found that the 40 minutes really does work now if I left it like this it would collapse so what we do is turn it upside down which you normally wouldn't do with the regular K but remember we didn't grease anything I'm using then all of olive oil because it has a narrow neck now what I'm going to do is sort of scary but it really isn't is to invert this on top is that real lampshade notice nothing happens it'll take about an hour and a half for it to cool thoroughly so the little bit of pan is that he should dissipate pretty quickly and once it's thoroughly cooled then I'll take a thin bladed spatula and we'll unmold it and see how we did so we're going to come back here in about an hour didn't happen when it's completely the cake is now fully cooled and we're going to unmold it this is a little tricky it still has stuck which is supposed to do so we have to loosen it when I find it something like this thin bladed spatula this is actually a an angled icing spatula work well we can use a knife with a thin blade you're depending on what you have at hand so I've loosened it up around the center and now the trick is going to be to work this I'm going to work this around the sides pressing against the sides one side we've seen the top up and trying to do as little damage as I can to the sides of the cake since this is typically not adorned now if it looks a little messy it'll show but it tastes so good no one will really care alright so now what I'm doing is working my way down pressing against the side of the pan actually pretty well I could have packed it better here it's a little sloppy no no one's really gonna notice and next time what I would do is pay more attention to the sides you have to keep it good to keep it nice and even when it comes out really well that all looks like this the last thing to do which I'm not going to do till tomorrow is to take these spatula and loosen it right here and then you flip it over it just becomes the bottom of the cake if nobody will see but since I wanted to refrigerate it overnight basically I'm going to clean out the pan I'll put this back in cover it with plastic and it will be older so I mean unless this is not aesthetically beautiful it will be delicious and actually if you serve it in slices no notice so I hope I've simplified this and give this a try if you want a really good tasting Matthew sweet and extremely loved that", "D6Q21i6OSQU": "hey you guys welcome to I cook in pain today I'm gonna show you how to make a soft fluffy angel food cake from scratch this is leaven totally with egg whites there's no baking powder no baking soda not even any oil or butter it turns out incredibly soft and fluffy and it can be eaten like that or used in other desserts this is also a really great recipe to make if you have a little bunch of egg whites lying around from making a lot of recipes using only egg yolks I hope you don't throw away those egg whites do you alright so we're gonna start off with some dry ingredients and I have here two sheets of wax paper because we're gonna be doing some sifting so right here I have 1 cup of cake flour and I'm gonna add it into my sifter and now to this I'm gonna add some salt and half a cup of sugar in total we need one of the quarter cups but for now just half so just add it right into the sifter and really it doesn't have to be exactly half a cup just roughly ok so now I'm gonna mix this together right inside the sifter oh boy now in order to get the fluffiest cake possible we have to sift this four times I know super boring this is my least favorite part of the recipe I won't show you all four times but I will show you how handy this wax paper is so you sift it onto one piece and then you can very easily lift it back into the sifter and sift it on the other piece alright so this has been sifted four times now I'm gonna set this aside now right here I have egg whites one of the third cups of them and that's about 12 large eggs worth you might need more or less depending on the size of your eggs but you do want one in the third cups oh and also make sure your egg whites are at room temperature because they'll whip up a lot easier that way so just start whipping them for a few seconds until they get home all right when it's really foamy like that it's time to add some cream of tartar so one and a quarter teaspoons the cream of tartar is gonna help stabilize the egg whites so they'll be even fluffier so now I just want to whip this until it reaches soft peaks this is gonna take a couple of minutes as soon as you start seeing that there's a trail being formed from the beaters you know you're really close to soft peaks so it should almost start looking like whipped cream all right so if you do this you can see that they actually hold a little peak this is what a soft peak looks like see and it's at this point that you want to start slowly adding in the rest of the sugar so the remaining three-quarters of a cup of sugar you want to add the slowly so that the sugar gets a chance to dissolve so I'm adding in about a tablespoon at a time all right once all the sugar is in now you want to continue whipping it until you reach really stiff peaks but first we need some flavorings so in goes some vanilla you could also do half vanilla half almond extract any flavoring really this is what it should look like after a couple of minutes all this air we're whipping in is what's gonna make the cake rise so just whip whip whip whip whip okay it's been a few minutes now and this is what the batter looks like so once the sugar goes in and you give it a few more minutes of whipping you can see that it holds a lot stiffer peaks than they look before now it's time to start gradually sifting in that dry mixture so I'm gonna sift it over the meringue a quarter cup at a time we want to keep this batter as light as possible we don't want to lose all the aeration we got from those egg whites so probably the best tool to use for this is a balloon whisk [Music] and do continue folding this in only one direction if you keep switching directions then you're really gonna deflate your bagger now in goes another quarter cup and so on until all the flour is gone and a good tip for folding is have one hand turn the bowl while the other hand just folds okay so that's it for my flour it's all been added in and as you can see if you're really gentle you don't lose too much volume only fold it enough so that every trace of flour has disappeared okay now let me show you the pan I'm gonna bake this in this is a twelve inch to pin this one's really good because the insert comes right out and one really important thing you don't want to grease it having it ungreased will give that batter a chance to climb up the walls the tube in the middle is also really important the batter is gonna climb up that also I wouldn't try baking this in a pan that doesn't have that too now I'm just gonna smooth the top just like that now if you're wondering what these little legs on the rim of the pan are for I'm gonna show you when the cake is done let your angel food cake bake for 35 to 40 minutes in a preheated 375-degree oven that's Fahrenheit and when it's ready it should be a light golden brown on the top and you can stick a toothpick in it if it comes out clean you'll know it's cooked all the way through but also if you just press on it and it springs back that's a good sign it's ready if your finger leaves an indentation the chances are your batter still wet and you have to bake it longer let it cool completely upside down and there you go that's what those little legs are for if your pan doesn't have those legs then rest the two part over a bottle and then when it's cooled completely you can take it out of the pan so the best way to do this is with a serrated knife so just start sawing it away from the pan and you'd think that because we didn't grease this this would stick a lot more but it actually comes out quite easily there we go see it wasn't that hard to take out if we had greased the pan we never would have gotten this nice volume I may have been a little aggressive and there's a little piece I'm just gonna taste it mmm so I'm just gonna cut a piece out of this oh it tastes good really nice vanilla flavor can do make sure this is completely cooled before you cut into it mm-hmm so I want you to see here how soft and spongy that looks seeing all that air we whipped into the meringue is what made this cake so fluffy all right let's break this piece open so you can see what the crumb looks like for a cake that has no oil or butter in it you're gonna be amazed at how moist this is and angel food cake will keep on your counter for two to three days or in your fridge for up to one week so should we give it a taste all right twist my arm mm-hmm angel food cake can be eaten just like that or quite often it's used in other recipes like trifle or what else is it used for anyway you let me know in the comments below and that's it guys go try out this recipe today and let me know what you think of it and hey if there's a recipe you'd like to see on I cook and paint let me know about it and I'll see what I can do I really appreciate you watching so thank you so much until the next video bye for now", "enVQhdVwo7o": "hey guys so today I'm going to be trying a Pinterest recipe that I thought looked pretty simple and easy to make it only involves two ingredients which are these two you need a box of the angel food cake mix and you need a can of the fruit pie filling and I got blueberry and it says your can should be about 20 to 22 ounces and I found this one which was 21 ounces so that's basically it you want to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and then it says to mix both of these ingredients so I'm going to go ahead and dump these ingredients in a bowl and mix them up okay so here is the mixture now I'm going to go ahead and pour it into a nine by 13 ungreased pan okay now we're going to go ahead and bake this for 28 to 30 minutes ok so the cake is done baking we're going to go ahead and let it cool for about an hour so here is what the cake looks like we've already eaten quite a bit of it you just want to go ahead and top it with some whipped cream and it tastes really really good it's very moist I think it was really good everybody else thought it was really good too so I would definitely make this again it was very easy to make only two ingredients and that's it hope you guys enjoyed this video and I will see you next time bye", "xUVk6cFdeII":

good kitchen today we're going to make an angel food cake we'd like to show you how easy it is we need a mixer we need our ingredients we have 14 egg whites a lot of people wonder how do you figure out what 14 egg whites are egg whites are usually one ounce by volume or one ounce by weight so we have one in three quarter cups of egg whites which is 14 ounces we have our teaspoon of cream of tartar we have our half of teaspoon of diamond crystal kosher salt we have our one and a half cups of sugar 1 cup of flour lemon this is via lemon angel food cake and a little bit of vanilla bean paste so to get started first thing you want to have as a stand mixer if you have it and you do by hand but i'll take you a little longer clean bowl no grease and site clean beater no grease on site we will go ahead and add our egg whites our sugar and cream of tartar and our salt to this bowl a lot of times the recipes will see they'll tell you to mix the whites till they're foamy and then gradually add in 1 teaspoon of sugar at a time but we like to show you you can throw it all in at once and it will work for you we put it on low speed to get started and then we'll go ahead and mix it on high speed depending on how many watts you have a power on your mixer will determine how long this is going to take to whip this is probably going to about 23 minutes maximum so once we get there we'll show you how to finish the interpretation hi welcome back well about four minutes has a laptop elapsed and time on this mixer for our egg whites to get to be the nice soft peak that we're looking for we're going to turn our mixer off find the thing there and we're going to lift this up and to determine if you're at the right peak stage it's we always say it's kind of like the Dairy Queen curl you lift it up and then you can see how it rolls over just like the Dairy Queen curl so we got a nice you know medium Pete going a medium soft peak going on here that's going to be perfect for us to put this angel food cake together let me get rid of the mixer to the side and we'll grab our big mixing board now what we want to do we want to take they say if you can hold your bowl upside down and the egg whites don't fall out and mix them enough so you can see we had that dumb usually a culinary school of chefs would have you hold it over your head making sure you really whipped it long enough so we've got our egg whites cleaned out of our mixing bowl here we've got them put into our big bowl and now we want to incorporate our flour into this to give it the structure so we need to get ourselves a sifter or a strain or whatever you want to call it take our cup of flour and we will tap half of that flower over the surface of our egg whites now this is what we call the lifting and tapping motion and we dig into the egg whites with the flour and we tap it so we lift it and we tap it so you can see how easy this incorporates that flour into our egg whites a lot of times we always say when we're teaching our cooking classes a lot of people want to just take and stir this hard like this just to get the flour mixed in but you have to understand the egg whites are our leavening agent here they're the only thing that's going to give this stuff or this cake arise so if we take and stir it really hard and break all those air bubbles up we're not going to get the rise and get that nice angel food cake so you can see how stiff my batter is becoming a nice structure going on we're going to add in the rest of our flour over the surface of the whites and then we're going to add a little bit of our vanilla bean paste a lot of people ask what's the difference between vanilla extract and vanilla bean paste vanilla bean paste you'll see when I pour this this is a thick paste this that was fortunately measured to one teaspoon I want you to know calibrated heels but anyway the vanilla bean paste singing GOG is the one we like it is the entire vanilla bean pulverized mixed in like with a syrup and then you add it to your whatever you're making angel food cake here and you get this big bold vanilla flavor so vanilla bean paste is the whole vanilla bean that has been pulverized and mixed up to create a paste vanilla extract means that you've taken vanilla beans put it in some sort of alcohol extract the flavor off the beam pull the beam out of there and then just put the vanilla extract itself in a bottle and sell that so you can see now how easy this is it's we always say it's faster to make your own angel food cake than to go to the store to buy one so we've got our flour all incorporated now that the flowers incorporated the Vanilla's there the sugar and everything we want to add a little bit of our flavor which is going to be our lemon zest we have our micro plane here and with the microplane we're going to zest off the skin of the lemon a lot of people say well how can you tell what's a teaspoons worth of lemon zest we say hold the piece of fruit like your fiddle and the microplane like your bow and you can see I got channels on either side it's collecting exactly what I'm taking off of this 11 so we'll take a couple teaspoons of this and then we will add this into our cake and now we get our spatula and we'll go ahead and we'll fold that lemon zest in there giving this a nice lemon flavor so you can see with the folding I'm just rolling my spatula round and sort of like in school they would always tell you a figure-eight method cake batter is already made now we want to get our angel food pan so nothing in the pan we don't need parchment paper we don't need p on nothing this is a delicate cake if you thought for ease of cleanup you'd want to spray something in there so you didn't have to scrub the pan you have to know that the cake is so delicate if you don't give it something to hang on to it won't rise in the oven for you so with that get this filled up and we'll put this in a preheated oven like everything we do we always preheat our oven before we start baking and we will return to it when it's done flatten it out a little and now we're ready to go to the oven now that we have our cake pan filled with the batter we're going to go take it place it in our preheated 350-degree oven we're going to put it in the middle of the oven there shut the door and we're going to set a timer for 35 minutes we'll test it and once it's done we'll show you how we can easily remove from alright welcome back our timer has gone off and our angel food cake should be done now so we'll pull it out of the oven Oh looks painful I have a wooden skewer here like to stick the skewer and pull it out skewer is completely clean means the cake is done and ready to come see how nice it held on to the sides of the hey yeah more for safety and now these angel food cakes always have a longer stem that's because we want to rest it or cool it upside down that our angel food cake has cooled you can see I can touch it it's cool to the touch you want to get your tool called an offset spatula you can see that this is a thin bladed spatula offset meaning the plane of the spatulas here on my fingers my knuckles are offset from whatever it is you're working on we just this just a cool little tool that you get we'll put it inside the inside edge of the cake pan and we will roll it around and that should loosen it up from the pin for us so now you can see this beautiful angel food cake now with your offset spatula you need to go on this inside stem or to whatever you want however you want to refer to it and loosen that up or release it from that and then with your offset you put it at the between the cake and the cake bottom and now you can hold this give your pin a turn and release it from the bottom and then it's as easy as putting your hand on the side of the cake give a little twist or one 23 twist pull that tube out come over to your cake plate set it down and voila angel food cake just that easy thanks for joining us", "onmVKibrg40": "hello everyone welcome to the Westland Public Library cookbook preview I'm Sara one of the adult services librarians at the library and I'm also a camera shy amateur home chef who has volunteered to cook under the scrutiny of film for your pleasure in this video I will be reviewing the complete America's Test Kitchen TV show cookbook 2001 to 2011 by the America's Test Kitchen for the uninitiated the America's Test Kitchen and affiliated shows Cook's Illustrated and cooks country are best known for their easy-to-follow cooking demonstrations that break down the art and science of cooking and baking their cookbooks include detailed cooking instructions recipes that are mindful of regional ingredient availability and scientific preparation methods that are great for novice and expert home chefs alike for this demonstration I will be preparing the angel food cake recipe I had owned this cookbook for years before I finally saw the angel food cake recipe prepared on the TV show never needing much prompting to bacon I gave it a goat and this instantly became my go-to cake recipe year round angel food cake is a science relying on just whipped egg whites to give it structure in shape many Baker's find angel food cake to be temperamental prone to simple environmental factors such as temperature and humidity but once you understand the nature and the process you will find you are able to make this cake year-round and the end result is always magical let's get started first adjust the oven rag to the lower middle position of your oven and preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit this recipe calls for 12 egg whites that are at room temperature the best tip I ever received was to crack the eggs one by one into a smaller container first so if you fail to separate the egg and yolk you will not ruin your batch of egg whites that you have been gathering I make this recipe multiple times per year I can't remember the last time I had to actually rely on this tip so I'm glad the video was rolling when I accidentally dropped the egg yolk into the white any new eggs should still be at the same temperature as the rest of the eggs as this could have an impact on the whipping process later for this recipe you will also prepare ten and a half ounces of sugar three ounces of flour 1 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/4 teaspoon table salt 1 and 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 1 and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract the liquids can be put in the same container this recipe also recommends a standing mixer and whisk attachment sifter or fine mesh strainer and a angel food cake baking pan I have with mixed success use bundt cake pans but I highly discourage this until you get to know the recipe ticket started you will whisk 3/4 cup sugar and your flour together in a medium bowl and set aside in your mixer with the whisk attachment you will whip the egg whites and cream of tartar together on a medium low setting for about 1 minute or until the mixture becomes foamy he will then increase the mixer speed to medium-high for another minute until the whites start to become pillowy mounds while the mixer is running you will gradually add in the remaining 3/4 the cookbook recommends one tablespoon at a time which I have literally done but I find that I'm often slower than a minute and so I've been slowly pouring sugar and with a measuring cup you will continue to whisk the eggs until soft peaks form the cookbook recommends between 1 to 3 minutes but I found it often takes me four minutes undoubtedly because of the temperature in the room once the peaks have formed you will remove the bowl from the mixer and gently mix in the liquids by hand using your sifter strainer you will gently sift in your flour sugar mixture 1/4 cup to start and gently fold the dry ingredients into your egg whites being careful not to knock out the air you will repeat this process with the remaining flour mixture once the flour sugar mixture has been combined you will scrape the batter into your prepared angel food pan then wipe down the edges of the pan and smooth out the top to achieve a flat top finish lightly Pat the pan on the counter three times in an attempt to remove the bubbles before placing it in an oven for 50 to 60 minutes as I've stated angel food cake is very temperamental and could deflate for a number of reasons including under whisking your aids and dough plating your eggs while incorporating or drying another possible factor in this would be to open your oven door to film your cake because you hadn't realized that your video has stopped recording the resulting heat loss will mean that parts of your cake will bake differently and it will become more prone to deflating even after resting as you will see in my end result do not open your oven door until the end once your cake is golden-brown you will remove it from the oven and place upside down on a kitchen funnel neck of a sturdy bottle or just on a wire rack you will let it cool for two to three hours but I will often leave mine overnight so that the cake will have more time to develop a caramelized flavor when you are ready to serve you will run a small kitchen knife around the edge of the cake to loosen the cake sides if you have a removable Center you will pull out the cake and similarly run your knife along the bottom to gently encourage it to let go I don't normally keep the pan upside down to do this and you will see that my cutting was uneven because of it but that just became my personal stash of cake your cake is ready to serve I often paired this with whipped cream and fruit when they take it on the go but you'll also find that this is a spectacular cake by itself the best part about this cake is even if you have a bad day such as accidentally deflating your cake because you've opened the oven and compromised your baking it will still be absolutely delicious thank you for joining me virtually

And today, I'm making a\nchocolate-flecked angel food cake using my Kenmore Elite\nOvation Stand Mixer, which makes all the steps even simpler. So we're going to start,\nactually, with our eggs. And with the mixer, I\nhave an egg separator. So I've got 12 eggs here,\nwhich I know seems like a lot. So you just start by cracking your eggs\none at a time into the egg separator. And see how the yolk stays\nin the separator, the white just drops right through into the bowl? Beautiful. And then I'm going to add just\na couple extra ingredients to help stabilize my egg whites. I've got some cream of tartar,\nwhich can go right in the top, and a little bit of salt. So\nnow that I've got those in, I can get my egg whites whipping. You want to let them whip on medium-high\nspeed until they reach a soft peak. And then we'll start to add the sugar. OK, so this has been going for\nabout three minutes on medium-high. We want a nice, soft peak. Now, I can add in the sugar. Using the pour-in top design,\nI can have the egg white whipping while I'm\nadding the sugar to it. You want to let it\ncontinue to beat until you get a nice, stiff, glossy peak. So let's take a look,\nand that's what we want. See how it's holding its shape\ninside the bowl like that? That's absolutely perfect. So now what I'm going to do\nis put the mixer on low speed. I'm going to beat in a little\nbit of vanilla extract, and then I'm very slowly going to\nadd my cake flour and sugar mixtures. So we put half of our\nsugar into the egg whites, and then we've got half that we've\nwhisked with some cake flour. And that will get gradually added. Very gently, we'll let\nthat fold into the batter. All right, now that all of our cake\nflour and remaining sugar is added, this is the secret ingredient that\nmakes this cake really special. It's actually unsweetened chocolate,\nwhich seems kind of surprising. But when you consider that an angel\nfood cake is actually really sweet, it's a nice sort of bitter note that\nreally balances the cake out well. So I've got my unsweetened\nchocolate right here. I'm using my grater accessory, so I\ncan actually grate the chocolate right into the batter. It makes it so easy. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now that all of our chocolate has\nbeen grated on top of the batter, we can just start this\nfor just about 30 seconds or so to let the chocolate mix\ninto the rest of the cake batter. [MUSIC PLAYING] Perfect. You don't want to over\nmix at this stage. You don't want to knock a whole\nlot of air out of the batter. I'm going to take the bowl off. During this whole process, I've had\nmy oven preheating to 350 degrees. And now, I have to grab\nmy angel food cake pan. This is what an angel\nfood cake pan looks like. It has a removable bottom, which will\nmake unmolding the cake really easy. And it has these feet on it. And the reason it has these feet,\nis because with an angel food cake, in order to keep its nice\nheight after it comes out of the oven, you have to invert it while it cools. You actually cool it upside down. And also, do not grease your pan. I know it seems sort of\nopposite of everything we've ever learned about cake-making. But in the case of an\nangel food cake, you really want the batter to climb\nup the sides of the pan. So if you grease it, it won't do that. So leave your pan ungreased. And then with all of this gorgeous\nbatter, of which there is a ton-- isn't this amazing how much\n12 egg whites can actually come to be when you get some great\nair into them with a great machine? It looks amazing. All the batter's in here. All right, so like I said, 350 degrees. And this doesn't take\nthat long to bake either. For such a big cake, you'd think\nit would be a long bake time. But it's really just about 30 or\n35 minutes, depending on your oven. Beautiful. OK, so our cake has been\nbaking for about 35 minutes. Now, the trick with an angel\nfood cake-- remember the feet that we talked about on the pan? That's because angel food\ncake cools upside down. So we're going to let this cool\ninverted like this for about an hour, until the pan is completely cool. And then we can slice it and serve it. Our chocolate-flecked angel\nfood cake is completely cooled, and I'm going to show you\nhow to get it out of the pan. We're going to start by loosening\nthe cake from the edge of the pan, and just work all the way around. We can use that removable\nbottom to-- ta-da! Pretty easy, right? Now, we're going to go back\nwith our offset spatula again, and get right between the cake. And just like we did with\nthe sides, except now we're trying to get it\ncompletely underneath the cake. I can feel the cake is nice\nand loosened from the core. And you can either lift it\nout and serve this as the top if you like, or you can just invert\nit onto the cake stand, like so. So let me show you what this looks like. Now remember, we have all of those\nflecks of unsweetened chocolate in here in the batter. This is my chocolate-flecked\nangel food cake. A perfect dessert for\nany time of the year. And it's made really fun and super easy\nwith the Kenmore Elite Ovation Stand Mixer.", "cOlHk56NfDw": "hi i'm angela from spinachtiger.com cooking big fat healthy food today we are gonna make one of my most popular recipes on the blown keto friendly angel food cake it's sugar free we're gonna use a swerve confectioner sugar so all we need our egg whites confectioner sugar almond flour a little bit of tapioca flour and some cream of tartar and then you flavor it the way you want to flavor it I'm going to use like a half a teaspoon of almond extract you can use vanilla or you can use like lemon zest that's up to you so I've got my almond flour and my tapioca flour so just give that a good stir and we won't see this until we fold it in at the very end so that's ready to go the next thing you want to have ready you want to have your cream it's harder already measured out and you want to have your confectioner sugar sifted really really really important to have this unsifted get that the next thing you're gonna need is an angel food cake pan and this is my mom's old old aluminum pan it's got these prongs on it which are awesome because what's gonna happen when you take your angel food cake out of the oven is you're going to turn it over and it's gonna sit on these prongs and you're not gonna touch it you're not gonna touch the cake you're not gonna touch this until it is completely cool okay I've got a little parchment just so that I can get this this thing out easy because it tends to stick the proteins of the eggs are gonna stick do not use any kind of of grease or shortening this has to be completely dry because your angel food cake is gonna climb and if there's any grease it's not gonna work another tip don't open that oven for the first thirty five minutes or you're also gonna have a collapsed cake now I'm gonna show you how I like to separate my eggs one of the secrets to a really good nice fluffy angel for cake is I've had these sitting out overnight so they're easier not just that they're easier to separate somehow the whites of the eggs are gonna be a lot fluffier then I just pull out my yolk I'm gonna make birdie know with these lemon viddy know which is also on youtube here you can check that out now we've got this we put it in a very dry clean mixer you can use a hand mixer but I like to use my KitchenAid and we do these one at a time because we don't want maybe if I make a mistake I always take out like 14 eggs in case I make a mistake clean okay we have 12 perfectly beautiful egg whites and we are gonna start whipping them once the egg whites start to get frothy then I'm gonna put the cream of tartar in and then I'm gonna watch it when I feel it's about halfway through I'm gonna put all of my confectioners sugar and remember this is swerve and I'm gonna put that in then when I beat it I don't want it to get too too stiff I want fluffy kind of soft whipped egg whites because if they get like really stiff they're just gonna collapse I'm also going to add in at various time I'm going to add in my extract and then I like to add in a little stevia glyceride I think it counteracts some of the cooling effect of powdered erythritol which is what this is [Music] [Music] [Music] after about four minutes this is what I got so it's nice I want you to see the consistency because this is what you want now we're going to pour over our dry ingredients and fold in and fold in well don't be too worried about it so I'm using this really giant spatula I recommend you get one they're like ten dollars it's from auks oh and I'll put a link it's also in my Amazon store but oh my gosh I use this for eggs and then I use it for everything else but I really really love this ice now I'm going to put it in I'm gonna put it in my pan I'm gonna do a turn the other tool that I think is really helpful for everything I'm baking is this offset spatula again a modest investment and I'll put a link and it's also in my Amazon store which I am an affiliate so I do earn a small Commission but you know that's not what's important here I just want to make sure you can go buy one that you have the right tools so this helps me even this out because we aren't using real sugar and we're using powdered erythritol this is probably the size it might it's gonna rise a little bit but it's not gonna rise a whole lot okay this is pretty much it I've got my oven set to 350 50 minutes pretty much works for me take it out of the oven and do what turn it over don't touch it leave it alone for several hours okay we'll be back to show you the finished product guys it's been about several hours actually since I let this cool completely I did not touch it in the last 10 minutes I saw it was getting brown and I put a piece of foil over it do not open the oven until at least 30 minutes have gone by or it's gonna collapse then I tonight I went all around like this and like this if for any reason it sticks and gets a little messed up don't worry about it angel food cake is difficult because you cannot use a nonstick pan so taking it up from the bottom and I have this one little messed up part that's okay it's not worth doing it over again and then I'm gonna and for the most part it's pretty successful that little thing was my fault so you've got your beautiful angel food cake and now I'm gonna show you how to cut it you need a bread knife because it's it's much much easier to do on a bread knife we're gonna take it out oh look guys it's fluffy it's fluffy it's just what angel food cake should be like and this is low carb sugar free now we're gonna just put a few strawberries excuse my hands a few little strawberries next to it I really like this with strawberry sauce but I didn't make any I'm just gonna show you this a little bit of strawberries and I have a video on stabilized whipped cream and a blog post super easy you can keep this in the refrigerator a couple of days just like this and then we're just gonna do a little bit of that so you can just eat it together of course you're gonna want me to taste it and if it's in the morning so this this is breakfast for me it's it's morning it's like 9:30 let me get some whipped cream on and get some cake oh my gosh childhood memories right okay now I just want to pick this up and just show you how this just pulls apart notes in your mouth and you know what else you can do with this you can slice this in even slices you can make french toast so when you have left over you can grill it with a little butter but I obviously tried it with as a french toast so if you're only like the keto diet and you're like really craving something sweet make french toast that's my angel food cake it is the most popular post at we're spinning tiger comm number one post

five-year-old son practically made the whole thing and the taste heavenly", "lbrTmjZdmlA": "I'm ready to do the final decoration with my angel food cake so I'm gonna start with my Chantilly a quenelle so I have my warm water a little top top on the towels you now that I have my quenelles in place I'm gonna do my orange Supremes next because they have a little bit of extra juiciness I don't want to add them too late in the process because that orange juice could seep into my Chantilly so I'm going to position these first I have had them draining on a paper towel just to grab any excess moisture and I'm gonna use this Chantilly just to sort of help hold these in place try and give them some nice height and variation and also I'm using them to disguise any part of my quenelles that I maybe wasn't quite happy with this is a nice opportunity to do some disguising okay I think that's a good amount of oranges so now I'm going to come back with some rosettes and I'm gonna do just some simple stars as well so just hold and then lift up the stars are really nice fillers and now I'm gonna come with some fresh berries so um I want to start with my biggest pieces first I have some strawberries that I've cornered and then I also have I had roasted some strawberries from some that were kind of going bad so I have this beautiful syrup so instead of me having to use a neutral glaze or something like that I'm actually using something that already has strawberries in it so anything that has a cut edge I want to put a little bit of that glaze on so that it doesn't dry out while this cake is waiting to be served you don't want to put too much on because it will start to bleed into the Chantilly this is just something to seal the surface you okay so my strawberries on and now I'm gonna add in some raspberries you and for my last touch I'll put on blueberries you since I did use almond extract in the cake I also want to make sure and give that little hint so I'll just add a few pieces in here so that no one has any surprises and that's my finished angel food cake you", "FW-sPL_Ywcs": "hi I'm mullah Robertson Norman and chef and owner at your service and why catering located in orangeburg New York that is just outside of New York City today I'm going to show you how to make an angel food cake filled with strawberry cream and here's what we need for it the ingredients for today's angel food cake are a quarter of an angel food cake some chopped up strawberries about three quarter cup of ricotta cheese some confectioners sugar and some vanilla I chose to use one quarter of the angel food cake only for one particular reason angel food cake is very spongy and very soft and if you cut the whole cake you might smash it especially if you are not used to do these kind of things and it's easy enough to fill all four quarters then put it together and then put some icing on top and nobody will ever know that you cut the cake in four pieces so the first thing we are going to do I have the ricotta cheese i will add about two tablespoons of powdered sugar and the strawberries so you can do it in a blender if you like but it's so easy enough I like to do it with a fork oh maybe a drop of vanilla just for taste so this is a very quick and easy filling for a cake but it's only good if you want to eat the cake right away because if the strawberries would sit for a long a period of time they would release their juices and the cake would be running a little bit if you wanted to do the same thing that keeps the cake for a while then I would cook the strawberries with a little bit of confectioner's sugar and sticking them either with cornstarch or with gelatin and then combined with the ricotta cheese so this is actually ready to go into the cake right now and let me fill it in okay I like to add a fair amount because strawberries and angel food cake wonderful together so and then top it with the other quarter so you could I sit but it will be wonderful to eat just as is which is what I will be doing and voila I just showed you how to make angel cake with strawberry cream filling the Holloway heavenly", "FmPkM4IfGCA": "as a pastry chef I love making chiffon cakes because they're just so universally popular but also like me as a baker versatility in the kitchen I'll start with the basics and angel food cake just light as air then I'll advance things a step further and make my mini lemon chiffon cakes with a tart and tangy lemon crystal glaze then it'll be time to work into a more restaurant worthy dessert my warm maple almond chiffon cakes to dress them up a little bit I'll take those same maple almond chiffon cakes and show you four seasonal platings because really a chiffon cake is a dessert for all seasons now for the angel food cake I start with eight egg whites my eggs are at room temperature and that is an important element when it comes to making anything with whipped egg whites because a room-temperature egg white whips to a fuller volume than one right out of the fridge I want to add a little cream of tartar half a teaspoon cream of tartar is an acid but in a powder form it's quite concentrated it's that acidity that actually allows the egg whites to stretch to a fuller volume it gives them flexibility just a touch of salt but the salt balances the sweetness and I'll start by mixing this with the whip attachment you can use electric beaters but on a lower speed just until it's foamy while I get my half a cup of icing sugar sifted and ready to add when you see that your egg lights are foamy and frothy and they're starting to lose that off-white color then you know it's time to add your icing sugar now what I'm looking for here is a medium peak and that is when your egg whites just have a half curl when you lift the beaters what that does as a medium peak it still allows room for those egg whites to expand in the heat of the oven is going to do that and now I need to sift the dry ingredients a full cup of cake and pastry flour a cup of regular granulated sugar in addition to that icing sugar I added but sugar in a cake lends structure and it makes the king rise up really tall I'll add a half a teaspoon of vanilla it probably earns its name angel food cake because it is quite virtuous no added fat so the second sift I'll be right over the bowl another reason angel food cake deserves its name is it is quite angelically simple you've got these simple combination of ingredients but it achieves that chiffon status in that airiness that moisture you never get a crumbly angel food cake the whisk allows me to fold in the flour and sugar without tearing the beautiful air bubbles I worked into the angel food cake the sugar is dissolving as I fold it so it changes the consistency see the batter something characteristic of all chiffon cakes is the pan you bake it in in this case you use a 2 pan now the features to note are the straight sides and bottom that way the cake can climb and come out easily you've got the hole in the middle it allows the cake to bake evenly because they heat from the oven gets right through to the center but also some pans are built with little feet on the outside this one has an elevated tube Center because all chiffon cakes have to cool upside down to stretch those egg whites so this allows the air to get underneath it another common characteristic about chiffon cakes you never grease the pan and that sounds absolutely ridiculous but you actually want the cake to stick to the sides of the pan as it climbs and Rises with the heat of the oven it needs something to cling on to I'll just spread it around the tube make it as level as you can right off the top I've preheated the oven to 325 because that gentle heat slowly coaxes the egg whites up and gives time for the sugar and the flour to set so it's a nice fluffy light airy cake and it takes about 30 to 35 minutes all right it's been just about 35 minutes you check the doneness of any chiffon cake by just pressing the top when it springs back you know that it's fully cooked I want to flip that cake upside down see this is why we do not grease the pan and you want to cool it upside down fully and completely in the pan then you take it out after the cake has cooled and I have one that's cooled completely so use an offset spatula and I have to loosen it from the sides and pants so I just run the spatula straight down and to loosen it from the inside too but using a little bamboo skewer just gives it a little space so that when I tap it out it comes out easily so this is the fun part now that's a beautiful angel food cake I like to serve it with little fresh cream and berries and look at that beautiful puffy light interior so with the simple technique you really get a handle on the basics behind chiffon cake so you're ready for the next level my mini lemon chiffon cakes with a lemon crystal blades", "wadF2-5d6oQ": "hello everyone today we are making angel food cake why is it called angel food cake because it is made by this beautiful angel just kidding it's because it's light and fluffy and there's no fat in it which you can then tell yourself it means it's really healthy right um so this is a cake based off of egg whites I have um this liquid egg whites which usually doesn't whip up very well but we're gonna try it out today because I had this leftover and I'm trying to use it up because we're in quarantine and what else are we gonna do with a liter of egg whites I don't know so you can also make this with regular egg whites it probably takes about 12 of them if you're someone who uses a lot of egg yolks like I sometimes need them for hollandaise sauce my favorite thing to eat is eggs benedict so you can always freeze your egg whites in the freezer in a little ziplock bag and then let them thaw out and use them for a cake like this once you have enough so we're gonna try it out and hopefully it works today um but we'll find out so before I turn on the mixer I'm just gonna sift together my flour I've got 3/4 of a cup plus 2 tablespoons of regular flour ideally you want 1 cup of cake flour but I don't have that so instead I have the regular flour plus 2 tablespoons of cornstarch as well as one and a quarter cups of icing sugar and this is one recipe where you do need to sift I normally have a gaint sifting because it's a whole extra step but since it's such a light fluffy cake we want to do that so we make sure everything stays light and fluffy so I'm gonna sift that three times so I'll just pop all that stuff in here I like to sift onto a parchment paper because then I can just fold it with a crease in the middle like so and then easy dumping into the sink so I have two pizzas well sift it onto one and then pop it out and sift it onto the other this is just a sifter I used to make pasta and stuff just from the dollar store nothing crazy if you got one of those ones go for it I don't because like I said I don't like sifting things awesome so I'm gonna sift away and then I'll be right back and we got it flour icing sugar cornstarch mix 53 times now so I'm just putting that to the side and then I've started whipping my egg whites up oh we're making a meringue here and then we're gonna fold the flour mix into it so I started whipping just egg whites you can kind of see they're already getting little soft peaks in them so now I'm gonna start adding my sugar and salt and lemon juice the recipes for most angel food cakes require cream of tartar but I'm locked in my house so I don't have that we're gonna just replace it with um one teaspoon of lemon juice so I'm gonna pop that in cream of tartar is an acid so hopefully we can replace it with this acid this is just bottled lemon juice I like having it on hand because lemons get really expensive sometimes and this way I always have it so I've got that in there as well as one oh my god it's fine 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt throw a little over your shoulder because you just spilled salt everywhere and good luck or something all right so we'll turn this on and it was the being Chloe add a touch of regular sugar and I asked in my sorry butt where you wanted to view today lemons or brown sugar so we're going to be lemon muscle on out if you did want to a brown sugar flavors evil booty it would be brown sugar what we're doing lemons so well we had an inner regulation berry you don't want to dump it all in at once with is gonna collapse our meringue and we don't want to do that slowly adding in minutes of mixing or whipping I should say on a high speed and I meringue looks beautiful brings make me nervous sometimes so I'm really happy about this turned out if you are making this make sure there's no grease or oil on any of your mixer bowl or whisk because that will make it not whip up but this is amazing so oh my god here's a panther it's fine so into this since we're making lemon I'm gonna add one teaspoon of lemon extract that I have here if you have a actual lemon you can zest it with that micro plane we've been using for Parmesan cheese but I don't and then normally if I make something with lemon I add a few drops of yellow food coloring just because your brain thinks to taste more lemony when it's yellow magic but I don't have that here so lemon extract it is only and then Intimus we're going to very carefully fold in our flour icing sugar mixture I'm gonna do a motion like this very gently and add this in probably about three or four this is why the parchment helps cute it's kinda like a little funnel okay and our goal here is to keep the air inside of the meringue and not deflate it too much so as soon as most of this flowers hold it in there see how I'm lifting from the bottom and folding over top that's what we want to do alright so that was our first batch we're gonna add some orange and keep going I'm gonna keep doing that and I'll be right back so we have all of our flour mixture mixed in here but look how fluffy it still is if your batter is turned to liquid still baking it might work but it might not also work who knows it's a magical delicious thing so an angel food cake normally gets baked in the angel food cake pan which has this removable bottom magical you can be getting out of their parents it might be a little bit denser because this guy has a hole so we can flip it upside down when it comes out of the oven but I have baked it and other parents - it's still good I just love eating angel food cakes the weird thing about this cake batter is since there is no fat in it we don't want to grease it at all we want it to be completely dry no pammer anything cuz the dryness on the side is gonna help your batter crawl up and be nice and fluffy so we'll pop this into the pan and then I'm gonna bake it in a 350 degree oven for about 40 ish minutes so we're just plopping her in there all the way around we try not to work it too much because like I said we're trying to keep all that air in there evenly get it around there just slightly spread this perfect and then I feel old grannies would tell us to do we're supposed to run around through the middle with a knife I believe the theory on this is that it's going to knock out any big air bubbles but maybe it's just good luck I don't know all right into the oven we go for about 40 minutes until it's golden-brown all right our angel food cake baked for 40 minutes exactly I'm it was all charring on it as soon as it was baked I flipped it onto these little cans so that it could cool upside down and I've already loosened it so it's kind of pulling up look how gorgeous that is um so it won't pop out like that immediately I rhyme a knife around it just to get it out there smells so good and then this is the benefit of having a removable bottom on your pan so I'm just gonna tuck a knife into this edge here loosen it up a little and then this cake is super delicious was just whipped cream and berries um kind of like a strawberry shortcake I guess but it's also good just on its own all right the moment of truth so um so it's all done all ready to go angel food cake a gift from the Angels awesome well thanks for joining me today I'll see you guys tomorrow for something else delicious bye", "yFBlWSv4Dns": "hi I'm Greg patent and today we're going to be making angel food cake which is really really easy if you follow a few simple rules we begin with egg whites and I have one and a half cups of egg whites that are almost at room temperature but actually all they really need to be is not refrigerator temperature so about 60 degrees Fahrenheit put them into the bowl turn the machine on and what you're going to want to do first and I'm always amazed when you take this floppy egg white and you turn it turn it on in the machine and let it whip a little bit it starts frothing out we're beating air into it and in about 30 seconds or so it'll be frothy and at that point we can add our cream of tartar so this is what i mean by frothy there's just some bubble formation on the top and then here's the cream of tartar one-and-a-half teaspoons I started with one and a half cups of egg whites one-and-a-half teaspoons of cream of tartar cream of tartar is an acid it's a stabilizer and it makes the whites table so they're not going to lose the air that you've taken the time to get into them also make sure that your bowl and meter are absolutely free of priests and then we're going to want to beat this probably for a minute or two on a medium to a medium-high speed just until the egg whites form soft peaks okay let's check the whites and see what we have okay to see how the egg whites kind of form peaks but then they they kind of curl a bit they're very soft and they're very creamy and this is what you want them to be you don't want them to be stiff at this point you're just getting them ready to accept the sugar so we're going to turn this on again at medium speed and then I'm going to gradually add three quarters of a cup of sugar I've already sifted three quarters of a cup of sugar with a cup of flour i'm going to add that a little bit later but i'm just going to add this sugar gradually about a tablespoon or so at a time and then once all of the sugar has been added I'm going to add one and a half teaspoons of vanilla and then increase the speed to medium-high and then keep beating the whites until they form stiff peaks ok now these whites have filled the bowl I'm always just absolutely blown away by what happens to egg white and and let me just show you what a stiff peak is this out of the way yeah that's a stiff peak see how the whites hold their shape in the spatula and then if you actually look right down clothes right down close as I'm swirling the spatula around you can see that when I lift it up you got stiff peaks and that's exactly what you want now this bowl is totally filled with egg whites and we need to fold the dry ingredients into here so I'm going to go get a bowl and scrape these whites into the wall and what you have done with all of the beating is that you have created millions of little air cells and the point here from now on is to make sure that you maintain as much of the air as possible in these egg cells so these egg white cells so here's the the whites in this nice white bowl and then we're going to start folding in the dry ingredients ok I have in the sifter I have one cup of cake flour so these egg white cells so here's the the whites in this nice white bowl and then we're going to start folding in the dry ingredients ok I have in the sifter I have one cup of cake flour three-fourths of a cup of sugar and a quarter teaspoon of salt I've sifted it together four or five times just to mix it really really well sift about a fourth to a fifth of the dry ingredients over the egg whites and I just want to show you this folding motion what you want to do is incorporate the dry ingredients in and deflate the whites as little as possible so you go all the way to the bottom of the bowl scoop up the whites bring it to the top turn your bowl a quarter of a turn and just keep repeating the motion until most of the dry ingredients are incorporated then take another quarter or so of dry ingredients and just repeat this process remembering to turn the ball around and you really are folding in the dry ingredients and the object is to maintain as many of the egg cells as possible the air cells that you've beaten in without deflating the whites because this is the only leavening that takes place in making an angel food cake all of the dry ingredients are folded and you can see how nice and creamy the batter is just be very gentle with it and you can see why you need a white bowl because you need a lot of the space in order to do all of the folding properly and at this point you want to just transfer the batter into your angel cake pan this is an aluminum two piece none it's not nonstick it's just a regular aluminum pan I've had this pan probably for 30 years or so and just scoop the batter into the pan and when it's all in the pan you're going to want to level it with the spatula and then before you actually do that I'll show you one more little trick the batter is is all in the in the cake pan but when you look in the pan you'll see that they're let their air pockets so I'm just going to kind of flatten this out a little bit and then take up just a regular dinner knife and then run circles through the egg white actually through the batter what you're doing is you're cutting any large air pockets ago don't have like ugly spaces in here and then once it's all in there like that and just take your spatula turn the pan around like this level it and it's ready to go into a cold oven I'll repeat that a cold oven not a preheated oven on the lower third and then you turn the oven on to 375 degrees and you bake it for about 35 to 45 minutes until it's nice and puffed and brown it'll rise to about an inch from the top they'll be cracks in the cake and cake tester should come out clean and it also should spring back when you press on it gently and then when you run a thin bladed knife around the edge it'll release the cake you just lift it out and then once the cake is out of the pan and it's all cool you cool the cake upside down you probably know that but when the cake comes out of the oven you hang it upside down on on a wine bottle let it cool for about three hours and then this keeps the structure of the cake intact and then to remove it from the bottom of the pan just rotate the cake like this it'll be dislodge it from the bottom of the pan you don't really need to use another knife and then turn it like that and there's your angel food cake get it on to dessert plate cut it into slices you can serve it plain you can serve it with whipped cream or ice cream I like doing some whipped cream and then some fresh fruit and you have a very elegant dessert if you have any questions please write always happy to receive questions and comments this is great patent", "DK673RzmrKo": "[Music] soft and so I lies to the true hey everyone welcome to the health club today I'm going to be making a very low-calorie angel food cake the actual cake part is just protein almost zero calories and then the toppings whipped cream or coconut cream and fruit of your choice is where the calories will come from but all together a very good switch off a regular cake what we're going to need for this recipe is a carton of egg whites the recipe calls for eight so you could use regular leggings if you want this is better whatever fresh fruit of choice you want to use for the cake apple cider vinegar cornstarch and Splenda you can use stevia but I've only tried this recipes on this so I don't a little turn out the same first things first we're gonna want to preheat our oven to 300 and we'll that's heating up we're going to get our egg whites ready so you're going to need to put eight egg whites in here so I'm just going to measure it on the back it says how many tablespoons equals one egg white so I'm just going to measure now we have our egg whites measured I'm going to now go and whisk them I'm going to be adding gradually the Splenda and the cornstarch I've pre measured the cornstarch and Splenda the cornstarch is four teaspoons and the Splenda is a tablespoon and a half of Splenda I'll put it all below though so I'm going to bring those over with me now that our egg whites are in Peaks I'm going to be adding the cornstarch Splenda and apple cider vinegar apple cider vinegar two teaspoons and then these are pre measured which I'll drop below so I'm just going to add those all together into the egg whites now we have whipped all the ingredients together it should look very fluffy and airy like that like a sliver like foam we're going to put it on our pin now I'm gonna make it - because my cake is gonna be double layered and you're gonna want to try and make it as like thick as possible and around the same size so it's not as hard as you think just make it kind of like a circle so it ends up being like a cake now we have our two angel food cakes this is a very similar recipe to how you make meringue so if you would just sub the Splenda for sugar or stevia baking sugar this would be hard and crunchy like a meringue was so instead though this fund emit light kind of airy so this that's what we're gonna do these are gonna be in for an hour now let our angel food cake is in the oven for an hour I'm going to make whipped cream now you could also sub this for coconut cream I just chose whipped cream because I'm making this for people who eat dairy so I like the way that I think whipped cream is I just like to put it in this blender and it blends it in like one second I'm just going to pour it in here also if you'd like you can add vanilla or some more Splenda or stevia to this make it sweeter I personally think the cake is sweet enough I'll just make it as it is so we're just gonna go to the blender now our angel food cake is out of the oven it will look like this and it will be a little spongy let it cool for like 20 minutes before so it's completely warm when you put the whipped cream on or coconut cream on so I'm just going to show you how I would make it I'm gonna do two layers cuz I like that my whipped cream was whipped and then I'm just going to now in between I my fruit of choice is strawberries so I cut them all already and I'm just going to place them in the middle of the cake like this I'm going to put a little more whipped cream on top of these strawberries just so sits a little higher and I'll put my top layer on and put another layer of whiskey on top this one so this is the finished product of our angel food cake now you could definitely sub it for a dairy-free option different fruit choices whatever you want but technically this is a very low calorie cake the whipped cream is just mostly the fat in the cake and other than that it's awesome for you you could finish the whole thing yourself um so you have let me know if you guys make it and

pumpkin spice pumpkin pie spice and then over here is the cinnamon frosting it's the powdered sugar cream cheese butter cinnamon and vanilla okay first thing you're gonna do put your angel food cake into a mixing bowl and you're gonna put it in about a teaspoon pumpkin pie spice maybe lunch tray then I'm not even to turn this on yet but I'm gonna mix this in like this see I'm just incorporating it me I'm just a meme you don't have one of these little hand mixers just use a fork that's what I normally use but I'm trying to use the stuff I got my kitchen there wow it smells really good okay now put in your pumpkin puree see I know if I use this mixture it's gonna go everywhere I'm such a wuss I am I'm just gonna mix it gently with a spoon I can't use this I know you guys would love to see me throw this cake batter all over the air but that little voice inside of me is saying just use your spoon so I'm gonna incorporate this right now there we go okay look look how nice and light and fluffy there we go spread out come on there we go all right there okay so you're gonna bake this 25 to 30 minutes there until the edges are golden brown and the center kind of springs back to the touch okay so it was 15 20 minutes I did it for about 17 minutes you could see I flipped it onto a cooling rack it's really dense it's still warm you want to let this cool but look at the thickness see it's beautiful I don't know why there's a little hole there this is the bottom of the cake so I guess I was just a pocket of air or something but look how perfect it is we're gonna cut these in squares in a minute so go let this cool let's go make the frosting all right so let's start our frosting since our cake is now cooling there we go this is 8 ounces of cream cheese it only asks for 6 so I'm gonna kind of guesstimate right about there okay so the first thing now I'm gonna try using the this kind of wand what do you call it I don't know I think it's Cuisinart yes Cuisinart all right let's see if this works let me match everything first there we go how many time you do that for it then you go that's working really well Oh some just shot across the room okay so the other mixer worked great but I'm going back to my old fashioned double mixer because I can control the speed a lot better it says all it was just too powerful okay put your vanilla in I'm gonna mix that all up alright next slowly mix in the powdered sugar so you can do a little at a time okay and last but not least you're gonna put in your cinnamon okay so there you go it's all mixed in the cinnamon is in

set look and he tries to lift the pumpkin by this amazing look he broke my freaking pumpkin nice job", "jV9fq_ufdRU": "today I'm making angel food cake to start sift your flour into a bowl and mixing your caster sugar and leave on the side for later separate your eight egg whites and pour into your mixing bowl wish'd you're eight eggs on a medium speed until they turn frothy then sift in your cream of tartar add your salt and continue whisking until soft peaks form add your remaining castor sugar a small amout at a time and continue whisking until glossy firm peaks form add your vanilla extract and continue beating until it's all combined next we are going to fold in our remaining dry ingredients in about four stages trying to keep as much air in the mixture as we can pre-heat your oven to 160 degrees fan for other temperatures they'll be listed here transfer the mixture into your tin and run a pallet knife through it to get rid of any of the air pockets and finally smooth over the top placing the oven for 20 to 30 minutes until a nice golden brown or a skewer comes out clean let your sponge cool on a glass or a jar to stop it from sinking run a knife around the edge of your tin and transfer to a serving plate don't worry about any of the sponge being left on the tin this happens I like to serve my angel food cake with some whipped cream and some fresh berries this is such a light and airy cake if you're feeling something more chocolaty don't forget to check out my video on devil's food cake I'm now on Instagram so don't forget to check me out in the kitchen with Kate I'll be posting photos as I bake so that's angel food cake easy you", "nvzhNkjJTD0": "it'll just finish it off with a spatula you know this is such a quick and easy cake to make it takes Oh 30 to 35 minutes to bake and it takes an hour and a half to cool also I think you want to avoid doing it when it's humid up especially people were writing to me from Singapore they didn't say they were from Singapore they just said that there are angel food and chiffon drops out of the pan regularly and it finally occurred to me to ask them where they were writing from into the Singapore it's so humid there that extra weight of the water is too much for the wait but it's in the pan yesterday I just wanted for once and for all to see what the difference is you can just put it in the pan or spreading it on first and the one that I spread on be so much nicer side I started doing that some years ago and start wondering if it was really necessary but you don't even get big holes inside if you just spread I'll show you what it looks like when I'm done almost to the top because the egg white will start drying the minutes goes in the oven and it doesn't start rising for about five minutes I'm just doing it for the outside portion you know we should bake this where maybe creating a whole new thing to I'd like spybots by angel food will have the crumbs integrated somebody just called me yesterday to ask if they could take cookies and a whole bunch of leftover cookies and turn them into crumbs and then bake them at as using it instead of cake flour instead of flour in a cake I said oh do and let me know how it works out but you know I think you're going to have destroyed the ability of the flower to gelatinize in fact I'm sure they're okay so now the rest of it gets schooled in oh and then at the end I'm going to go through it with the spatula to make sure they're no big pockets I like to leave it uncovered after it comes out of the oven and after its cooled i invert the pan and when it's unmolded i leave it uncovered for at least an hour because otherwise the moisture on the inside of the cake makes the top of its sticky and that's why if you make it on a humid day you also get a very sticky tongue so this is what cake in order to worry about drying out as much as others but you know that the store-bought ones have been so elastic and rubbery that I recommended using them for the bottom of a cheesecake because they're you know tasted because all the nice lemon and sour cream it comes out of the cheesecake goes into the angel food cake and I'm sorry and it makes it more in the minute you get against the moisture loses all of its rubber eNOS and becomes really tender so that's why if you start with a really tender one will become mush I just like I wouldn't necessarily if I were doing this a for television i would say okay this is as far as we go because it takes hours to scrape the bowl clean but i want you to see how it should fill japan when it's beaten this way besides when I did to my TV show producer kept saying to me stop scraping because a hundred dollars is fun she must be causing that interference but you know in baking if you don't scrape the bowl you could end up with an entirely different cake because so much of it can stand a bowl it throws off the ratio of other ingredients see it all about every cake that we made every ingredient was weighed so that each one is identical the only difference now the pants are identical the only difference is the type of flower so here's what you can all see happen if you wrapped it on the contrary tutorial again don't do that well you're building all this volume into it into a cake special i canna Jen was when you're meeting it and by wrapping it you lose a lot of them this if I wrap it nothing it's going nowhere because it's so stable but I would never do that to jen was but I would do I would do to a layer cake except once I did and have it squirted out on the window I was teaching a class and I scraped it also big toe I haven't any choice hard I know about this Carl some timer cuisinart years ago asked me that is he took a step toward me in a kind of menacing intimidating wait he said does it make any difference if he tapping see her to my talking about somebody was a voice that says stop what I grabbed it doesn't make any difference if you do that and I said no and he said and then he took a step even closer and he said and it does it make a difference if you sift the flour and I took a step closer to him and I said it certainly does well I think that's it oh no it's time to eat so please pass out the samples and then after you had a chest there's one sample that you should not try until the end because it's like where the chocolate tasting we always start with them sweeter one and go to more bitter if you try the fur the one that we tell you not to first you won't be able to taste the images so the one that's what bluey-green must be color-block the one that's great is the ones who saved for the end which do you think they should start with I guess start with the red start with a red go to the blank take a look and see what it looks like your color field texture and look at the cell structure and then oh I forgot to tell you something really important and that's what the great thing about angel food cake is that it used up every one of my egg white collection though the pastors and at these all your two years old four year old egg whites and they performed exactly the same but the thing you can't do is to freeze them and then refreeze them you know they can't throw a freeze because they won't have quite the same starting to read then load no color and the have you seen everybody have okay Oh somebody's gonna taste like vanilla this is my better than tasting like liquid sugar in fact I have one version works that have been other things in weho the sugar because that's even nicer as crunch time sexually and then one that I do cook over more often yeah you can save your hands that's for a show of hands as to who likes what this wide you're blind don't get the heavens your hands are born city so greater influence so do you will see the huge difference between the three who likes the blue best blue green raised the green okay Israel who likes the red best I college to read but that's or little ice the white this okay White's the one drew and what I find most remarkable about it is that it melts in your mouth take another bite you'll see what I mean", "7WaFX9ZRqCE": "Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. There are so many cake recipes out there its unbelievable. But there is one cake recipe that is requested time and time again. So join me today as i make my version of an angel food cake. We are going to start by sifting our flour and we want to do it three times. Now i have already done it once so the second time and the third time out it in the bowl Then  with the sifter sift through which removes the lumps and air rates the flour Now do it once more so its a total of three times Next we are going to use egg white, now this is one and a half cups of egg whites which worked out to about twelve regular sized eggs and what i've done is let it sit here at room temperature for about an hour that's very important make sure it's not\ncold out of the fridge, make sure its at room temperature so pour the egg whites into a mixing bowl and of course when it comes to eggs white make sure the bowl is completely clean. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer we are going to beat these up just until the start to froth up As you can see their all nice and frothy now. So to that add in one teaspoon of cream of tartar Now you will be asking do i need to cream of tartar and the simple answer is yes you do need\nthe cream of tartar. Simply because the cream of tartar is what helps stabilise the egg whites especially while in the oven So if you don't know where to buy cream of tartar in your country Just google it and I'm sure you will find a local stockist and to that add in half a teaspoon of\nsalt and now we are going to continue to beat these until soft peaks form We are now at that soft peak stage where you pull up the whisk you see how it creates that peak right there So at this stage we are going to continue beating but what i have is one and a half cups of super fine sugar or caster sugar so what we are going to do is while its beating add in a little at a time just until we have added it all and its\ncompletely incorporated so its done just like so As you can see it is a nice and glossy look and thats exactly how you want it The egg whites are almost completely beaten through so to that add in one tablespoon of vanilla extract and half a teaspoon of almond extract and mix it through until its combined so finally what we are going to do with our flour mixture we are going to put in a quarter at a time and fold it through we don't want to mix it because we want to keep all that air in the egg whites so just fold it through once its well combined do another quarter than another quarter just until its all done For the final step we are going to use a baking dish and this one is referred to as an angel food cake tin what makes it special is it has the middle section here but is also comes out just like so and thats exactly what you want. Now one very important thing is what ever you do, do not grease the inside of the tin so no oil not butter no nothing so its just a simple matter of grabbing our mixture and pouring it into the tin so once its in the tin just spread it out. Just so its all nice and uniform So once done we are going to\nplace it into a preheated oven at a hundred and eighty degrees celsius for forty five\nminutes I am about to take the cake out of the oven and what I'm going to use is a glass bottle just like so and this is what we are going to use the hang the cake on upside down so what we do is with the booze bottle glass bottle, put that in the middle and invert it so its upside down. Just like that. Now the reason why were going to do it this way is simply we are going to let it cool down and an hour and a half and having it upside down will prevent it from falling in on its self and it will stay nice and full and fluffy. So out angel cake has completely cooled down. Now unfortunately it has slightly sunk but its only a very small amount so its nothing to worry about but you do have to be carful to not over\nmix the meringue because one time when i over mixed the meringue this cake literally halved in size so be very careful not to over mix it but its only a slight drop so its perfectly fine so now with a flat blade knife what we are going to do is just cut up around the edges to loosen it up and then in that center so it should just rise up just like that and look at that so all we have to do is just cut it away from the base and one final step just to pretty it up some more i have some icing sugar confectioner sugar and I'm just sprinkling that on top One final tip when cutting it up, just use a serrated knife because it is a light and fluffy cake so you don't want to push down hard just keep on sawing away and looked at that now look how fluffy that is it looks fantastic now lets give this a try now thats fantastic it is a very sweet cake the texture is very very fluffy it really is in-between a meringue a pavlova and a normal cake but when you put the textures of the\nmeringue and the cake together this angel food cake tastes simply delicious and as always if you do do it please put up a photo on my Facebook page because i love seeing how people go with my recipes. but until then thank you for watching this episode of Todd's

going to make a fuss free cake something you can make in the last you know minutes you want to have something sweet to eat and and this is easy simple you don't even have to grease your bundt or to pan that you put it in pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees in the bowl I have one box of angel food cake mix and I don't want to hear any because this is good okay it doesn't hurt to use a cake mix I use Betty Crocker because this is my I've baked a lot of cakes from mixes and you know added here and there Betty Crocker to me and I they don't pay me this is the best cake mix so I've got a box of angel food cake mix going into the bowl [Applause] I've got a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple juice and all going into the bowl [Music] get all that pineapple out I don't know why it all didn't fall out when I was dumped it but it didn't and and I'm looking for an old Betty Crocker cookbook if any of you know where I can find one please let me know in the comments now I'm gonna mix all this together and I found out that people have been ordering off my wish list but I haven't been getting their items so I called Amazon this is the third time and and it took three times for somebody to be able to help me they've been ordering I don't receive it and it's because somehow my address went missing so they couldn't send it so I've got that fixed just in case you were one of those people and I appreciate it so much all right this is mixed now I'm putting mine into a tube pan I'm just gonna dump it in my goodness part of it didn't get mixed and I thought it did there we go I'm not gonna fool with turning this to pan around because the batter will follow the shape of the pan there we go oh gosh it smells so good so you're not following any of the directions that's on the box you're gonna do just what I've done exactly as I have done this is the only two ingredients the cake mix and the 20 ounces of crushed pineapple excuse my dogs y'all excuse my dog all right I got this in here spread it down a little bit get every last bit of it off though spatula now my crushed pineapple work was in in its own juice but if you use the heavy cream or heavy juice syrup that's that's up to you and the recipe that I saw did not specify okay all right this is going in the middle rack 350 degree oven for an hour when that happens we'll be back guys we're back and the first thing I want to tell you is that I misspoke about the amount of time cooked it is 40 to 45 minutes now mine took 50 minutes because it said when the top gets a dark golden brown it's done and I did test it with a cake tester now the next step and the last step is you have to let it cool on a rack upside down for two hours Tyranno a knife around the outside of it although I'm not sure the directions didn't mean after it cooled so it could be either way so there it is for two hours we'll be back when that when the time is up guys we're back here's the cake and I can tell you right now do not go around the edges and loosen them before you turn the cake upside down don't do it this cake is probably half the size it should be because of that but it's totally cool and spongy but it would be so much better if I hadn't done that now the actual directions first of all I'm sorry about messing up the time allowed to cook it is not 60 minutes it was 40 to 45 minutes in the center of the oven but mine took 50 so it's you know I guess it just depends on your oven this is a angel food let me see I don't know how to get this so that it's a good picture wait a minute I want to get a good picture of it look at that and your food pineapple cake so simple to make so so simple let's get over here where Sam is most assume in a little bit right I haven't had angel food in a long time is it good delicious so moist that pineapple in there now I think you could probably spruce it up a bit if you put a little bit of coconut and some chopped nuts on top before you baked it or even after you baked it when you cut a slice you can put use that or you can just leave it plain you know that's delicious it really is of course I'm partial angel food cake that is so moist that pineapple deliciousness mmm can you

We are making cakes! That's right. We're making cake today. I am not a baker. I'm just telling you. I don't normally bake,\nbut I do make some things, and one of the things\nthat I'm going to make is angel food cake. I'm gonna try to make it\njust like my grandmother made (whoosh)\nbecause every time I went to my grandmother's house and say, (whoosh)\n\"Make the angel food cake. \"Use the orange, whatever you\ndo with the orange topping \"with some zest and some\nsugar and make it good.\" And I would eat the entire cake. So, I'm gonna make four of 'em. It's gonna be tasty, and\nwe're gonna go from there. So, let's hang out. Let's get going on this.\n(whoosh) (upbeat music)\nI'm gonna need to make my egg whites first, so you can go, and you can, you know, get a bunch of eggs and crack 'em and take the yolks, and you can go and have a lot\nof fun with that if you want. It's totally up to you, but if you're lazy, like I am. I just went down and got some egg whites. (whoosh)\nWe're gonna put that in a bowl.\n(liquid pouring) We're gonna take the cream of tartar, and we're gonna put that in there. Almond extract, and then\nthe vanilla extract. That's all gonna go in together. (whoosh)\nNow, we just need to beat it (mixer whirring)\nuntil it comes to a nice peak. (whoosh)\nYeah, see there's peaks. So, you don't want to over beat. What happens if you over\nbeat then it gets just... It just turns into mush again. So, cake flour. You gotta sift the cake flour,\nthe sugar, and the salt. Put the salt in there. Let's put that in here. Fine.\n(metal bowl clanking) And we gotta do it five times. You want it nice and thin and... And, again, I'm probably\n(metal bowl clanking) doing it all wrong, but I don't care. (upbeat music) (whoosh)\nAll right, so let's try combining these things. So, I've gotta take the dry ingredients, but we gotta blend the egg whites in with the dry ingredients. So, I'm gonna put all the dry ingredients in this big ass pot. Right? Take the egg whites, and we\ngotta slowly fold that in. Okay? You don't wanna like over do it. Any cake baker out\nthere's probably laughing at my ass right now, but that's okay. I don't care. I'm sure they're gonna come out just fine. We're just gonna have to cross\nour fingers today, folks. I am definitely doing\none at a time next time. I'm thinking, \"Oh, I'm gonna\nsave myself some time here, \"and I'm just gonna, you\nknow, do two at a time.\" (upbeat music) This was a little different\n'cause normally you would think, \"Put it in a hot oven.\" But, no, this one says,\n\"Put it in a cold oven.\" So, my oven's cold. I'm gonna stick it in there. I'm gonna drop the rack down a little bit because, otherwise, it gets too high. And I'm gonna put both of 'em in. 325 for about an hour. We're gonna find out how\nthese things turn out. Otherwise, I might be\nrunning down to the store and buying more supplies.\n(whoosh) (rock music)\nNow, we need to make the frosting. We've got a bunch of oranges. I got a ton of sugar. (whoosh)\nVery simple, very easy. This is probably the easiest frosting you're ever gonna make. So, you basically just put\nthis confection sugar in there. It's a lot of sugar. (whoosh)\nBut you know what? I'm making several cakes. The best thing to do is to do this first, and then get the juice out. Get that in there. (glass clinking)\nSee how that comes out? (rock music) All right, so there's two. I think this is pretty good actually. I think it's about the right consistency. (whoosh)\n(oven timer beeping) Okay, let's check out the cakes. Oh yeah, look at that. Oh, it looks good. Now, my next batch, I'm hoping I get 'em up a little higher. Up, these upside down like so. Now, I just gotta let\nthose guys cool down. (whoosh) (rock music) And let's see if we can slide that off. There we go. Look at that. I'm just gonna go on the top. (rock music) (whoosh) Okay, so that's our angel food cake. So, they came out great. They look awesome. I can't wait to taste 'em,\nbut they're going to a party, so I can't slice and dice into it. So, I'll have to do that later. Anyway, I'm fired up, can't wait. So, make yourself some angel food cake. I know your family will love it. It's amazing. So, just like grandma. Anyway, I'll see you next time. Dads that Cook. Go check out the recipe,\nand we'll see you around.

(rock music)", "RMAajHVMyds": "hi everyone today I'm going to be making a chocolate angel food cake so to start with you will need a tube pan and this is a 10 inch tube pan if you don't have one you can try to make it in a 10 inch round pan it may not rise to as greatest volume as the 2-pin but you could try it the oven is being preheated right now at 325 degrees Fahrenheit we're going to combine our dry ingredients first I'm going to be making chocolate angel food cakes so I have some cocoa powder here about a quarter of a cup that I'm going to sift into the flour mixture I'm using 1 cup of all-purpose flour today if I was making a white traditional angel food cake then I would use cake flour instead cake flour has been to leach so you will end up with a whiter more tender cake we need a total of one and a half cups of granulated sugar half of it is going to get mixed in with a flour mixture so I have 3/4 cup of granulated sugar here so I'm going to combine these three ingredients flour sugar and I'm going to give that a whisk and then I am going to sift in the cocoa powder just that there are some lumps then I see and then give it a final whisk to combine now the next ingredient is perhaps the star of the show angel food cakes are considered on shorten cakes which means they do not contain any fat and this cake also does not contain any chemical leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda so the leavening is really dependent on egg whites to separate egg whites sticks will separate easier if it comes straight from the refrigerator when it is full so the best way to do that is to use an ink separator something like this you would crack an egg into this and then this will hold the yolk while you collect the egg whites or this gadget you can squeeze it and draw out the egg yolk and then what you have remaining would be the egg white since egg whites will feed up better at room temperature the best thing to do is to rest your bowl of egg whites in a warm water bath for about half an hour rather than leaving the egg whites for an extended period of time on your countertop that would be much safer so right here we have separated 12 8 White's or if you want to go by the weight about a 125 gram measure fit whites so we're going to go ahead and put back into my stand mixer if you don't have a stand mixer you can use an electric hand mixer the best to beat up the egg white would be either in a glass bowl or a stainless steel bowl and you want to make sure that your bowl is very clean that there aren't any traces of fat or a yolk because any little bit of fat well prevent the volume of the Ignite from being produced so let's go ahead and put that in I'm also going to use my balloon whisk and it goes I'm also going to be adding half a teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of almond extract you can add vanilla extract if you prefer that or almond extract or a combination of both I just thought that with the chocolate flavoring the almond your goal very well and we're gonna start beating it until I guess frothy and then we will add the next ingredients really smell the almond extract so what we need to add now is one and a half teaspoons of cream of tartar and cream of tartar is an acid salt and the reason we add it into the egg white mixture is to maintain the stability of the egg whites especially when we're depending on it for leavening so we were at a point where the egg whites now have stiffened up quite a bit it's at the soft peak stage so we are going to continue beating and this is the time that we're going to be adding the 3/4 cup of granulated sugar and we'll add that slowly about 2 tablespoons at a time while the mixer continues to run [Music] so take a look at the egg whites now since adding the sugar they have gotten very glossy and when I pulled out the beater you can see now this is the stiff peak it stands very tall and then it droops slightly so we're at a point where the egg whites are ready and we're going to now add back the flour mixture so I like to sift it in to keep the mixture nice and light I'm going to add and with this right on top of the egg white and then I'm going to show you how to incorporate the flour mixture into the egg white and what we don't want to do is stir it vigorously we don't want to deflate the egg white we want to maintain all of the air that we have beaten into the egg whites because that is going to help the cake to have a high volume so we have all the flour sugar mixture sifted and now we are going to blend all of that into the egg white and you notice the motion down the middle come up the side and rotate the bowl and keep repeating that until you have the flour mixture well incorporated into your egg whites now the cake is ready to be put into the springform pan notice that the pin is ungreased and we don't want to grease the pan so that as the cake bakes it can climb up the sides of the pan for some support so the batter is now in the two pan and I cut through with the rubber scraper to make sure that there aren't any big air pockets in the batter and then and it goes into the oven for about 40 to 45 minutes and the test for doneness is when you press it lightly that it's going to spring back for you and the leavening for this cake is from the air that has been incorporated into the egg white and steam as the cake bakes beat well turn the liquid into steam so I wish you could smell the aroma in my kitchen right now I just took the cake out after baking for 45 minutes the way to cool this cake is to invert the to pan upside down this will prevent the cake from collapsing and flattening the top and as it cools the structure will set and we're going to leave it like this so the tweak is now cool and nice volume that we have to cut the cake it is best to use a serrated knife it's the presentation if you want to add a little bit of sugar to some very light dusting in the summertime I like to serve this with some fresh berries right now all we have are frozen berries", "D4idjBA3C14": "hi I'm Robin Benson welcome to chat time I had a birthday recently and my husband Eric made me my very favorite type of birthday cake it is a cocoa whipped cream angel food cake except he took it upon himself to make a couple of adjustments to it which worked fine with me so I want to share it with you [Applause] a cocoa angel food cake goes back to generations of my husband's family mom Bensley made this all the time for the kids birthdays and it's continued on through my kids all you do is you take a packaged angel food cake mix and you replace two tablespoons of the cake flour part with two tablespoons of cocoa you know the dried cocoa powder and then you bake it according to directions of course you let it cool down completely and you know this lovely light cocoa flavored angel food cake and there's two things I love about angel food cake anyway first there's no fat in it I'm not counting the icing and also you don't have to grease the pan I love those two things about it and it's so light and spongy and fluffy and so now I'm gonna make the special whipped cream frosting okay we're going to need about three cups of cold heavy whipping cream all right now here's a little trick my husband showed me because every time they make whipping cream no matter how much all the cupboards and the tiles and everything gets splattered all over the place I have it all over the front of myself so he taught me to do this you put the ball in a sink and then you whip it until soft peaks form all right those are soft peaks notice the splatters in the sink all contained I'm gonna add three things and two tablespoons of sugar one heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder and two tablespoons of instant coffee crystals [Music] and we just blend them in for a minute until stiff peaks form [Music] in there I'll bring this over my cake I always start with the hole first spread some around in there then you just frost the whole cake [Music] [Applause] and then here's what my thoughtful husband did for decorations decorate it with one of my favorite candies of all times melted milk balls you can put whatever you want on there he actually spelled by name and malted milk balls was a little hard to read now I don't even need to take a bite of this for you because I just finished a couple days ago the last of the original birthday cake and it's fabulous it's so light and airy and move the coffee but the cocoa is wonderful together and you know actually what am I gonna do with a whole other birthday cake well I guess I have lucky neighbors [Music]", "VRpc0BynzTY": "hi I'm Angie and today I'm making an angel food cake I've preheated the oven to 325 degrees and I've got a tube pan ready to go you do not want to grease your to pan you want an ungreased to pan and I'm going to start by sifting together some dry ingredients I've got three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour a quarter cup of cornstarch and three quarters of a cup of sugar and I'm going to sift those together with the sieve here just shake it through and I'm going to do that three times switch the bowl and she get through the sieve again you want this to be very nice and fine and one more time okay that's good and I'm going to set this aside okay now I'll bring in the electric mixer and I've got the beater attachment on it and in the bowl I'm going to add one and a half cups of egg white and that's equal to about a dozen eggs and what I do is when I make a custard or something like that and I have leftover egg whites all freeze them and when I have enough to make an angel food cake or chiffon cake then I pull them out let them thaw in the refrigerator and I can use those if your egg whites are cold from your refrigerator you want to bring them to room temperature and a quick way to do that is to just set the measuring cup for the bowl that you have them in in another bowl of warm water and just let them sit there for a couple minutes and they'll warm up and I'm just going to sprinkle one-and-a-half teaspoons of cream of tartar over the surface of the egg whites as well as three quarters of a teaspoon of salt and I'll beat these with the whisk until they are stiff but not dry okay so you can see that they're holding their peaks but they're not dry they're still nice and moist now with the mixer turned back on i'm going to gradually blend in two thirds of a cup of granulated sugar and i'll keep eating that until it forms stiff peaks and I'll also add three quarters of a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract okay okay that looks good so I can take it off of the mixer okay now i'm going to fold in the dry ingredients about a third at a time okay when that's all folded in i'm going to gently put that into my 10-inch to pan and remember you don't want to grease it I'm going to bake this at 325 for about 50 minutes and then increase the temperature to 375 fahrenheit for about another 10 minutes you just want to give it that little extra baking time until when you touch it with your fingers on the top it kind of springs back okay I'm just going to smooth out the top with an offset spatula and I'll pop this in the oven at 325 for about 50 minutes and then I'll increase the temperature to 375 for another 10 minutes and then I'll show you what we do with the cake when we take it so pop this in the oven and we'll continue on when I take it out okay so it's been an hour total baking time and the cake is done looks and smells great now the fun part is you want to cool it completely not on a rack but upside down so you don't want the crust to touch anything so the best way to do that is to use a bottle like a wine bottle works perfectly and just invert the cake right on top of the bottle just balance it there and just let it cool completely just like that that will keep it nice and fluffy and full and it won't collapse on itself so once it's cooled completely you'll run a knife around it and invert it onto a cake plate and it will be amazing I'll show you a photo of the finished cake and a slice of it so you can see how light and fluffy it is you can go to

you", "ddNhML4HVEc": "hi welcome to lynn's recipes today I'm going to make an angel food cake the amount of the ingredients that you're going to need to make this cake will be listed in the information box below or you can find it on the website the ingredients are you will need egg whites and these are at room temperature you'll need sugar and I've divided it you'll need cake flour cream of tartar salt vanilla extract and almond extract you're also going to need to preheat your oven to 350 degrees and you will need an angel food cake pan and it is ungreased the first thing you need to do start this recipe is you need to separate your eggs now I have separated mine in this bowl and I have kept the whites in this bowl and put the egg yolks in the refrigerator and you can use us for something else you will not need them for this recipe you're going to need to let your egg whites it on your counter until they come to room temperature the next thing we need to do is to sift our flour and I'm going to sift a half a cup of sugar and my cake flour together and I'm going to do this three times take flag Adam and my sugar I'm just going to start sifting don't want any lumps in this so that's one time and now I'm just going to simply set back in the other bowl and this will be too this is the third time ok now I'm going to set this aside and then we'll move on the next step is to beat the egg whites I'm going to put them in my mixer along with my salt in my cream and tartar the vanilla extract and the almond extract and I'm just going to beat this on a medium speed until I have soft peaks okay so this has soft piece and this is kind of what you want it to look like so now I'm going to put this deck on I matter mom makes your back on we're going to add the sugar rest of the sugar about two tablespoons at a time okay that looks really good so now I'm going to take this off my stand mixer here looks like and now if I'm going to do is I'm going to fold in the flour mixture and I'm going to do it about half at a time and we do this with a spatula by hand so you don't deflate the egg whites I'm going to add the rest i'll continue to fold till it's all mixed together I finish folding in my flower so now i'm going to put it into my prepared pan and really all you do is just this hand has a bottom that comes out you just put it in no grease you don't read slower anything this paint it just needs to be like that so here we go it all around you want to move your rack in your oven to the bottom part of your oven to bake this so now I'm just going to take this knife and run it through here just to get rid of any of the air bubbles at my EMF okay just going to smooth the top a little bit more now I'm going to put this in the oven and let it bake for 35 to 40 minutes the angel food cake cooked for 40 minutes I just took it out of the oven now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this pan I'm going to turn it upside down it has to cool upside down completely before you take it out of the pan this pan has little feet as you can see so I'm going to do it this way if you have an angel food cake pin that doesn't have fee what you can do is take a coca-cola bottle a wine bottle or anything that has a small spout and you can turn your pan upside down with the little tube over the spouts let it cool completely and then we'll move on to the next step which is removing it from the pan my angel food cake has been sitting upside down and it's completely cool and now it's time to remove it from the pan I'm going to turn it back over and I'm going to take my night and we're going to run it around the middle and the outside okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to lift it out of the pan take my knife and I'm going to run it under here so now I'm going to just turn it off the here I'm going to put it on a cake plate now when you're cutting angel food cake you're going to want to use a serrated knife so I'm going to cut a piece and show you what it looks like here we go and I'm going to serve this with some fresh strawberry this also makes really good strawberry shortcake so this is angel food cake I hope you enjoy it you", "kt0y2fiFlys": "[Music] hey guys it's angel the holidays are here and it is one of my favorite times of the year there's the Christmas tree the festive decorations and let's not forget the desserts I don't know why I always feel like holidays mean lots of dessert making and lots of dessert eating so this holiday season I've partnered with Amazon to not only help me decorate for the holidays but I'm also going to show you guys how to make some holiday desserts in two different kitchen appliances that Amazon sent me from their holiday home gift guide the first kitchen appliance I got was an austere air fryer now I was super excited to try this out because you can get the crispy texture and flavors of fried food using only a tablespoon of oil or less and that makes cooking deep fried food healthier now today I'm going to show you guys how to make a angel food cake dessert in the airfryer and if you need another reason to like this dessert just know that this angel food cake is fat-free the second kitchen appliance I got was an 8 quart instant pot now the 8 quart size is really great for families it's probably best known as a pressure cooker but you can do other things like slow cook make yogurt cook fluffy rice and even make desserts so today I'm gonna be making a creme brulee in the instant pot and since we have all the ingredients ready to go in the kitchen let's head over there and get started so the first recipe I'm going to be making is a 10 minute angel food cake now I say 10 minutes because that's how long it's going to take to cook in this austere air fryer so have that Webster air fryer right here and if you haven't seen one of these before it's got a cooking basket right here and this is the cooking basket so this is where we're gonna put our cake today or this is where you can put your food and then you just slide that back in like this then you've got the temperature control knob above that we've got anywhere from 175 degrees to 400 degrees and finally at the top there's a timer now the great thing about this austere air fryer is that it cooks similar to a convection oven so everything's gonna cook quickly and evenly and for this recipe since we are going to be cooking at 325 degrees I am going to set the temperature dial to 325 degrees and then I'm gonna preheat this air fryer for 10 minutes and now that this is preheated let's start cooking for this recipe we'll need four egg whites at room temperature so earlier I just set out my eggs on the counter one to two hours beforehand next in a large mixing bowl I am separating four egg whites into the bowl and I'm gonna save the egg yolks separately for my next recipe then add a pinch of salt and with a hand mixer I'm going to start out slow and beat the egg whites on low and if you're wondering the egg whites need to be at room temperature for them to whip up properly once it starts to look frothy and foamy I'm going to add half a teaspoon of cream of tartar and once that's combined I'm going to add half a teaspoon of vanilla extract at this point I'm going to start increasing the speed of my mixer to medium and when things start to look like runny marshmallows I'll increase the speed to medium high until I get soft peaks and once you get to soft peaks add in 1/4 cup of Baker sugar a bit at a time and continue mixing in at a reduced medium speed once the sugar is combined you want to stop beating when the mixture hits medium peaks and that looks like this next measure out a quarter cup of sifted cake flour and gradually fold in the flour a bit at a time with a spatula now be careful not to stir as you still want the air bubbles in the mixture to keep the cake nice and fluffy once the mixture is combined I'm going to transfer them to these mini cake pans and if you guys are interested I'll post a link to these pans in the video description and also the recipe ingredients after filling each pan even out the tops with a spatula then run a knife through the batter to help remove any negative spaces that might be in there at this point my air fryer is preheated and I'm going to place one cake pan into the air for our basket and set the dowel to cook for 10 minutes after 10 minutes your angel food cakes should be a nice and golden brown I'm just going to let this one cool while I cook the next cake pan after both cakes have cooked and have cooled for a couple hours you can go ahead and run a knife on the outside of the cake pan they gently remove your angel food cake and when you're done your angel food cakes should look like this now I like to serve these with a scoop of whipped cream and seasonal fruit or you can make mini cakes with whipped cream frosting in the center and holiday decorations on the top [Music] next up since we have a lot of egg yolks left over I'm going to be testing out a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e recipe in this instant pot now this instant pot came with a lot of different accessories there was this stainless steel steaming rack with handles which is really handy to lift in and out and it also came with a rice paddle soup spoon measuring cup and a recipe booklet now I'm actually gonna be using a modified version of the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e recipe in this booklet to accommodate for the number of eggs we have leftover so with that let's get started for the creme brulee I'm going to measure out 1 and 1/3 cups of cream then in a small pot or pan for cooking add the cream a pinch of salt and three tablespoons of cane sugar next turn your stove on low as we'll want to gently heat and stir the mixture so the sugar dissolves and the cream just starts to form small bubbles on the side of your pot once that's done turn off the heat and set the mixture aside to cool and while that's cooling in a large mixing bowl I'm adding in four egg yolks we saved from the previous recipe and two teaspoons of vanilla extract gently mix the yolks and the vanilla with the whisk to combine keeping in mind to mix and not whip next pour a small amount of cream into the mixing bowl while stirring quickly to temper the egg yolks after tempering you can now safely add in the remaining cream [Music] now to make things easier I'm gonna transfer the liquid into a mixing Cup so I can easily pour the cream into smaller ramekins and to make the creme brulee smoother I'm going to strain the liquid through a sieve once you have your ramekins filled cover them tightly with a small piece of aluminum foil and now it's time to set up the instant pot I'm pouring one cup of water into the instant pot then with the Handy steaming rack and gently lower the ramekins into the bottom of the pot now close the lid and seal the instant pot taking care to make sure that the top vent is set to sealing so no steam escapes then I'm going to set my instant pot to pressure cook on low pressure with a 13-minute cook time and afterwards a 13 minute natural release once they're done cooking take the ramekins out and remove the foil the creme brulee should jiggle a bit in the center when you tap all the sides of the container and that's when you know it's done once they're cool completely refrigerate for a few hours to set and when you're ready for some dessert spin some cane sugar over the tops of the custard using more if you want a thicker crust or less if you like a thinner one and caramelize the tops with a kitchen torch and for the record caramelizing with a torch is one of my favorite parts of making this dessert once the tops have cooled and hardened your creme brulee is now ready to eat tap the tops and gently with a spoon and don't forget to savor each and every creamy bite [Music] and that is how you make desserts in both the instant pot and the airfryer now it's time for the taste test searches my favorite part of the video I'm gonna start with the angel food cake first a little bit of cake and of course some fresh strawberries that is amazing the angel food cake came out super light and fluffy and I love the pairing with just a little bit of sweetened whipped cream and the fresh fruit next we have the creme brulee I'm gonna crack the tops first I love that sound mmm Wow that is amazingly creamy this is really good for an instant bought creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e recipe the one thing that I would say is that I probably use smaller ramekins because this is so addicting that I wouldn't want to eat too much so both desserts turned out really good and if you guys are looking for a little help in the kitchen this holiday season don't forget to check out Amazon's holiday home gift guide the instant pot and the airfare both make great gifts and also a big thank you to Amazon for helping me decorate I got my tree my Christmas garland some holiday cards and other holiday items delivered right to my door so that was super convenient anyways I'm angel I hope you guys enjoyed today's video if you did give me a thumbs up and also don't forget to subscribe to my youtube channel right here until then take care guys happy holidays stay warm and I will see you in the next one bye [Music] you", "AgAR1uJe5ow": "hi my name is Karen stiegler and today I'm here talking to you about healthy baking and showing you how to make a fat-free lemon angel food cake so we just got done beating our whites to Pete stiff pink they're ready to go with the sugar and everything in them and now we're going to add our vanilla and for vanilla just buy a good quality vanilla a real vanilla extract don't buy artificial artificials made from lots of not-so-great things from one of them is from wood pulp so you don't want wood pulp in your dessert so most grocery stores have a real vanilla extract that you can buy and it's it's expensive for a bottle but you just use a tiny bit at a time so it's worth the investment so we have the vanilla here and we're just going to add this in and then I'm going to just whisk it up to blend that in ok okay and then the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to transfer it over to the bigger bowl because my mixer bowl is a little bit small to do the final combining so now one word of caution when you have your whisk you don't want to whack your whisk on your bowl because you will lose all that lovely froth that you got from beating the egg whites so just remember don't hit your spatula or your beater on there and if any didn't get mixed in you can just kind of smooth it in it will get mixed in because we have several other ingredients to add okay so you can see how soft and velvety and thick and delicious it looks now once you learn how to master and how to do this beating of the egg whites this is the base for all sorts of fat free desserts there's meringues marshmallows are made from this there are many types of icings or frosting that are made with beaten egg whites so it's really good thing to know and it's all very similar okay so we have our egg whites here now the last flavor ingredient of course is lemon so I want to talk about that for a minute you want to choose a lemon that is smooth has a nice surface is free of blemishes and if you want you can buy organic this might be a time when you'd want to since we're using just the peel of the lemon but it's okay if you can't get it you can use a conventionally grown lemon but when you get it home make sure you scrub it and clean it with a vegetable brush before you use it wash it off so I have here two graders this is a microplane zester or greater and this is a regular sort of greater that you would typically have I really recommend the microplane it gives you very thin wispy pieces of the lemon rinds it's really nice but if you don't have that you don't have to go out and buy something new you can just use your regular grader so today I'm going to use the microplane and you just want to get the outside layer the really yellow part of the lemon that's where all the essential oils are and that's where a lot of the lemon flavor comes from and we don't want to get any of the white pith so this this zester grater does a really good job so I'm just going to do it right over the ball here so I just turn it as I go and I can see that the lemon zest is coming off in the bowl and it's also coming off my lemon and also you can see it here on the backside of the lemon zester so it's really nice now this is a really great lemon because we're not seeing a lot of white here so we're doing a good job so we just want to continue to go around and it's quite a bit of lemon zest in this recipe it's about one-and-a-half teaspoons you can do this over a cutting board if you'd rather and then just transfer the lemon zest okay so I'm not really measuring here today you could do this on a cutting board and then you could measure it out alright so I've got my lemons that's there and then I want to just fold it in ok so the for the folding you want to use a big spatula like this rubber or plastic and you don't want to stirring or a quick motion you just want to go around the bowl and then turn the egg whites over themselves ok and then you can keep turning your bowl and you want to kind of scoop down the middle once in a while ok and then that will also get incorporated when we're going to add in our flour so we've got our vanilla in we got our lemon zest in for flavoring and now we've got our mixture that we reserved with our cake flour sifted with our half a cup of sugar four times so it's really light and fluffy now we don't want to just dump this whole amount in because that would also push down all that air that we got in the egg whites so I'm going to go back to my sister over here and I want to just pick this up and we're going to do it a quarter of the dry mixture at a time so first I'm going to put about a quarter you can just guess it's not really thinking about that not really specific and then we're going to sip this over to beat an egg whites okay so once again use your sector and then we're going to fold that in so you can see that all these things really have the goal of keeping the cake light and fluffy and we use that cake flour we sift it a lot so you want to just you don't have to overly mix it in we're going to do some four parts and then I also have my little bit that's all my paper over here so kind of mix that in and I want to just mix this last bit of flour until it's just mixed you don't want any pockets of flour in the batter but we don't want to overdo it either because we want to keep all our nice egg whites so I'm just going to cut through the middle kind of scrape the bottom just go slow and easy on this so now we've got our lemon and our vanilla totally mixed in and our dry ingredients have been sifted in and we're ready to put it in the 10 inch tube pan so next I'll show you how to put it in the pan and how to bake the cake to watch the other segments in this video series or for how to videos on almost any other topic visit monkey-see calm", "zpjdB_FWHpU": "hello world this is sugar quarter since angel food cake day is coming up I decided to make some pumpkin angel food cake so I got this recipe from Food Network and it's pretty good all I did was use a regular angel food cake recipe and added a little bit of pumpkin puree in a mixing bowl I added the wet ingredients first then I added the dry ingredients and it makes everything well together and for the record this is my first time making angel food cake and I'm pretty sure I did it wrong however practice makes progress so maybe next time my angel food cake will turn out better as for now the version that I made in this video still tasted pretty good have you made angel food cake before if so what kind of flavored angel food cake did you make the list of ingredients to this recipe is in the video description once the mixture is completely mixed while I poured it into a baking pan then had tapped it the baking pan a couple times to pop any large air bubbles before baking the pumpkin angel food cake in a oven after I removed the pumpkin angel food cake from the oven I let it cool completely before cutting out pumpkin like shapes using the closest cookie cutter I could find that resembles like a pumpkin to decorate these pumpkin angel food cakes I used writing gel and sanding sugar that I got at the dollar store surprisingly they are pretty good quality and it definitely saved me time from making the icing from scratch since Halloween is right around the corner do you have any Halloween recipe requests and also are you planning on going trick-or-treating with your kids or family
