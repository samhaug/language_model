{"9KZh-eoOaB8": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier i'm your host andrew friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of cannabis reviews today we have a cool new vape pen from that great legalization 2.0 category of extracts uh really cool company collab project um really enjoying a bunch of things they're putting out they're not an lp they're a processor they're a brand they're a purchaser what they're trying to do is get great things out to market they're not necessarily trying to grow the cannabis which in turn i kind of appreciate so i believe these guys operate under dose cans license um but use the collab project branding i know they do have a standalone store in saskatchewan which is pretty cool where saskatchewan you're able to do your own business directly with the lps and you can have much more specific products in your store and have different pricing agreements and all these other things if you have any questions about that leave it in the comments and maybe i'll go into it a little bit deeper and explain but why did i want to do collab project sativa 1.0 because this is the first one gram cart on market 85 and you get an entire gram super cool when i was reading this is ethanol distillate it's decent distillate i guess 850 milligrams of thc in the one gram extract uh there is this flavor profile is supposed to be strawberry ice um thinking back i don't know if i've ever actually had strawberry ice cannabis so an interesting pick as the flavor profile especially for a sativa and then i also read on the ontario canvas store website that it is mercen dominant so for a sativa to be mercy dominant is why we really don't talk too much about indica sativa in my world because mercy and as we know when inhaled does create more permeability in the blood-brain barrier and one of those reasons why indica or mercy and dominance strains tend to leave you feeling a little bit more intoxicated again if you want to know more about that just leave a comment i'm happy to discuss so collab project has their own battery these are the guys that make the batteries for sherbinsky in the states what i liked about it why i thought i should just even mention it is because it has this cool charger where you don't have to take your cart out and i know that's a big beef with me with the other ones that you have to screw in take your card out so it's quite a bit thicker and i have heard that these carts are a little bit wider as well but pretty cool one gram cart i think i should stop talking and we should dive into it hopefully you agree you can see we still have our duty seal there i think i mentioned these are around 80 85 for the one gram of distillate strawberry ice flavor and let's bust into this and see what we got oh i should see if there's anything else on here cannabis extracts strong cool derived place equivalent to four grams of dried cannabis so that's you know great you can carry around seven of these i'm doing my math right quickly and there's our packaging date and our lot number just so everybody can see it now let's dive in break that duty seal and these are pretty nice they're pinch here a pinch here and i believe these boxes are biodegradable as long as you take the sticker off which again is a pretty nice thought to just think about and there is our cart there's our box i don't think we need the box anymore do you [ __ ] there's our cart looking slick very heavy very heavy in my hand um well i have a scale right here let's weigh it because it does weigh quite a bit it feels very premium in my hand really nice thick big guy i was told that this doesn't work with the vessel battery with the top on but you can take the top off and use it so we'll experiment with that as well 20 grams is what this pen weighs and just for contrast let's look at an old empty one just to see okay so quite a bit of weight we know that there's only one gram of distillate in here but very very heavy in weight contrast super cool like how it looks nice very yellow color looks like good distillate you can see that the bubble doesn't move at all which again is one of those pieces of the silver market the gray market that a lot of people use for an indication of quality on the amount of filler diluting anything in there to see how quickly that bubble moved and the viscosity that was actually inside of this pet so i guess now without further ado we strap it on and we taste it so here's my cool collab battery let's see how this spins on shall we we got our nubbin on the bottom knob and on the top i really like this top piece it feels very sturdy i don't know if it's ceramic or what it might be but it feels great there we go we're all linked in and apparently this pen is optimized for this battery or for this cart so let's check it out no heat settings just an auto pull i wonder if there's a light [Music] okay big rip um it to me right away had some quite mentholy flavors yeah a lot of sweet mint is what i'm getting actually and maybe that's that strawberry ice flavor profile that ice is definitely um relatable to menthol i guess you could see some medicinal kind of cherry properties as well in inside of uh the mentholness but it's definitely the menthol that leaves for me kind of tastes like um the chiller strawberry gum the dentine ice uh cherry gum is what i would relate it to it's not off-putting but it is a little bit medicinal for me um but i'm sure there's lots of people that would really like this flavor profile so distill it looks clean doesn't stink coming out of it let's try with the vessel quick before we uh before we disappear from this video and give it a final review got our vessel vape battery and we know well i know because i was told that it doesn't fit there because it is a larger more premium cart but you can always take that piece off of your vessel and you can screw this down like so like so and you can still use the battery that way so let's try to one two three four five oh and this is on red so i don't want it on red and that's blue that's the lightest setting so let's try this one more time with our vessel battery nice big rip same flavor well it gets me that's a good one on the vessel i feel like i got a bigger rip because i could just press that button and i wasn't relying on myself pull super cool and again this battery comes with a charger that you don't have to take your cart out of you just twist it in like that pretty cool liked it um like that it's a gram like the premium feel feel of the entire pen and a little bit larger stature of it all in all um i guess we break it down with the carts because i can't smell it there isn't really a mark there so i'm just going to give it out of 10 you can relate it into the 100 points but for me i think you know the flavor is all right but it's not crazy it is a distillate pen um so i guess just on grade based on my knowledge of cannabis for products that are similar to this i think it's a good product um you know i think i think it's shooting just shy of an 8 out of 10. let's call that 79. we're going to call it 79 points out of 100. the taste was all right but i'm definitely going to give the taste uh a 75 mark based on other pens on market i think this absolutely wamps them the fact that there's a gram in it the price point is pretty good um pulls nicely i like that they have a battery that goes along with it so yeah let's give it 79 points out of 100 7.9 out of 10 uh pretty good if they could get those terps on point and maybe it's just me a more appealing flavor for me then i would love it but it pulls strong it's a big load everything about it's quite good so thank you so much for watching hope you make sure to like comment share and subscribe until next week cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis sommelier", "sfc5PCWjbRI": "what's up guys this is desi flav wife coming at you from pompano beach wait

fridge and do our thing all right jesse take us away here all right rosie's already digging into the big block of uh cheese from costco cheddar cheese baby that's the cheddar dubliner yeah yeah okay so one of my favorite things in the fridge currently are this pecan butter it's unbelievable i mean first of all clean ingredients of course and this one is a sweet potato pie pecan butter it's just so creamy and delicious i mean it's like almond butter but way better i see the ingredients yeah so what we got pecans dehydrated sweet potato dehydrated maple syrup vanilla powder cinnamon sea salt that's a cool company from georgia beautiful and we have some of those in costco in the south too smear that on a toast in the morning wow so good another favorite thing wow oh gaga for this thing coconut cult they have ice creams and and lately they've come out with this probiotic coconut yogurt that is insane look at those ingredients it's i'm literally obsessed 25 billion probiotics so they recommend taking it easy in the beginning you can take it easy it's so good it's crazy they have one that's chocolate it's out of bounds it's so good [Laughter] it's hard to find though yeah also another thing that i love are the san marzano tomatoes we use them all the time my mom makes a lot of bulgarian stews and especially cabbage stews lately and she mashes those tomatoes in the stew they turn out delicious and they're so good that sometimes i make a tomato juice out of them i just buzz them with the stick blender add a little bit of salt and water and i i drink that as tomato juice i usually have it maybe with a toast with the cheese or something word for turkey turkey we also get this one from costco and we make epic sandwiches and the on the cauliflower thins yep keto turkey sandwiches yeah amazing let's just fall out of the package making her own sandwich she's never buy the fridge so she's having a great time and then another thing that we eat all the time is the sauerkraut yeah and rose loves it too it's great to introduce that to little ones as well i started introducing this to rose when she was about like about 10 months old or so it's fermented though that's that's that's that's the best fermented naturally fermented sauerkraut very important just salt and cabbage that's it so you gotta watch out for that don't get the ones that are shelf stable because they have vinegar in them okay well uh i think bobby wants to take it over from here hey rose i'm actually gonna start with the almond milk because if you can see this almond milk it's super rich and creamy and i talk about this all the time you really want to avoid the almond milk with all the gums and emulsifiers and gels elmhurst from thrive market and the thrive market brand are two of my favorite shelf stable ones that i use for smoothies all the time this has no emulsifiers this only has one most in the grocery store have three to four and they're vitamin fortified those are fantastic because they have four to five times the amount of almonds per cup than like a silk or one you find at the grocery store load up on that when you click my link down below for 25 off your first thrive order get the almond milk either elmhurst or thrive market is fantastic jesse talked about putting the pecan butter on toast we're literally eating this every day it's a little bit of a healthy habit right but this keto bread from base culture a florida based woman-owned company cinnamon raisin and cheese bread you always always see me talk about the ones you don't want to get in the store this is the kind you want to get i mean these ingredients are amazing no process no refined oils no gluten no wheat the ingredients the macros this is fantastic now it's a whoa chug-a-lug duggy it's a little pricey i think i do have a 20 off uh flav city uh promo code on their website filler up barkeep rose isn't joking here it is saturday afternoon it is saturday after all okay um also in here what i love siete makes the most amazing paleo burritos bigger than rose's head but normally burritos are made from wheat and gluten these are once again paleo cause they're cassava flour based but avocado oil the key is you have to heat these in a very large comal or like a cast iron pan how good are those burritos we're making lately we're making breakfast burritos that are too legit to quit they're just absolutely fantastic um what else is in here so this is in here we're going to a barbecue this afternoon this is what i'm calling the best pastries slow grown heirloom heritage breed want that bread roast chicken on the market and it's the thrive market pasture raised box this is pasture raised cook's venture chicken and heirloom or pasture raise is good but heirloom slow grown is even better i'm telling you the texture and flavor of this chicken now breasts are great but i have the whole um spatchcock chicken and i have um the chicken uh wings is amazing i've been talking about them so much they're sold out currently on their website but go on their site click remind me like carrie underwood remind me when that chicken box comes in stock it's about 770 a pound but with 25 off using my promo link down below it's under six dollars a pound every fan who's tried that has literally gone loco and la cabeza they love it okay nana here okay next course for rose here we go there you go sweetie yes yes [Music] tortillas nuts what else real quickly in here this is such an underrated condiment people don't know about harissa theresa is a north african pepper spread and mina is such a cool company look at these ingredients it's actually made with extra virgin olive oil i talk about it in my new cookbook because it's a great store-bought ingredient and we do tons of stuff with that she was just storing her almond milk in the little cubby hole in the fridge right here now she's coming back to it oh my god rose you are hilarious um and that's about it for the fridge let's go to the freezer real quick rose okay in the freezer i gotta clean up after rose here but this is honestly one of the most life-changing ice creams in the world and it's dairy free it's coconut bliss i got it it's sprouts and for some reason it's so hard to find but sprouts farmers market has it this is coconut bliss what is this chocolate walnut brownie but this one's even better this is chocolate peanut butter with the crazy face on the front look at these ingredients okay it's a little expensive it's about seven dollars a pint but best in class ingredients one of the only ice creams that don't use natural flavors and it's only 12 grams of added sugar per serving most ice cream steps here are like ice cream speaking of speaking of ice cream most ice creams are about this actually only has 2 grams of added are 18 to 20. this is not a moo which is not bad but coconut bliss is where it's at um here's what i was talking about this is the pasture raised thrive market chicken spatchcock meaning the bone the backbone is removed you can put the whole thing on the grill or oven crispy skin for the win this is amazing so make sure to uh get that using my link down below and uh i did try the thrive market 100 grass-fed um steak box didn't love it to be honest but it is very high quality and what else is here oh i keep this always in the freezer this is pre-cooked frozen organic brown rice it's nice because it's already cooked so at a moment's notice you can have brown rice which normally takes about 45 minutes to cook you can have this and if you make a stir-fry or fried rice with this it's actually better than fresh rice because this is a bit dry and it will soak up and absorb the flavors of the pan when you cook in there um so that's what's in there rose let's do a check in with rose here rose how's the ice cream is it good and then last but not least over here does we installed this this week and tons of people are asking about it um this is our under counter reverse osmosis alkaline water filter so it's a three stage reverse osmosis but then it has alkaline minerals in here and it alkalizes the water to a 9 ph we're very big on that and then a lot of people keep asking me where to get it the thing is it's from a tiny shop in venice beach called um better water company it's very hard to like you can't even order online so i'm going to try to find one online that's just as good as this because this is fantastic and the water is so clean and has that nice alkaline balance a lot of people are asking about that um and i think that's it so that's what's in our fridge in our freezer right now um scoop that but also like i said this brand right here a lot of people asked when i showed the other day this a cure makes a super clean in the world of cosmetics it's very dirty conditioner and shampoo at whole foods it's 9.99 on thrivemarket.com it's 6.99 i think you're done with ice cream rose and we're done with the video that's what's in the pantry i'm sorry in the fridge and the freezer right now um we did have ice cream now it's a little less but that's actually very low in sugar so um uh that is it we have plenty

cream i'm not gonna watch mommy here you go", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "LDTmBvDWFL4": "flavor city family what is up it is bobby coming at you from the parking garage of aldi here in chicago the big new beautiful aldi cause we're

what to buy tell you what to avoid and why it's all about helping you guys get educated and buy the best quality stuff to put in your body and your family's body uh before we get in there and do our thing you know the drill like subscribe share there's so much content coming at you in 2021 there's a bell icon below the video enable the bell that way you get a push on your device as soon as we go live all right let's talk in more shopping let's go into aldi and do our thing the snack food aisle at aldi there's actually a couple really good finds here but look how wide the lanes are at this albeit this is so nice i said it before it's like the episode of seinfeld with elaine she's like ooh wide lanes how luxurious um one of the best sweet snacks to be honest on the market but also at aldi is on sale right now here oh it's not on sale i'm sorry this is really really good but look at this these are coconut cashew crisps and they're actually paleo so what are they they're made with amazing ingredients coconut coconut flour cashews cocoa powder cassava and sea salt so there's nine grams of added paleo coconut sugar but for eight pieces you only need a few pieces and it's about one gram per these taste great they're 2.99 they're paleo because of the coconut sugar and they taste great waldo which guy big thanks to brad there he's doing a security for the waldos this one's good but this one's even better this is the salted caramel which makes me nervous because they might use natural flavors or whatnot but look at the ingredients how do they get the salted caramel flavor see this coconut sugar in there coconut sugar has a lovely salty nutty caramely flavor so that's why they call it salted caramel i'm telling you if you want a healthy-ish paleo treat these are my favorite in aldi and probably almost any grocery store stay away from this because the vanilla unfortunately uses vanilla natural flavors which is another word for artificial flavors so we'll skip on that so they're sweet let's see a savory one so they have a couple interesting options here for jerky right a great protein snack for on the go this is the one you want to get and hello it's on sale right now for a dollar off this is beef biltong biltong is south african style jerky and there's no cruddy ingredients look at this it's actually sweetened with raisin juice concentrate uses beef added sugar is zero which means there's barely any raisin juice in there my only knock on this is that it's not grass-fed beef but i'll tell you why it's the best option here at aldi because if you go over here and you find this which when i first saw it a while back i was super excited right it's 100 grass-fed beef bobby said grass-fed beef is preferable i'm going to buy this and it's on sale too well bobby also said to read the ingredients here and unfortunately it is organic grass-fed beef and it has cane sugar keep going it has natural flavors has not more natural flavors and yeast extract which is a fancy word for msg and there's four grams of added sugar which is one teaspoon so nope we'll put that back ideally the grass-fed beef would go over here because these ingredients are great but in that situation you're going to want to go with the bill tong and i would run over to uh aldi right now because that price is great and there was one more thing here i wanted to oh right here look what's on sale man great sale items right now you guys these are the parm crisps all the version on sale i love these in all shapes and forms palm crisp parm wisps whatever store you get them at these are fantastic because they're the ultimate keto diabetic and gluten-free crisp it's just one ingredient h parmesan cheese aged cheddar cheese remember aged cheeses like these have no lactose so if you're lactose intolerant like me you can eat these they're the ultimate chip or you can crumble those in salad for that price scoop away so i'd say those three items in the uh snack food aisle are the most bobby approved and the sale right now for those two run fours run you guys the all the fine section is loaded with stuff here i cannot believe it and one of the items here is for breakfast and you guys always need breakfast information and new ideas this is organic multigrain hot cereal 299 for a one pound package what is this it's organic oats fortified with complex carbs like barley quinoa and rye flakes and this is the multi-grain one fortified with buckwheat flax barley rye and flax hello omega-3 fatty acids oh my gosh this is really nice because it's like oatmeal but then it has all these like super food and complex carbohydrates in there too so if you eat grains this is the kind of stuff you want to eat and it's super important it's organic because non-organic oats can score high in glyphosate the active ingredient in roundup and at 299 wow throw some like oat milk in there some grass-fed milk make an amazing porridge bowl that has complex carbs that is super cool let's go on the other side of this pole here hopefully no wall dozer over here i think we found the mother lode here in this little section here are a bunch of really interesting items uh this is one of my favorite things at aldi it's the 92nd packets they have barley and lentils they have faro and they have my favorite that i just loaded up on the quinoa and brown rice these are limited though but what's so cool about these is that they're organic when you have grains like barley and lentils you really want that but look at what the oil they cook this in extra virgin olive oil and that's it organic green lentils very important because of the glyphosate i love these because they help make really quick and easy dinners because they're pre-cooked faro is great but we don't really do any gluten at home barley has gluten farro has gluten which is why this one is my favorite this is quinoa and brown rice look at the ingredients here complex carbohydrates cooked in organic olive oil and it's the same price it's a buck 99 maybe a buck 89 over there i love these so much that in the new cookbook five ingredients semi homemade recipes i did a five ingredient chicken pesto and veggie plate and i used this as one of the ingredients and tossed it with pesto with chicken and tomatoes and broccoli it's fantastic the book is doing fantastic because of you if you want to get the book i put the link down below it's got 50 plus awesome homemade recipes using the best in class ingredients and products from the grocery store and this is one of them right next to that look at this this must be like a limited edition run on different flavors of crisps we talked about the other ones over on the uh snack aisle this is a peanut butter crisp the ingredients are very similar second ingredient is coconut our third ingredient is coconut syrup i believe that's coconut uh like nectar in the liquid form and then down there is coconut sugar it has the same amount of sugar per uh crisp as over there but this is more of a peanut flavor and the chocolate one is clean too so if you want to mix it up this all you find is a great price and then look at this they're getting into the coconut clusters game this is like their version i think of the coconut clusters at costco 5.99 let's see what's going on here we got coconut pumpkin seeds sunflower seeds organic cane sugar brown rice syrup and then chia seeds it's five grams of added sugar per ounce i can't really tell what an ounce is but do you guys see the similarity this is basically the same ingredients as eno foods coconut clusters at costco five grams of added sugar is not ideal but it's not a ton so while this is not bobby approved it's getting close and for a sweet treat that's not too indulgent i would get this one or the chocolate one it has the same amount of sugar that's super cool um this here even though don't be fooled even though this is in the propellant free non-chemical spray bottle and the price is right here look at the ingredients you have to see where they source the olive oil from and when you see it's from all of these countries like argentina greece morocco portugal tunisia turkey and then packed in mexico don't buy this in my opinion we have whole videos about fake olive oil when you source olives from that many different countries you're guaranteed to have mystery olives that are rancid spoiled and maybe cut with other oils too once they process it you want single origin olive oil i do love the fact that it's in the non-propellant chemical free bottle but i would not get that at all anything else here i saw this the other day when we were here scanning for the bobby approved app testing i've never seen this at any other grocery store butternut squash soup made with bone broth and everything is super clean but why are they adding sugar to butternut squash which is already sweet and it's not just a little bit of sugar it's five grams which is over a teaspoon per cup so if they got rid of that sugar both the butternut and the basil would be bobby approved and when it's fortified in the bone broth that has collagen and immune boosting properties it'd be perfect but that unfortunately is not good i don't want to come back to this oil here because brad just noticed something not only is it mystery olives like we talked about but uh they might have a typo here virgin so it's virgin olive oil that's mystery so another reason not to buy it but that's in all the uh all these special today my friends we're so in luck right now because one of the best aldi finds is out right now it's the family pack of the hundred percent grass-fed beef this is the one they normally have here and that's on sale too if you don't want to commit to the three pack but 4.99 for a one pound brick of a hundred percent grass-fed grass finish ground beef is unbelievable that price is the cheapest you're going to find anywhere for fresh organic grass-fed beef but if you want to get savings look at this this is the family pack and it comes down to 449 a pack why is this one of the best grass-fed deals on the market because if you compare this to regular ground beef this is factory-farmed gml ground beef the cows never ever eat grass and because of that the nutritional profile of this beef pales into comparison to this this is a hundred percent pasture-raised grass-fed beef they never eat grain because of that nutritionals are better for you better for the farmer better for the environment better for the cow this price is amazing get the family pack put it in your freezer oh my gosh you almost never see this hooray for that as much as i love this new aldi here in old town it is the coldest grocery store i've ever been in it's like 30 degrees outside and the ac is blowing everywhere but it's worth it it's so beautiful to be here um the dairy section has a couple really good items here at aldi specifically right here with milk if you're a milk drinker always go for the grass-fed milk oh do they not have it today well here's the the sign for it they must be out this simply nature organic grass-fed milk half a gallon for four dollars is a great price my only complaint is i wish it was whole milk because when you get dairy you want whole milk because that's where the omega-3s live but that price is great so let's say you're like me you come here they don't have it what's your next best option organic you really want to get organic milk because if you get conventional that's from cows that only eat gmo corn and soy this is organic corn and soy which is non-gmo remember i get whole milk so i'd probably go with this one even though it has the omega-3 it's a cruddy synthetic omega-3 that doesn't really matter i care more about organic and whole milk why do you want whole milk instead of fat free or reduced because what lives in the fat of dairy omega-3 fatty acids so when people get low-fat yogurt and milk and cheese you're stripping yourself of the omega-3s so ideally get grass-fed next best option would be whole organic dairy here and remember why is the grass-fed milk so important because they don't eat any grain it's 100 pasture-raised grass-fed meaning the nutritional profile and nutrients are higher than even organic grain fed or conventional grain fed so when you have the option always get grass-fed which segues over to the other side of the case here they have a great option here for irish butter so they used to have kerrygold but now they have their own private label and the rumor on the street is that actually kerrygold makes this for them and 299 is a great price because kerrygold now is 399 to 450 at some grocery stores this abides by irish dairy law meaning it's not a hundred percent grass-fed it's grass-fed 80 of the year just like kerrygold and the price is right this is actually the same price at costco per brick so this is the best butter here by far if you can't find that get the organic that means the cows don't eat any gmo grains butter here this is second best option this is first but wow between this and the milk down there you're made in the shade here at aldi aldi has a few breads that are actually really good and now it's an exciting time because there's an aldi fine somewhere here that is next level but when you're looking for bread look for whole grain bread if you eat grains whole complex carbohydrates are important but organic is even more important on top of that because here's a decent one here it's knock your sprouts off sprouted bread i'm going to say that at aldi in most grocery stores sprouted bread is where it's at but if it's not organic it's made with wheat that's conventional and always remember conventional wheat can score high in the active ingredient in roundup called glyphosate so even though that's sprouted and the price is low i would go one more layer up here and get this this is not just sprouted it's also organic ancient grain bread so this is pretty interesting because everything in here is organic and sprouted really clean you'll see cane sugar there but it's one teaspoon of cake i want a gram i'm sorry per slice and that's what you want most of these breads are going to have one gram added so add aldi this is probably the best you can do the reason why i'm keen on sprouted grains if you eat grains is because when you sprout a grain it unlocks more nutrition and more enzymes and it's easier on your tummy to digest so add aldi in my opinion this is the most nutrient dense healthy bread you can get but if you get your butt down to aldi right now they put it right behind the pole here i don't know why but this is an aldi find and it's so darn exciting check this out this is one of the best sprouted breads it's hidden behind the pole here at the old town aldi silver hill sprouted bread they have the big 16 and it looks like max flax bread this is even better because look at the ingredients here instead of just being a few organic sprouted grains you get all of these sprouted grains here and there's a huge nutritional profile here not just a few ingredients everything's organic everything's sprouted this one also has one gram of added sugar it's a little more expensive where's the price here hold on uh let's say the price i don't see the price but i'll look online real quick but this right now if you can run over to aldi is one of the best sprouted breads on the market along with ezekiel if you miss it and you want to get the other one get this one at aldi very very exciting time to buy bread at aldi you're going to need a cooking oil to cook all your goodies you're buying here at aldi so which one is the best well if you're going olive oil be careful because even though this is an organic extra virgin olive oil you gotta check the sources of where the olives come from and when you see this look at this it's from either italy greece spain portugal or tunisia it's a mystery olives i have a whole video about you're buying fake olive oil and stuff like this is a prime candidate for being fake or being cut with other oils or being expired you need traceability you want to get single origin olive oil so i would put that back but luckily right next to it is this 100 italian extra virgin olive oil it only comes from italy it's a little more expensive but this has traceability this is the kind of stuff you want to buy actually to cook with or you can make salad dressings out of it too i wouldn't recommend buying the avocado oil because even though i love avocado oil i have the same issue here with where the avocados are from it says product of mexico usa or spain if they're from mexico or usa that's great but spain is known for cheating in the oil industry and i can't get behind this one a chosen food primal kitchen or marianas at costco is better but i would get this the unrefined cold pressed coconut oil you can cook with this you can bake with this so this oil or that oil is the one i would get and even though this one says it's either from sri lanka india or vietnam or indonesia that's okay because you don't have those issues with fake and expired oil like you do with olive and avocado everyone needs a sweet treat in their life and aldi has two of the best ice creams on the market for unbeatable prices if you're keto this keto sundae shop ice cream is phenomenal it's comparable to any other keto ice cream on the market the cool thing is it's higher fat basically no carbs there look at that 17 minus three is 14 minus eight we're talking about a minus nine five net carbs here and the ingredients are just like any other keto ice cream on the market it does have natural flavors but in this case i'm okay with the natural flavors because there's no added sugar so this is super super cool five grams of net carbs and if you don't want the higher fat go to this this is their version of halo top it's low fat high protein ice cream so compared to the keto ice cream way lower fat more protein and once again clean ingredients do i wish the natural flavors weren't there yes do i wish the dairy was organic yes but none of the other ones in the market are halo top enlightened all the keto ice creams are all the same the only difference is these prices are cheaper and i love the fact there's no added sugar here so great for diabetics great for keto really really nice stuff boom boom two of the best ice creams on the market for unbeatable prices taking a trip down the middle aisle here we gotta stop at the pasta section because they have a couple really cool pastas right in this section here but no matter what grocery store you're at if you're trying to eat clean you still want to get some pasta in once in a while because you're human stay away from enriched wheat pasta or basic white pasta this has no nutrition it used to be a whole grain they strip all that away and all you have left is the simple carbohydrate that has no nutrition and spikes your blood sugars instead go to complex grain carbohydrate i like ones made from legumes but if you still want one from wheat you're going to want to go for organic whole wheat whole wheat versus this you can see the color still has the uh bran and the gr on the uh the fiber on there this is stripped of all that this has more complex carbohydrates and organic is a must but we don't eat any weed at home i think all wheat is inflammatory personally so i would live down here all pastas made from legumes like chickpeas and lentils are great ideally i'd rather have organic because non-organic legumes can score high in glyphosate but they don't have that here at aldi it's one ingredient red lentil flour because it's lentils fiber protein off the charts the same is true for the chickpea i tend to cook this a little bit longer than the box says so it gets a bit softer but this at that price is a great deal this is complex carbs that have nutrient dense properties stuff made from wheat like this that doesn't have the kind of nutrition you want to get this or at least if you want wheat you want to get the organic whole wheat there's a couple interesting items in the dairy section here and dairy just like we're talking about milk has to be organic or grass-fed so when it comes to cheese always look for the simply nature organic cheese this is really nice because it's sliced for sandwiches but right here is the most exciting thing this is excuse me this is actually keto we've talked about it before it's the folios cheese wraps i see these at costco but they have the parmesan ones they have the cheddar cheese ones here and they're on sale too these are great because they're aged cheddar there are no carbs and you can make wraps out of them or make them into crispy like taco shells this is a really cool all the fine that's always here and it's on sale now also so scoop that it's a bummer it's not organic but no folios are otherwise look for organic cheese like this colby jack right here all right fam that is it that is the clean eating guide to shopping at aldi 2021 big ups to brad for looking out for security wasn't nearly as bad as
