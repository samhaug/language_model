{"7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future make sure you follow me on snapchat and Instagram and everywhere else to see everything I'm doing I'm only supposed to on snapchat whatever new stuff I get first so especially if you live in PA and you want to see like what new fire stuff is around I'm on it like a [ __ ] so follow me on snapchat pipe underscore porn I'm at popcorn pretty much everywhere else things are about half the car that's impressive pitting about a hit that took I've been cheeping on this all day too I'm gonna be going up to Colorado next week so I'm gonna see how the lab present cartridges are out there pronounced you got a bunch of videos lined up around them out there let me know if there's anything you want to see probably me doing mostly vlogs so keep posting I can't do it I've never really been the big trick guy I'm gonna get to look cool to do babe tricks and I feel like I don't really look cool enough that just feel like a little nerd out there blowing little starfish or whatever they do thank you so much for watching click like if you enjoyed make sure you subscribe my name is Jeff peace [Music]", "q7dowCeZCa8": "to follow down like what's up guys simplistic here back with another video it is another cartridge video and it's a it's a friend that I've tried like two three years ago when I like started getting into cartridges it is the Blum brand you know saying all that good stuff but it is their life resin yeah so like I said I'm not the first person to do this I've seen some videos online but I am gonna do my own rendition of a video you know I'm saying but as you can see it says live resin hundred percent cannabis no additives all that good good stuff and as you can see it is galactic check and I like to mention that this is the first time me blazing today so it is technically going to be a wake and bake so you know saying let's just continue on so we got Delta 9 THC I believe it's running at 71 point seven four percent and I believe there's also some THC a I think 13 percent yeah 13 percent just in case you guys can't see we're going in for a little bit any guys good [ __ ] alright and also this was tested by canna safe by us thicker so how you tell that most of the time when you get something legit they're gonna have a sticker separate from the packaging like it's another sticker that they put on that's the the testing sticker that they put on but as you can see tested by canna safe I actually could not go on I didn't go on there being I couldn't find the test results but I heard canna safe is a really really legitimate company testing company so we're just gonna take their word for it big oil also does the stuff for I believe Bear labs so that's pretty interesting but it says contains no additives PG VG or vitamin e acetate I mean it has a CBD and CBN but minuscule minuscule so let's open this get my trusty lighter bro you guys don't know what the light of bro is I'm excited whoo my breast this is only $40 I have the receipt guys so I have them see here see out the door so is 29 but then you add the tax so about 40 dollars total I would say positive s but I bought it last minute all that good stuff the bloom break it's a very raw garden esque look very light fairly light in here sorry about that guys so push this yes definitely this is library I'd be a lot darker no blue thumbnail here this is a raw garden part basically this new [ __ ] laughing jack I get freaky by the way this is the death bait retro if you guys haven't seen that video already very very dope battery cheese boys let's turn that up a bit so they recommend 3.5 voltage so let's just try that but very similar to raw cardoon Wow it's cheaper to buy like five books it's a very lemony taste as you would assume from galactic Jack right but very very raw garden esque I would say very very good I like it like if I took this hit and I looked at the cartridge I would have thought its raw garden to be honest that's crazy cheers boys damn it the taste is there it's like I'm just looking sucked on a lemon ooh not gonna lie I'm very impressed you know for something to be of quality of raw garden five dollars cheaper you really can't go wrong with it it's a different brand you know so I had to try it bloom form the other strains that they had were also sativa so I'm probably just gonna assume that they tasted very similar to each other but as far as this brand goes or this live resin cartridge both very very good it's a lot lighter than your typical live resins very reminiscent of raw garden so I mean if you like rock garden you're gonna love this but like if you're looking for that dark type of [ __ ] this isn't like if it doesn't matter to you you know the color of the the live resin or whatever and this is good you know 40 I believe I paid 40 exactly for this so it's definitely not bad you know there's buddies that cost 42 there's select that costs 45 raw garden that costs 45 this $5 cheaper in and the same quality of raw garden I believe so uh yeah pretty a pretty high in THC 280 three point six three you take one more hit for you and I will probably get an end the video I'm probably gonna blow it out there to see just to show you how much smoke we actually get so cheers boys all right there you have it yourself get out of your head out of your mind going flying don't forget what I said keeping a lot of shits are so good out of your head adding a mind-blowing I don't forget what I said I found all of you still having doubts now like how it the distance is so wait yo and the drone waiting for some booze back by my time [Music]", "9Udxgbib4sQ": "what is going on guys today we're looking at a few different cartridges but we're mostly just talking about fake cartridges how to spot them how to avoid them how to tell the difference because the last the last year has been pretty horrible for pesticide ridden carts and just off-brand fake cartridges and when I say fake I mean companies that are real or do legitimately produce cartridges but are being replicated like if we start this Cali gold I don't know if either of these are real to be honest but if you look at these two like very clearly obvious like this one makes this one just look like [ __ ] hot dog water like I just smoked a whole [ __ ] card of it I don't know this one's more golden and I've also seen I've also seen Cali golds and like tubes like the you know like kind of like these almost but it's very important if you have a brand that you like it's very important to look specifically at them and look for tiny details so you when you when you go out to get them you know what you're looking for like these on the right here this is a fake TKO can tell yellow tip that's one of the more obvious ones and a lot of the times the fake cartridges will have white tips instead of this instead of these black tips and also it's just little things like like the lettering home you see I don't know how well it'll show up on camera you can kind of see on this this top one is a bit darker and sometimes the lettering is the spacing is weird it's just important to you don't know what you're looking for like research the brand that you like Rhys look at the cart look at the very specific details of it so you don't get ripped off because I mean my a lot of people may think it's just you know it's just one cart like it doesn't hurt me I don't feel hurt I still get high so it can't be faked but it's just a lot of health effects that leads from you know smoking pesticide smoking lead none of its good for you and you should be very aware of what you're putting into your body especially when it comes to vape and oils that's really it I would just I would just say do your research if something tastes off if it tastes funny if it tastes like chemicals stop smoking it throw it away get a new one you feel find a legitimate source that you trust and that they used their cartridges themselves you know what I'm saying even some people don't even care it's just important", "C9oz10WCTuo": "YouTube was going on we stopped with CY today and grabbed a kosher tangi cartridge make sure you hit that like button if you liked the video make sure you guys up

should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you and i'll catch you on the next video here on true buds tv yeah this is true buzz that mary j now we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session yeah true love for my true buzz light it up and i'm on it this vibe take me way back screaming i got five on it in the cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "_q2YChBKNZg": "so the video did get cut off like what I thought so I put my other car back on because I didn't want to hit this one yet so I'm gonna go ahead and pop it off and put on the TK old cart let's go oops and go I had to take off the little rubber piece I'm just gonna put it on my other cart just so it doesn't get like dirty and all that they're gonna I got that all put the new one on focus there we go it's not really focusing whatever I turned her off back then I'll turn back on there we go let's see first fat they're killing me I wasn't even sure if it was hitting it's hitting but it's hitting sitting very weird to be honest I don't know I don't know I don't know why to and wait though there's like zero smoke coming out of this I don't know if I got a busted cart what but this is not very good right now I mean some smokes coming out by there's nothing made this videos gonna be short because it's not I can't really hit this like I know the person like close that got me this I'm just gonna have him give me another one because I mean I don't know it's not really hitting that much and you said that like a couple of them weren't um working correctly so decided for one's busted just let him know and he'll give me um like another one so that's straight ahead that'll be in this picture right here nice boat on the TKO there we go that's a thumbnail picture right there so I mean I don't want to say we're done with this one this video I don't want to be finished with just that the form in the video 3-minute video I'm just gonna put on back on my cookies cart smooth that for a little bit just talk almost drop down so I'm just gonna put it back in the case now I know every box like it's like different there's so many different types of details um I guess I'll just depends I don't know so put the cookies cart back on and this oil on here is so I'm trying to get it's so thick because I've had this for like I don't know three weeks and I hit it every day and it does not die let so many people hit it like it's really super thick and lot of smoke comes out so it's pretty good I was pretty good most probably one of the best ghosts I've done to be honest freakin Lippert I like a little cutter something I'm newnode it from but I guess okay I don't even talk about nothing really yeah so uh let me know what you guys are smoking on let me know what type of battery guys use I always say it I just like to know because I'm more looking that cooler batteries come on that - beep um you keep I think that's the name here's the box I don't know what happened on my desk guys babe you keep pretty nice think two stories and then here's the back and then I have just well yeah it's a pretty nice battery small it's not like I've seen the key batteries I think double the size not the best that's mean in the video thing guys for watching subscribe leave a like comment do whatever if you guys haven't already I don't start giving some activity on this channel I've been gaining subs and I'm having fun so yeah and you guys watching she didn't sign me out peace", "ZCgLfXMXKk4": "hi there and welcome into another episode of how to from cure to you with me your host Noah today we're gonna tackle something that we've heard a lot in our dispensaries as of late you're going through and you're seeing the difference between two cartridges one says liquid live resin the other one says co2 and my word what is the difference before we delve into that there's one thing that we need to understand before we can talk about the different extractions to make those and that's the trichome of the plant the trichome is actually that white kind of bulbous part you see on the dry leaf itself and today I have a visual aid so as you can see these are the trichomes you can see the nice bulb on top and the reason that these are important is because those trichomes housed all of the THC CBD all of our turf beans all those can monoids are found in that little Bowl right on top and the reason that that's important is because to make our cartridges and our concentrates we are extracting that trichome off the planet so now that we understand what a trichome is let's talk about the differences that we see in our dispensaries of co2 versus liquid live resin so first off we're going to talk about liquid live resin and the main difference between this and the co2 extraction is at its harvest point when the dry leaf itself is ready to be harvested in a liquid live process they harvest it and then they flash freeze the bud once they flash freeze the bud it maintains its whole plant structure and then it's put through the extraction process using a butane hash oil wash where it pulls the trichomes off of that frozen plant and it maintains its chirping profile a little bit more so so you get a little bit more of a flavorful more tasteful medication when it comes to a liquid live extraction process but the main key is is that they are frozen at the point of harvest I have my co2 cartridge here now and the main difference between that we go back to the harvest point for the co2 extraction we harvest the buds and then we dry and cure them which is just a fancy Dancy way of saying we remove them of their water weight in some times during that process we can strip away some of the terpenes and so with co2 process we've put a we harvest our plants we dry and we cure them we put them in the extraction machine and instead of using that butane hash oil or BHO they use co2 to strip away those trichomes off of the plant to create a more extracted and concentrated form of cannabis and that's the basic difference between the co2 and liquid live resin is at the harvest point remember liquid live resin is flash frozen flowers where the co2 is going to be the buds are dried and then cured and then put through the extraction process but wait a minute there's a third one that we see in our dispensaries that's now becoming more popularized and it's called a distillate a distillate is used creating co2 extraction methods but once it's extracting out those trichomes they separate the terpenes and the cannabinoids the smell and the taste of the flower from the actual THC and CBD and then they distill it out and they purify it to remove any unwanted products like your chlorophyll and your plants or any residual byproducts of the extraction process once those things are distilled they're purified they're reintroduced with terpenes to create a more pure cannabis experience when it comes to your flower so basically at the end of this we have like we live with the flash frozen buds we have the co2 where our buds are dried and cured and then put through the extraction process and the number-three that you didn't even know we were going to talk about is the distillation process to create that purified distilled product that's able to be used in a cartridge now the main question that we also hear is what is the difference is there any medicinal difference between them and right now there isn't really any evidence that states one way or the other that's co2 or liqui live is more medicinal a beneficial than the other but if we use our logical sense here if we have a co2 extraction process and we lose some of our terpenes and we know terpenes work with THC whereas liquid live we maintain some of those terpenes a little bit more so one could venture a guess and say that liquid live might be a little bit more medicinally beneficial for you but that's just based upon you know a to B B to C then and that's just my opinion right now but hopefully is the future the more we learn about this the easier this process becomes and sometimes hopefully those questions will be answered but right now I'm here to give you my expertise in this field and that's it we went over three cartridges we went over what a trichome is and now you're a little bit more educated in this process so if you have any other questions comments concerns please do not hesitate to let us know we're here to help you you can get in touch with us on Facebook at Kyra Pennsylvania on Instagram and Twitter at your pen you can email us at info at Q pen comm we just want to hear from you because the more questions we hear from you the more answers we can provide and the easier this process becomes for everybody so from all of us here at cure to you at home you stay classy Pennsylvania", "EhsjT1EmdiA": "what's up gfm [ __ ] guys I was getting so [ __ ] annoyed because I couldn't find a good place to [ __ ] let's shoot this [ __ ] video cuz the Sun is out right now it's 8:50 in the morning and the Sun was shooting straight into the [ __ ] car so I was literally moving around everywhere and every single spot that I was that the Sun was beaming but right now I just move to the back of the [ __ ] gym so I was like [ __ ] it let's shoot this video real quick hmm so guys the long awaited sativa version of guess what [ __ ] brand Alpine guys live resin are gonna be bringing us cuz you guys know that well the per for the people that have been here for a long time he has no I never really [ __ ] the sativa sativa was never really my [ __ ] because the effects that I got from sativa for some reason we're just not good I didn't like the high I didn't like the way I felt you know [ __ ] like that but as of late I've been smoking a lot of sativa and I've been I've been liking it more than usual so yeah I've just been buying sativa pens buying some sativa but here and there but and foremost for the most part for most of the [ __ ] that I've gotten it's pretty [ __ ] good man and today we're gonna be [ __ ] trying tangi bro [ __ ] tangi the infamous tangent if you guys don't know tangi is a worldwide strain like it's been around for a while but a lot of people just crossbreed it and just call it some [ __ ] but yeah guys tangi right here you got the one full gram I've been smoking on this [ __ ] for a couple days I think about like Saturday or Sunday or Saturday or Friday so right here we got the THC I see that shift focuses him but never focuses in so we're going to tell you eight hundred and eighteen point 34 [ __ ] milligrams of THC and you got one point seventy seven milligrams of CBD total in this [ __ ] so now not bad the THC percentage is pretty high I mean when it comes to vape carts they're usually all around the same [ __ ] I'm percentage anyways and then like people keep telling me like oh try these it has it has a 100 percent THC 99% to you bro and honestly I'm gonna tell you the [ __ ] truth like these these have low THC like not low low but like 87 you 86 is in the highest range compared to whether these other cards have but the thing is I've tried these cards that have like like the dank vapes 97% THC and that she was [ __ ] garbage bro I didn't even get me faded so I don't really I don't really think any of that [ __ ] matters any of the THC percentage you know it and I don't think that she really matters at the end of the day like Bud 23% tc20 averages like low e-teens high 20s and that she gets you free to just [ __ ] like I I get super [ __ ] dummy figure out but so we're gonna get into the review with you guys this is what the oil looks like it looks pretty [ __ ] clear man I love it I love the oil you guys know I'm in love with Alpine so I've been smoking like I said since Saturday so where's that Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday today's Wednesday that's five days already I've been Lennie hella people will smoke the [ __ ] and look at still above the little cylinder right here usually when you hit this cylinder right here that's when you know you're running low and need to stock up again but it's above the cylinder stuff has I want to say maybe like point two point three left like on the top part and huh this is probably by far one of my favorite one of my most favorite sativa pens by like as like now because [ __ ] it this [ __ ] lighting and keeps changing because of the Sun so we're gonna take some [ __ ] hits I'm let you guys know I'm completely sober right now I didn't go to work today I [ __ ] killed it kicking it you guys already know the deal mmm so let's get [ __ ] baked on this on this [ __ ] Wednesday morning boys Cheers if you guys are a tune over you guys know the [ __ ] deal 18 over 21 and over whatever it is in your states don't be [ __ ] on that little kid [ __ ] man Cheers all types of [ __ ] people coming back here old ass people oh that's people becoming in the [ __ ] gym Early's [ __ ] yeah so right off the bat as a really citrusy undertone the librarian just hit your chest man and gets you instant coffee it's really nice though mmm by far one of the flate like I like I like the cartridges that have a little bit more citrusy in it like if you guys know what I'm talking about like when you take a hit and it has like a little zing like a little zing in the back of your throat that's what I like about these cartridges and today you guys forgot to [ __ ] mention it sorry about that using it on the good old heavy-duty Alpine battery used to be a little mountain on there you can still kind of see it they fade it off Alpine these batteries are [ __ ] like they last me so long dude it's incredible I haven't charged this [ __ ] in like a week already I just still giving me five hits so we're gonna take a couple hits and then finish off the review for you guys the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] doing this [ __ ] [ __ ] she literally moved her car from over there and all the way next to me she parked it over there like I like when I told you guys I was moving earlier like she parked and right next to me like I [ __ ] next to me it was weird and now she came on the other side of the [ __ ] on the other side of the [ __ ] parking lot and parked right next to me and it's [ __ ] awkward cuz I think she's just staring at me to give you guys a little hot box until she gets the [ __ ] out cuz it's kind of [ __ ] awkward and I've never actually like I think this is the part in my videos where I have to get over the awkward part guys like I'm sorry but you guys are you're just gonna have to get through this [ __ ] with me and [ __ ] she's just straight-up like me in my [ __ ] car while it's [ __ ] hot box but whatever yeah she's gone so cheers that's plus one for today guys right getting over some [ __ ] awkwardness don't you guys agree and take some [ __ ] fat riffs for that cheers boys [Music] those blinkers always [ __ ] gay whoo that was good though good [ __ ] hit right there that officially got me faded one thing tip I want to bring up for you guys dude I see people taking three-second hits for second hits and they take two to three hits why not just take one big fat ass blinker in there that's it you're [ __ ] faded like that first hit that I just took was [ __ ] unnecessaries [ __ ] I mean that blinker that I just took got me [ __ ] stoned like instantly so a quick tip for you guys don't [ __ ] hit don't be hitting a little 3 to 4 seconds just hit blinkers just hit one blinker and there you go you're good so yeah guys I love the flip flavor profile I miss citrusy has like I want to say I would compare it to like it tastes kind of like a little lemony lemony lemony scent to it so yeah that's the flavor profile the Terps on this are definitely they're not the most herpes cartridges I've ever tried but the chirps are definitely there I would give it it like on a scale from 1 to 10 I say the Terps right like maybe 7 it's almost an 8 but yeah the Turks are definitely there so if you're looking for something Turkey this one's for you the high I feel really not I'm not I'm not really mellow like the mellowness is there of the high whatever whatever smoke you like whatever you're smoking oh no indica hybrid wherever you're gonna get that mellow tone so that mellow tone is there I feel I feel still very aware of what I'm doing I'm not I don't feel really feel too slow about anything so - really good hi definitely feel the feel of sativa so I would definitely recommend this guy's overall [ __ ] I want to say I would give this out of 10 probably like a 9 out of 10 mmm Oishi I mean I want to give it a 10 out of 10 [ __ ] I want to give it a 10 I'm trying to figure out what I can find wrong with it but no I'm just gonna give a 10 out of 10 [ __ ] it there's nothing wrong with this [ __ ] definitely one of the best of TV pens I've ever tried go get this if you're looking for a really good sativa go get it right now and the flavor profile everything where we [ __ ] talked about this [ __ ] so let's just get on to [ __ ] chill talk and sit and smoke sesh guys so if you guys remember the hospital I [ __ ] told you guys if I hit 500 subs I'm gonna do the halftime challenge this that's so [ __ ] goin on so for all my new subscribers I have been getting go down comment share with your [ __ ] homies get me

to do that not a lot I feel like if I prepare myself for these upcoming them for the upcoming challenge man cuz I've already been taking dabs I've been taking like you know waxed cartridge hits

fact I'm gonna be [ __ ] completing the half gram babe challenge man so I'm gonna be going out and buying a half gram of some fire ass [ __ ] I'm not I was getting I was thinking about just going cheap mode and buying like like a [ __ ] cheap-ass cartridge and just doing it because I'm it's all gonna go to waste anyways you know but um I was gonna do that but I think since it is gonna be a kind of difficult challenge like half gram in one [ __ ] sitting I'm gonna [ __ ] eat something good something that's gonna be like I'll [ __ ] yeah like I don't really mind hating this so I'm probably gonna go buy an Alpine probably gonna go I'm gonna try to go get la Kush I don't know if le Kirsch has half gram disposables I might try to get one of those for the video so those three

"l7PHGUHdhNc": "story this evening an empire of illegal drugs that's the description of a massive THC vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "LIyzUVfJpN4": "you hid your vape underneath your pillows yeah and you would come and smoke how often oh I couldn't go longer than like 10 15 minutes without hitting it it was so addicting I brought it with me everywhere I went Seema Herman never expected that what she thought was a harmless habit vaping would end up nearly killing her I took two days for my lungs to fail and I almost died the 18 year old going viral with this photo from her hospital best a tube still pumping oxygen to her failing lungs in her hands a call-to-action asked for like a pen and paper because that was the only way I could communicate and I wrote I want to start a no vaping campaign that was the first thing I did when I opened my eyes Seema's story is just the latest in a landslide of incidents linked to vaping sparking what many officials are calling a national health crisis what we've seen in the course of the past let's say month is an increased number of people coming in with respiratory problems as a result of vaping so far the Centers for Disease Control report more than 450 possible cases in 33 states of lung illness associated with vaping and six deaths have been confirmed in California Illinois Indiana Minnesota Oregon and now Kansas last Friday the CDC issued a stark warning if you are vaping no matter how old you are you should consider stopping like I didn't think of myself as a smoker the vaping just makes it seem like it's nothing like you're doing nothing wrong Seema was in high school when she started vaping nicotine I was 16 the first time 15 and even the first time I bought it at the smoke shop I went in and I was like can I get a pack of jewel pods and they were like how old are you and I said 22 and they were just like okay it ended up becoming my oxygen I couldn't live without it I needed it all the time every day but because all of my friends were doing it all the time and no one else had symptoms that I had I couldn't like I wouldn't even have imagined that maybe this is killing me sima was an active healthy teen she'd been dancing for years even making dance team her freshman year of college but as her vaping habit increased adding in cannabis her ability to dance disappeared she was vaping a cartridge a day that's like smoking the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes in one day her parents had no idea their daughter had become hopelessly addicted this healthy dancer dancing 12 hours a week stopped dancing because of it stop living because of it stop going to school in college because of it Sima says she was feeling sick all the time over a year I lost like 50 pounds without trying 50 pounds yeah by this summer Seema had stopped going to her college classes she says her health issues were getting worse but no doctor could nail down what was wrong did you not tell the doctors that you've ached I actually did I made sure that every hospital every ER every doctor's office I went to I told them that I smoked but you never thought I can't breathe I feel like I'm gonna die maybe it's because I'm vaping every 10 to 15 minutes no doctor ever said like maybe you should stop vaping it all came to a head on August 15th when Seamas dad rushed her to the ER I said go fast don't let me close my eyes don't let me fall asleep or I won't wake up now why did you say that because I knew I was dying you felt death on you yeah it was terrifying the worst part was I couldn't I couldn't let it like my parents watch it happen to me but hospital staff couldn't figure out why Seema couldn't breathe two days later doctors had to put her on a ventilator I was begging them found her faster event her faster she's going to die it was terrifying it was in that agonizing moment that Seamas cousin revealed her secret addiction she said you know she smokes every day what what are you talking about you said she smokes every day she smokes that beep I said you tell the doctors right now you go tell the doctors right now and I ransacked her room and I found all the vapes it looked like gum wrappers they look like little candy wrappers they look like little cute a mascara wands this progression is so fast dr. Catherine Melamed is a pulmonologist at UCLA Medical Center she worked on Seema's case this was Seema's chest x-ray when she came into our Hospital these hazy white areas here at the base at the bottom of her lungs just show that she could have a pneumonia but what you can then see is if we choose an x-ray from just less than 48 hours later now her lungs all of this white haziness here is inflammation from just day 1 to day 3 is remarkable dr. melamed is on the front lines of what health officials fear is an emerging crisis the National Youth tobacco survey found a 78 percent jump in East cigarette usage among high school students alone but any research on the impacts of vaping lags far behind part of vaping is heating oil and then inhaling that oil and that's not something the lung is used to inhaling and so with that comes an inflammatory reaction that then produces phlegm and sputum and gives the lungs sort of that wet cough when property that sounds terrible and dangerous yes last month 17 year-old Tristan zou fell described how he spent 18 days in the hospital fighting for his life after vaping I woke up just throwing up everywhere how it was just pounding on my chest going 100 miles an hour Tristan lost 15 pounds and said he had to relearn to walk and just yesterday a Texas teen had to be rushed to the hospital after vaping at school passed out and you and I wake up like he was not waking up in Wisconsin today a man was arrested for making thousands of illegal THC vaping cartridges the state of New York is taking an aggressive approach in an attempt to find answers and crack down on black-market products you shouldn't be vaping products that clearly you don't know what you're you're smoking or vaping many vaping products are popular with young adults and teenagers but no company has taken more heat than Jul the industry leader the company says it's designed to get adult smokers off cigarettes but just this week the FDA sent a warning letter to Jewell accusing it of illegally marketing its nicotine bait products as safer than traditional cigarettes without proof Jewell responded we share these concerns about youth vaping it adds it shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts and recently began deploying new technology to verify IDs this yeah.but Seema's mom blames the whole industry for trying to hook kids early the fact that they market this crap to children and they turned into pink pretty purple packaging candy pisses me off there's a lot we don't know about the both short-term and long-term consequences of vaping and so I would just say don't and the week since Seema has worked to rehab her lungs she still feels that pull to pick up the vape now I don't necessarily crave the nicotine I don't necessarily crave the weed it's just craving like the act of smoking so that's been my hardest thing of like staying away from it but she hopes that going public with her story can keep her and countless others like her alive what would you tell somebody who's under 18 who's thinking about vaping and says I'm just gonna try it one time to see what it's like I would show them my pictures and say I tried it once too and then I tried it another time and then another time it's just remembering that you don't need it like it's gonna kill you for nightline I'm Adrienne banker in Los Angeles hi everyone George Stephanopoulos

all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give

this right here some moxie so I've been hearing a lot of good things about maxime and I heard this [ __ ] is like something fire I heard it's like some legit it's like the concentrate is a lot different than regular oil wax pens so let's see a little bit about this so I'm actually got this recommend until it's liquid moxie they said it's like live resin in a in a cartridge so I'm just like oh okay so that's kind of dope you know everything in the back oh by the way everybody this is Maui wowie I had again I had to get a crazy flavor I had to get a crazy player for you guys some guys somebody said to get these Moxie cartridges I I guess these are really good so we got a 5-10 thread bate cartridge okay that's usually the universal the regular you got the warning signs all that stuff could cause chemicals all that [ __ ] just so you guys know you guys gotta be careful man we got our smoky and these cartridges man you guys got to be careful alright so a little bit a little bit about it here this is some information about it it's a hybrid and all I know this should as far as 80% I'm not gonna lie when I cop this off the club I was just like okay this is kind of safe this looks already kind of cool so you can pop it off just like down boom you guys know me man I'm like trying all the cartridges and stuff like that so we have to do is you have to kind of hold it so we have to do is all right look at this just a little bit like this comes in a little container isn't that dope comes I got a little container so you just kind of pop it you push it that's kind of I guess to push it right there well well you have to kind of grab it push it just a little push right there you see that are you see that you gotta kind of have to push it you see that kind of push it by hand look at that that's sick huh oh that's sick but yeah this is no ordinary wax cartridge you guys this [ __ ] is gonna be some [ __ ] largest oh [ __ ] that would be actually really nice no no thumbnail look at that oh actually I got a good idea for the thumb no this is gonna be sick for the donor I'm gonna be like this I'm gonna be like that Moxie can you see it me up mark see just like that right there boom we got the thumb now you guys make sure you guys makes you guys drop a like makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe you guys you know this is a pocket we kick them back just talking about random stuff just really kicking back but today it's more of like a little review so let's pop this [ __ ] open you guys already know me we got a check we got a check you guys see that right there so by the looks of it it just looks like your ordinary wax cartridge look at that life gets better oh definitely does if you guys are right now man if you guys are feeling down anything like that just no nightmares do not last you wake up eventually I'm trying to find if there's like a little bit of information about it but I guess doesn't really tell me much but yeah it's definitely some white resin inside this wax cartridge it I mean it looks the same you know the color and all that stuff it looks the same but [ __ ] let's try it out you guys Maui wowie oh that straight-up tastes like a candy like let me see if there's a way if there's anything that I could like um anything that kind of tastes like this it tastes like a fruit loop kind of like fruit loops yeah it's like oh it tastes like a grape like if you're eating a fruit loop not approve of fruit rolls my fault a fruit roll is a candy I think I sort of toss fruit roll let me answer this call okay it tastes exactly like it smells it definitely has a little punch to it the taste is great like I feel like the taste is really good in this and like I'm telling us it tastes like a grape fruit roll-up like it has like a really distinct taste definitely definitely we're gonna have to get another flavor like it again there's no matter I'll be right there I guess this makes a lots of clouds and Moxie is I guess one of the most popular wax cartridges around I guess at that club but I mean I feel like so far rock garden rock garden and heavy hitters is kind of like the way to go I mean that's how I see you know the rock garden and the heavy hitters is so far but Moxie this is like the first time you know it's funny I just hurdled I literally just heard about mossy just this morning like I was just going through the dudes entirely because I wrote it thoroughly I go to thoroughly the club here in the Bay Area and we I usually just go on the internet I check out you know like the menus and stuff try to see if there's any deals any good stuff and I seen this I was like at oh by the way this is $25.00 half gram $25.00 so you cannot go wrong with this [ __ ] man the flavor is great I literally took took I took two hits and I already can't talked and technically I mean if you guys look at my face it's my eyes I'm looking a little bit late let's take another yeah there's some spire like this one it's good it's the Maui Wowi - there was only like four flavors that were at the club at that time but it definitely does have a great taste telling you tastes like like a fruit roll-up with a little bit of grape with a little bit of grape but that's just me though I got some sometimes I'll be having some like weird as like taste bud you know sometimes I'll taste [ __ ] I'm back I'll smoke something and I'll be like you know what probably this tastes a little like weird like it tastes like for example I'll be like dude this tastes like a burger this tastes like spaghetti like my mind is so weird it's sometimes like the taste buds I'll smoke something I think a bloody stump I'll take a hit Oh black little blind on she's like but why does this taste like candy why does this taste like this but it's like the trees like I know it's something on my brain but Moxie this past weekend I didn't really make a video but I went to Lake Tahoe so if you guys follow go

garden Robert and something it was a it was a wax cartridge boat but it was so clear and I kid you guys not man this you took one single rib and it made a produced a fatass cloud it was so crazy 1 2 3 it was crazy I was like dude why and one hate was just that probably like what $55 Graham again you guys I still got to make a video and talk about these wax cartridges cuz man I'm not I smoked the by one or two wax tortured baked cartridges when I don't even know and I found out to like kind of like you could say recently maybe like a month or two ago when I was like dude man there's a lot of fake cartridges going out there so it makes you guys get your stuff from the club dispensaries all that stuff and meets the same [ __ ] but still alright we up that a match and this is honest reviews these are honest reviews like I literally everything I cop is something that I'm gonna enjoy you know if I look at something I'm like I'm not gonna enjoy this I don't even cop it so I like to review stuff that it's just like I find appealing you know I looked at I'm like it looks kind of the same but at the same time I'm not like a crazy ass like fanatic though I can tell you know every what what it is by the look of it you know it's like there's so many concentrates out there you guys are so many [ __ ] out there that's why I feel like you guys gonna be like smoking on like stuff from like the club dispensary man because your local drug bluesman they got the plug I know they got the plug man you know they got the cheap [ __ ] all that I mean not cheap [ __ ] you know they got the they got the good stuff but it's cheap but sometimes man I feel like me like I mean I could trust them depending who they are but if it's just something like some random dude you know like just selling to like random people then I'm just like [ __ ] bro I don't know but let's see if we can make up that cloud Oh wasn't like the fattest but for me that was pretty big [ __ ] oh damn [ __ ] loaded I stay getting loaded in all the videos oh wow I just looked at the boxes at the bottom it says you guys want to go check them out information about them or anything like that it's mmm Moxie 7/10 calm oh [ __ ] 710 710 labs yo you know what I wonder who actually made these come on I really got to do that research I want to see exactly who made these Moxie cards at moxie we think of ourselves as something far more than simply that the leading producer superior quality extracts what we do is a service of a much larger and critical mission driving the research and education critical to ensuring that the valley cannabis is in society is respected and the rights of those who need us we need as most aren't protected and all that stuff I want to see what's like inside this stuff man I want to know what's in this um like I want to know exactly because they're telling me it's like rosin or light resin or some [ __ ] there's different oh I got the Maui Wowi Strawberry Fields liquid moxie we got Mel Mellon rec liquid moxie oh wow these those ones about better ratings the Strawberry Fields actually got a four point nine the melon drank liquid moxie cartridge got a four point five and then the malware we got a three point five so out of all of them oh and then we got Black Diamond og Oh so let's see what they say about this this card should let's see what the online world has to say now I was a classic sativa whose tropical flavors and stress relieving qualities will float you straight to the shores of Hawaii where the string was originally born and raised you know yeah hell yeah that's how I'm feelin I'm [ __ ] chillin bro I'm on a boat I'm just chillin I'm just I feel like I'm floating like like I'm awake you know like I'm looking down like - I got two monitors are hearing I'm just looking at us I'm looking both the stuff you know makes you guys go subscribe to him cut you one down the description that's my logging channel I'm looking at this pronto I'm just like I'm [ __ ] late and I'm super relaxed like I'm not mad I'm not stressed no nothing let's look at the reviews bro I purchase from Mission PA for $40 they got different $40 you know what I don't know if it's I don't know if this is a I don't know if they got a full grammar I love this train back in the 90s nice fruity flavor it tastes tropic yeah that's what it is it has like a tropical taste very uplifting I recommend in early morning we can bake with this do not to try this for the we can make oh somebody left the two stars this did not taste like cannabis to me effects are very nice though so don't write it off I baked it always expecting something that I tasted like great cannabis I try to find out what exactly Dan what the [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] like I got a chill my guess is that my Wow there my farm ghost in puberty my guess is that the product is built from THC natural okay to me it tasted like almond D slightly floral handsome huh the one thing you get in the gas station restroom oh [ __ ] I nobody's talking about I should say that [ __ ] smells great what I don't know what he's talking about that gas station soap is fired I mean yeah the gas station soap it's not that bad it's like the pink one you know that what smells break that [ __ ] smells good alright one two three all right let's get to the highest sensitivity everybody again this is some Maui I hope you guys enjoy these podcasts you know they're just little reviews honestly they're just kind of my review you know my honest opinion of this again everybody I usually have good of good good reviews and and all that stuff for almost all the products that I have here on this channel but it's just because I'm not again I'm not gonna buy a product I'm not gonna enjoy you know I'm gonna look it I'm gonna I'm gonna read about it you know I'm gonna look at it you know I'm gonna read it I'm gonna see if it's like a sativa hybrid indica I'm gonna see if it's like some fire you know maybe it's a wax cartridge I really get wax cartridges the ones that you guys you know [ __ ] offer me if you guys notice it's only been like heavy-hitters [ __ ] king pen and rock art and this like and probably like what like the newest one that we tried or maybe we tried different ones I'm not sure but it's we tried like known cartridges so copies obviously they're gonna be good you know because I try to go for like good flavors so cheers you guys damn I took like a little hit and I made a [ __ ] pretty nice cloud wow it's nice verdict because I think that's what you said or in conclusion in conclusion you guys the way the way you guys open this it's pretty shitty Megan I like you guys could see that right there right I was like little like a little pattern in the back yeah this goes in here this is pretty sick but I'm not gonna lie this definitely will make your cartridge now break or anything like that and it's not gonna get dirty or anything like that it's just perfect I think that this thing it just looks sick you know looks cool like oh I got a wax cartridge looked at on my huh very interesting but down for $25 half gram I give it a thumbs up man and I got anyway I mean I had to take by like a couple heads six seven heads but if it's like you know it's if it's if you guys are 18 or 21 and over and if it's legal you're safe to smoke these wax cartridges these ones 25 dollars you cannot go wrong you know what that was nice little hit gas station soap nap that's all in his head that [ __ ] i get i get a tropical taste like it's if i if i would have oh if it was a drop okay the tropical fruit loops the tropical the the tropical fruit roll-ups that is exactly what it tastes like a tropical fruit roll-up I don't even know if that exists but I can already just like taste it you know cuz I got you know I got some fruit roll-ups in the kitchen you know and I've been eating those I've been grabbing on those for like the past like I the past two days I grew up like a total of like three and I'm just like dandies are good at somehow smoking this [ __ ] I'm just like probably this kind of tastes like thank candy I'll leave you know and like let's take one last shirt make sure you guys

wanna see like you guys want to see a certain cartridge a certain strain anything like that drop it in the comments down below again this is an 18 and up [ __ ] late [ __ ] it wall more y'all that's like what like the 20th rift that I take and I took I'm dead Moxie you guys if you guys want a cop fire", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and know what i'm doing you know know when i'm going to make a video knowing i'm going live you know i always want feedback as well you know i want to talk to you guys too that's always awesome so much love you guys let me know what you guys thought about the video i will see you in the next video be safe peace out [Music] you", "ZQImEJ1zG9w": "[Music] yo yo what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of

guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "vfbEQNSMFXo": "[Music] so these forms of extraction kind of started like beautiful accidents like a lot of things in this industry being the first processors in the state of organ we dealt with a lot of new products and consistencies that have come about along the way liquid live resin is essentially our iteration of oil that can go into a cartridge we just take fresh frozen cannabis flower extract that here it get it clean and then fill cartridges with it so people are learning about distillate and about fake terpenes are liquid live resin is literally just libraries and it append there's no cutting agents there's it's not like a formulation it's not like I'm a chef and they're adding a bunch of stuff to a pot mixing it together and then putting it in a pen it's literally just live resin in a liquid form so that it can run through a cartridge from there we have innovated ways to then include liquid cured resin and those two products have a serious stronghold now with the demand for quality on the organ market so the difference between liquid cured and liquid live resin is the beginning product that we put inside so liquid cured resin is a cured either trim or node that would normally be made into a shatter and then the liquid live resin is fresh frozen that the cannabis companies will cut down fresh freeze it as quick as possible which gives you the highest terpene rich cannabis that you can have so that's just a differences the starting material as far as effects they aren't drastically different unless you're really looking for that 5% 10% more terpene variation which is liquid live rest when you pull this vape in out of your pocket and you have a drill on it you're gonna have that fresh plant experience just like you're at a farm walking the rows [Music] you", "aEwifGkXtUs": "[Music] young world what's the deal with support original beyond and today on my youtube channel we

that's gonna be yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the video you did leave a like I'm out these guys", "HZ4aCvghcLs": "what's going on youtube fam it's looney coming at you with another video as you guys can see this is the mask i was talking about that field gave me when i purchased a cartridge shout out to field dope mask appreciate it really nice so this is what i reviewed last video if you guys weren't aware definitely enjoying the product not talking about that one we're going to go ahead and be visiting a brand that we have uh already came across on this channel which is friendly [ __ ] farms excuse my language but we last time we uh had a little rodeo with their cured resin absolutely hated it and now we're going gonna go ahead and give them the benefit of the doubt and go ahead and try their live resin their actual live resin this is going to be the smoothie with a z total thc is coming in at 76.49 total cannabinoids at 79.86 so it's not that much uh not that much of a difference between the cannabinoids and the thc only three percent difference uh less than two percent in cbd packaged on 8 24 expires on 8 21 2022 so this is a it was a package relatively recent i already cut the box open just so i wouldn't have you know struggle with that on camera but obviously i haven't looked at the product yet they're a little saying you use it you know you deserve this i hope i do i didn't deserve the last one definitely didn't deserve the last one uh anyone that's not aware with friend uh about you know of anyone that's not aware of or know of friendly farms they're all true spectrum the whole live resin the whole real deal that's what they claim to be i'm gonna go ahead and see what their cartridge is looking like i've never had their live resin cartridges my first time so i've never had the strange smoothie and oh that is beautiful that looks nice look at this guys look at this beautiful live resin oil really nice they did a really good job so all right off the bat it's looking a lot better than the cured resin uh was looking smells really good like it smells smells very like uh very cannabis-y which it should you know it should smell like the smells smells real dab dab like it smells like real resin like real like resin is what i'm trying to say though obviously it's real resin but it smells like real like real resiny wow let's go ahead and take this garlic cookies off and attach the new and new one since i took this uh where was that little rubber piece damn so let's go throw it away idiot so i wanted to put this rubber piece on this cartridge right here on the bottom since i'm not using a cartridge no more that way to put it away keep it protected i highly recommend you guys to do that save those rubber pieces and use them all right screw it on this is the smoothie i have no idea what the crosses are what makes smoothie if you guys know go ahead and comment and let me know below i'm gonna go ahead and take this down to 2.8 because right now that's red is 3.7 blue was 3.3 plug oh no i don't want to preheat it one two three as green as 2.8 and they recommend you hitting you smoking vaping their product at anywhere between two volts and three volts so don't go above three don't go below two is what they're saying pretty much oh i'm so excited guys friendly farms i love their packaging black and yellow beautiful box packages is always nice they always have a they give you a little pamphlet with a bunch of random information on there if uh you guys can check out the other video on the gmo you know i'll show the pamphlet off doesn't really tell you much it's just pretty much re regurgitating what it tells you on the box that's pretty much what it is i'm going to try to get an aroma from this you guys already know the deal try to get aroma try to get a see if i can smell anything and taste anything before i vape the product let's take this off to do that i'll be honest so right i'm already having high hopes for this live resin cartridge and the reason being look at the headspace their headspace reminds me of ursus ursa has a lot of headspace just like theirs not a big deal but pretty much what i was saying is uh before i interrupted myself is most live resin cartridges most cartridges in general i don't get a very strong scent or aroma from the from doing this from the tip before vaping it this one excuse me this one has a very strong scent like i can smell it it smells like it smells like purple it smells purplish like it has given out that purple scent like so like a purple punch kind of scent wow all right that smells really good i'm actually wow this smells really good it has me kind of like wondering how it's going to taste you know cleanse my palate let's go in for it it's going for a pool cheers guys you guys got a friendly farms with you or any other cartridge you're smoking with you comment below let me know what you're smoking on take a hit with me and let's let's go ahead let's go in for this ride guys wow really good wow forgot to mention it's a hybrid really tasty wow tastes straight like a dab it tastes like it tastes like a purple smoothie like a weed purple smoothie that's oh lung expansion is there very intense uh cerebrally and um the relaxation the mellowness on the body is kicking in wow yo this this shit's uh this is uh some good ass [ __ ] this is some good ass [ __ ] oh my god that wow this isn't even my first smoke of the day either guys it's like it's in the afternoon for me right now probably 4 or 5 p.m right now and i've been smoking this garlic cookies uh you know i was i hit i hate it probably like three times today you know twice in the morning and then once in afternoon and so it's not my fruit this isn't my first smoke of the day not my first high of the day but it hit me as if it was like this smoothie live resin cartridge from friendly farms already from that initial pool from that initial hit already is better than his garlic cookies and garlic cookies is my favorite strain but i would rather pick up this this is more potent than this this is 82 percent this is 79 no this is 79 cannabinoids this friendly farms 76 thc 82 thc but this smacked me more than this did so whatever that means i don't know it might be just how potent the strain is but wow that was uh that was a very amazing surprising good hit excuse me all right let's go ahead and uh go for another one let's see if i get the same thing oh excuse me guys wow this thing actually uh it hit my throat uh my throat so you got me lit already hit my chest harder than usual usually um i can take these like nothing all right let's go go for another one that hit i said it's a hybrid it's an indica this is an indica but it hit me so hard in the head that i thought it was a hybrid wow so let me try to explain this to you guys the taste it tastes like something purple it has that very strong purple taste to it has a very strong live resin tone to it at the end upon exhale after you're finished hitting it you get that dab like that resin like a sensation like you taste it and then it's super smooth but on the exhale or rather on the inhale it hits you it's like a meal kicking you in the chest out of nowhere wow because it's smooth going down and then when you go it's like whoa you know it's like oh i don't know where it just hits you as you guys can see there's no bubbles it hasn't really gone down and uh and uh hasn't really gone down and uh the oil hasn't really uh decreased this has me faded guys you guys need to pick up this smoothie this smoothie um live resin from friendly farms you guys need to pick this up you guys need to pick up a friendly farm live resin in general this um ran me uh 60 bucks but and then with taxes it takes it up to 73 which kind that's like so much but honestly i see why the product is so expensive just because the quality is really there like it's this is some [ __ ] that i can literally hit one time put it put it down and i'm good i'm good to go just one hit is enough and you guys see i got the smoothie right i'd even mention but i'm about to i got another one coming for you guys hey this isn't uh sunset uh sherbert sunset sherbert i seen uh so this is smoothie which is a one i've never tried but sunset sherbert in a live resin cartridge four gram i can't wait to try that for you guys that one is uh coming in at 82.45 thc and 88 total cannabinoids so i'm gonna review that one for you guys uh probably after the ursa one after the after i review the ursa one but that's coming up so um in terms of what i uh expected from life from the friendly farms i'm not gonna lie i thought i had i didn't have high hopes for their live resin because i for some reason after trying the cured resin i just figured that the cured resin was gonna be similar the cured resin was super dark it tasted like straight soil like straight plants and oregano like like it even it almost it faintly tasted like weed but it tasted more like the soil that the wheat is planted and it was crazy i've never had any flavor like that in my life that's probably why i dislike this so much excuse me but this on the other hand this is like this rivals nug this beats field this kicks field right in its ass this is up there with ursa this is high quality good cannabis that you should be uh definitely consuming if you're somebody that that's looking for you know the top-notch [ __ ] the you know top-tier [ __ ] wow this um they had strawberry banana i almost got that one but the only reason why i didn't is because they had two different strawberry bananas one was a collab version which was friendly farms collabed with humboldt's finest and that that strawberry like a banana live resin cartridge full gram cartridge was at coming in at 90 thc 96 total cannabinoids and for some reason they have another strawberry banana but it's straight up just friendly farms and like like just like these just strawberry banana friendly farms and for some reason that live resin was at like 80 thc and 88 cannabinoids so so since it didn't have the most potent one i didn't grab it but i picked up this one instead and let me tell you i'm not disappointed whatsoever this [ __ ] exceeded my expectations and i'm looking forward to definitely trying the next one but let's go ahead for another hit and so i could uh describe it a little more for you guys because it does i see why it gets the name smoo smoothie because it's definitely smooth like it's smooth but then again i'm taking some fat ribs guys so that's probably why it's hitting me so hard and why it's uh hitting my chest so hard but let me take a normal hit and see how that goes wow so a normal hit like that you won't even feel it like it's so smooth like nothing absolutely nothing the taste it's hard to tell on the taste because those two fat ribs kind of have my mouth all like like not it doesn't feel like resiny but it's definitely like like i can like it's just smoke like you know you guys you guys know what i'm talking about after taking a hit that's what the water's for all right so i didn't get much flavor from that hip it was a small hit so let's take a big hit uh [Laughter] oh [Music] sorry guys sorry for any headphone users that crank up the volume wow that brought me to tears okay guys that uh what i just did there how i took three fat ribs i clicked the button three times i'd never do a blinker i like to do bigger hits than one blinker wow i also believe blinkers will eventually deteriorate your battery but that's besides the point anyways they got the cartridge uh kind of all warm and [ __ ] which i would expect but wow wow so normally i'm able to take three hits like that normally three hits like that and and blow out the smoke and i have a problem this had me choking as if i took a dab off of a rig that was insane i've never coughed like that off of a cartridge a cartridge what and it's not my first smoke of the day guys this is crazy i like i'm not ever reviewing another cartridge unless it's my first smoke of the day but i didn't want to hold i didn't want to put this video i didn't want to wait you know to review the product i was so excited to review it so i just got got to it but wow this [ __ ] is uh not only is it potent it's smooth it's tasty it hits the lungs at the same time of being smooth you can choose if you want a hit that's going to kill you or you can choose if you want to hit that's going to be smooth and you can go on about your day no problem all you got is just all depends on you taking a big hit or taking a small hit i'm hitting this at 2.8 volts any lower would be so much tastier i could only imagine and yeah you guys will probably could could uh so some of you guys have seen my other videos could say yeah why didn't you bring out the ursa uh ursa battery for this uh cartridge the reason being because i want to review that ursa battery using the ursus cartridge how it's supposed to not only that but they do say on friendly farms doesn't say on the box that you can use any voltage between two to three three is the max so 2.8 should be like if not perfect like you know if i would assume to 2.5 would be perfect but 2.8 is like you know two two below zero point two below the voltage uh limit so i think that's right around where you would want to be if not a little lower but i definitely would want to try this on a lower setting i probably will when i'm reviewing the ursa cartridge after i'm done talking about it reviewing it and doing my full review about the ursa i'll probably take a hit of one of these uh friendly farm cartridges uh probably most likely this one because i might have this one uh available to hit so i'm probably gonna try this one on the 1.9 volts and see how it is but so then this 2.8 perfect perfect hits perfect vapor production clouds i'm medicated as hell but i'm able to speak this is weird this is an indica for some reason i'm so faded in the head that i thought it was a hybrid so that's my that's another thing to say where in one of my other videos i mentioned how indicas and certain indica certain sativa certain hybrids certain strains affect everyone differently so even though this is labeled as an indica it's affecting me like a hybrid because i definitely feel relaxed i definitely feel the body sedated i feel my legs almost numb like it's amazing but i also feel extremely faded in the head and behind my eyes and right here in my temple area so it's very cerebral but in this very uh body height too it's very couch locked like they would say you know that's very it's definitely a couch lock i took three big hits so uh that's probably not going to be the normal dosage that you know you guys are probably going to be doing but if you guys want to experience what i'm experiencing then i would recommend to do the same thing take three big hits but i want to know comment below what you guys think about how my hits are because my friend uh my partner he always looks at me he'd be like damn do you take some big ads no wonder you run through your cards i don't feel like i run through my cards but let me know what you guys think about my hits are my hits normally or my head small do you guys take bigger hits do you guys take smaller hits like let me know what you guys i'm just curious is something that you know a little high thought but in terms of this cartridge man there's no complaints nothing i can say they can do better and i love the the tip the this tip is way better than this plastic tip that uh field has the this tip is perfect like you get like it just feels everything about it looks better feels better and it's just better quality the oil viscosity is perfect like it moves slowly very slowly like barely like exactly how like live resin would move is like it can uh hit it's crazy because it's like you can't watch it move up but as like i'll look away and then i'll look a look back a couple seconds later and then you'll see it uh at a different spot excuse me let's go i'm going to take another final hit for you guys wow i'm really enjoying this this is a big thumbs up i i i wish they had you guys going to hate me i wish they had this cartridge as a gmo and live resin instead of cured resin all right let's go for this final hit hope you guys enjoy your day like comment subscribe and pray for your boy wow this is the smoothie friendly farms you guys need to pick this one up let me know what you guys think i love it i think it's a

stoned out of your mind like a rot away like that and then so we're gonna get into this review guys and then we're gonna hop into a quick hotbox this is just a short video guys nothing too long so um you got the Alpine right here alpine battery you already know and then so I'm gonna read you guys some [ __ ] right here 700 45.02 milligrams of THC and 24.4 milligrams of CBD and this was tested by CW analytical safety quality science so if you guys want to keep that right there oh gee cush and man uh actually I've actually never ever in my life like had OG Kush like over the original strain oh gee coach I don't think I've ever had that [ __ ] like I see how the people talkin about oh gee this OG that but like I know it all stems from one specific og strain it has like ancestry and all that [ __ ] [ __ ] but I don't know I've never smoked some some real OG [ __ ] to be honest the only oh geez that I've smoked papaya B bubba kush OG and then Trudy those are the two the two only oh geez I really know there are the only ones that I really [ __ ] with guys so let's get right into this review guys because I'm trying to hotbox his [ __ ] gets [ __ ] hot in here fia's live in Southern California he has no it's been the weather's lately been [ __ ] hot like it's been hot as [ __ ] like this whole this past weekend that just passed by I think it was like 100 and 506 the whole weekend so [ __ ] man this weather needs to dip out right now it's actually pretty breezy it's weird man this Cali weather is [ __ ] weird bro cuz I like like I said it was hot it's been hot the whole week like blazing how I'm talking about you go outside your didn't get [ __ ] burn so and then right now it's [ __ ] windiest [ __ ] and not the helicopter day and it's been hella like musty there's been hella [ __ ] like humid it's been humid it's been humid and it's useless it's been smelling like it's gonna rain but it hasn't rained at all so it's kind of weird but whatever so right here guys one gram oh gee Kush Alpine live resin right here let's let's test that [ __ ] out oh the wait don't forget guys if you guys are eating over 21 in some states make sure you're smoking along let me know what you guys are smoking on comment it down below and let's get faded together boys Cheers this one hit so right away man this one hits quick hits quick guys I don't know it might be that's that's why I feel like that's why they call geez oh geez not only cuz you're their originators when it came and comes to eat but I feel like cuz this [ __ ] [ __ ] you up this she gets you it she hits you right away man this [ __ ] doesn't play any games man it has like a really like like a lemony like a lemony taste to a like when you hit it you feel you feel the lung expansion you feel your lungs expanding inside of you you feel the heat being trapped inside of your chest man you I like I'm naming a lie couldn't even keep it keep it in there like that long but [ __ ] man like I'm already faded I haven't gotten faded since I want to say twelve o'clock it's already about to be eight o'clock so I've been sober for a cool eight hours man like like I said guys this Alpine is [ __ ] good so make sure you guys go cop when I like cop [ __ ] I write this [ __ ] tenant attend to be honest man like I'm not even gonna do [ __ ] around and just say like oh this shit's good this [ __ ] that but man this no one no one does it better than Alpine ever I have yet to come across someone who has done it better than Alpine and the only thing that sucks man you could get the syringes too but I don't really see the syringes lasting you that long cuz the syringes are mostly for dabbing and refilling and honestly guys I don't recommend refilling your your these cartridges right here after you run out of oil I don't recommend going and getting another syringe and injecting it because the the coils inside of these they're not meant to last over and over they're meant to last so after one or two uses maybe but from my experience every single cartridge that I've tried refilling they all burn out after a couple hits after a while it doesn't taste as good as it should so in my opinion is just better to go with the brand new cartridge with the brand new flavor you know whatever the deal is I don't recommend getting a syringe because you do not get your money's worth it's the same amount as a brand new full gram so might as well just get the full gram and it's all about saving you know why waste why waste the same amount that you would that you would on a cartridge with with a syringe like it makes no sense so well that's another topic one quick topic I want to chop on today guys cartridges I've seen a lot of people commenting saying they have leakage issues saying they have this aim to have that and I want to make this video to basically like give you some tips on how to save and the wax from these like as much as long as possible so let's go let's get right into it number one would be try not to try not to let it go outside down try not to let the wax touch you this very top part because some wax I don't know if you guys see right here but so Mike's get stuck on top of that and it's it's [ __ ] hard to get it down like even if you try using a lighter it gets stuck up there I'm not sure exactly why but yeah that wastes like either your waste like point 1/2 of a point like you know [ __ ] like that but it's not too much but you definitely don't want to be losing any of this wax cuz it is expensive my bad guys it is expensive so and we don't want to waste any of that my second tip would be the most obvious tip that anybody should know anybody should know that B should be vaping this they should know not to leave it in the heat do not leave it in the heat I'm talking about like if you go to work and you take these with you and your skin you don't keep them in your pocket while you work or if you're at school you keep them in your car don't keep them in your car man don't keep them in your car cuz he shits will leak guys like they've leaked so many times on me I like I've wasted so much wax but yeah they leak from right here on the bottom and when especially when they're extremely high temperatures like they'll like that guys so definitely don't be leaving it in hot places don't really mean in your car don't be leaving it in your room if it's ha anywhere that could be like that can cause damage this don't leave it in there and then also don't don't leave them on the batteries or whatever battery you guys use whether it's like one of these or whether it's a [ __ ] Ave battery I don't recommend leaving it on there for too long because it does spill even though even though like it even if it's not in the heat it does spill sometimes so I don't recommend doing that the third tip I would have for you guys honesty the final tip would probably be moderation man moderation is a big key when it comes to these when it comes to these [ __ ] pens because I feel like I know a lot of people that go out there and they go throughout their whole day just hitting it hit after hit after hit after hit even after they're high and I don't even know if they realized that they're hiring up but like that [ __ ] kills your wack so fast look at this I've had this one full gram for almost four days almost four [ __ ] days and I'm still I'm still above half a gram I'm still above half a gram I'm chilling you guys have to e like you have to make sure when you guys are using these don't be up here [ __ ] hitting it like over and over men just try to [ __ ] get like you're high to to ghost in hell and you're [ __ ] good to ghost in hello guys if you guys didn't know that's supposedly a lot of people say that that's the fastest way you can get faded would be to just double ghost in hell if you guys don't know what that is I'll show you guys right now just for the purpose of the video just for educational purposes [ __ ] it we're about to get faded so here we go guys to ghost inhales these are what these are try to hold them in as long as possible if you want to get the most out of your wax try to hold them in as long as possible I'll make sure to make another video on how to get the most out of your product out of whether it's bud whether it's waxed whether it's edibles I mean I don't really [ __ ] with edible so I mean mostly just bud and wax but I'm gonna show you I'm gonna make a video you soon on this [ __ ] so here this is what a ghost inhale these guys right in the chest as long as possible that she can see feel like that I don't care how much of a tolerant you have I don't care how [ __ ] bad-ass you think you're to go she nails especially with some [ __ ] lie resident [ __ ] you up I'm very faded as [ __ ] yes can't really see I job something but yeah guys man I'm [ __ ] stoned as [ __ ] I'm gonna go to the gym right now stoned just [ __ ] I mean I do it everyday but whatever so I guess we're coming to the end of the video guys we're not gonna do a ha bucks like I said earlier in the video we'll get to that another time maybe next week we'll do a vape / a vape and vape hotbox vape and vape so we'll probably do

out there episode 19 string reviews with your boy Tommy chokes and let's get right into it today we got that definitely 10 thumping in the background knew what we're coming artists some fire right here but anyway today's string we're gonna jump into some Jack Straw a nice pure earth cartridge so one thing I love about the kill period cartridges is that they're very clean no PG no peg no MC teens none of that garbage in here like I said in other podcasts ain't trying to get killed by no cartridge I can try to get taken up by the cartridge survived the Bronx for 25 years and you know I'm trying to be put in the coffin by this coffin but anyway comes in this nice coffin style package and once with these guys this little sticker here has a tendency I know when we hang them up on the shelves they kind of drop down a lot but anyway you see how it slides down there Jack Straw is the strain today now Jack Straw is Steve a dominant it's a touch of touch of gray with Jack the Ripper but one thing I noticed with this it's got a big old bubble there so I don't kind of like that I usually got two bubbles so it's got one on the bottom one up top there so I try to avoid anything with the big bubbles in it obviously I'd like my cartridge to last a little bit longer and that has a tendency is not allowing that to happen but anyway it's just jump into this cartridge to see what's going on got my Moxie battery here allegedly this is good for anxiety depression but everybody's cannabinoid system is different so you know that's a hard one pinpoint their everybody's different so like for instance sativas they say you know german poison is the expression of sativas they put me to sleep so we're all different but shots of vaping for providing a hack also WTF which is one of the newer brands out there in the extract world and it's world's THC Factory they're definitely jumping subnet products and you know do some reviews on there and definitely stay tuned there but let's make this for episode the rest of this for the rest of the smoke man but yeah we got this Jack Straw and it's gonna be a sativa dominant let's see 80% sativa 20% indica I like they provide that information right there and a cartridge for us but yeah let's jump into this okay definitely a very lemony Wow lemony very sweet also button tap that bubbles bothering me usually you know you don't see that appeareth cartridge but I'll have to learn to live with it be able to get one more year definitely very tasty got a really nice taste to it normally I would give it a two stalks up but because of that

functional to check it me stay stalling stay off I'm elevated stay motivated more content on the way please subscribe", "eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "aEaoDC2EwM0": "it what's up guys it's your boy master blinky back again with another video today what we're gonna be taking a look at is this live East Coast cartridge cart I haven't really seen these around before I recently got one and I've been really excited to try it for you guys it says that it has one point four percent CBD eighty-two percent THC and six percent Terps I like that it has the stats like that and they actually seem believable real cards shouldn't really test above 85 percent if they have Terps in them um and having some CBD in there is cool too apparently it's supposed to give you forea um and give you an energized mood and it's a sativa hybrid so yeah let's go ahead and get into this card so opening up the cart we pull it out and we see that it is AC cell atomizer with a white ring on the bottom a lot of people says that that means that it's a fake atomizer but I also want to think that maybe it's because live rebranded at C cell atomizer they also put their logo on top of the mouthpiece which actually looks pretty legit not gonna lie so I'm hoping this car actually hits pretty nicely and tastes good as you can see the bubble is actually pretty slow it doesn't move too fast at all so I'm definitely definitely having some high hopes for this cart so let's go ahead and get into my first puffs of it alright y'all so I'm gonna take my first puff off this live mimosa cart I'm using my C cell m3 battery because that's the pretty standard battery that most car companies will sell with cards so either way let's actually check this card out Cheers [Music] okay feels very smooth cheers again [Music] when it comes to the potency of this cart I am already feeling effects I'm already seeing the flash very weird it looks like a star in my vision taking that blinker straight looks a bit rough on my lungs Matt go lie well I'm sorry I feel very warm as well I think I'm gonna be a fan of these cards oh of course I can't give my full opinion yet I always want to wait at least a day to tell you guys if these carts are good but before I go for right now I'm going to be taking a hit out of the damn cap so Cheers [Music] but I tell you that this part feels a little different um it's slapping a bit more than I'm used to not gonna lie like I'm for sure gonna take a night to review these and then tomorrow I'll tell you guys that these are actually yes but as of right now I'm like a hugger home it is just [ __ ] awesome all right yeah I'll be back tomorrow B's all right hey guys again I forgot to record a hit from the CBD [ __ ] battery so I'm gonna do that real quick I already preheated all we got to do is hit it Cheers this card produces such thick smoke oh my god bro also what you hear in the background is me about to record another gaming video in case y'all are kid get hip to my gaming videos they're actually kind of funny like what the [ __ ] are you doing also subscribe to the channel if you're not subscribed and leave a like I'm really high right now I love this cookie I'll get back to y'all tomorrow see it alright hey what's up guys I'm back so I've been smoking on this car for two days now and I think I'm actually a fan of it so after two days I've only used around 1/4 of my cart which is really good on those TKO cards I two days I was around halfway done this I definitely still have a good amount of uses out of as far as the highs go I don't think I could honestly get over 10 hits of this thing without having like take a break for a bit because I was just too tired or too high when I say too tired I don't mean like this car put me to sleep or gave me a headache or anything like that it's just after 10 hits I was like way too far gone to even know how to like actually function it was pretty awesome not gonna lie another thing about this card it's starting to get a little cloudy which doesn't worry me a little bit but I tried to do some research on it and I've been seeing that some extractions or like some people who extract their own oils end up with levy oil - and I don't know if that's something to do with the plant that they start out with but it has something to do with the extraction process but either way I'm not tasting anything odd that the current hasn't become harsh and it hasn't become less potent that's something that I do notice with other card brands that I've tried at least like dab was TKO sometimes even dank vapes sometimes after you get around half to two-thirds of the cart done they start to hit a lot harsher and then they sometimes change color actually with that with the dr. zodiacs bait card I reviewed the bottom of the cart started to turn a little black from where the atomizer was so those are signs that I look forward to seat bag carts versus this one which actually does feel like a quality and good kart I massage with it a little bit just to see if like maybe the wax is getting a little cloudy because of it just sitting so maybe after heat it up a bit it'll be fine so I'm gonna take around three puffs on it and then I'll do a wrap-up Cheers [Music] [Music] just a little - coughs from that but very nice vapor and very good flavor on it I forget what I said it tasted like last time I'm gonna take another hit right now just to see you again but it definitely does still have a very consistent flavor cheers again [Music] I really can't get an actual like opinion on how this car tastes it's so odd because I really can't like pinpoint the exact flavors of this cart I know that it had a around 6% turps in it so that's probably why I'm not getting like super strong flavors versus like other cart brands where they actually use like flavoring or they use a lot of Terps and that's why they're very runny this car isn't runny at all it's actually very slow-moving and it feels like it is I really think that's why I'm not really getting super strong consistent or super strong indescribable flavor simply because distillate doesn't have flavor um I'm gonna go ahead and hit it out of a rig though and see if that helps Cheers [Music] [Music] all right so we got a good amount of calls from that hit but I'm not gonna lie I don't know if y'all have ever smelled play-doh like if you had a little cousin who like played with it around you or you have like siblings but this cart tastes house this cart tastes just like how play-doh smells um I don't know how y'all will take that I think it doesn't actually taste that bad I'm not gonna lie but I've also never eaten play-doh so if anyone in the comments has tried play-doh go and let me know if it tastes good either way if I had to give this Curtis or I would give it an easy eight out of ten the wax did end up getting less cloudy once they eat it up a bit so I think that that's not really a sign that I'm gonna be worried about if I should be let me know though but yeah this card gets an 8 out of 10 potency easily a 9 to attend this cart is amazing I don't need to hit it a lot to get high it lasts a while um and the wax feels quality when it comes to taste I'll give it a 7 to an 8 out of 10 because I cannot really exactly describe the way it tastes other than how play-dohs smells or however I described it in my first it's a bit the atomizer is a real C cell so it tastes good it hits hard and you get good hits out of it versus seven tens which I don't think hit as hard overall I have never heard of live East Coast cartridges before getting this one but after getting this one I would put these above tank vapes or even kingpins king pens in my opinion are a bit overrated this is what a cart should actually feel like if you're buying it especially off the black market this is amazing so yeah 9 out of 10 this cart is great it's consistent and I would definitely suggest it to y'all if you see them around you um good job live East Coast cartridges so I'm in the video with two blinkers from the CBD 5 battery if you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like and subscribe check all the links in the description if you like this battery which I would highly suggest as well check the affiliate link in the description below it helps out the channel I'll put either way I'm master bling see it's been a pleasure I hope that if you guys can see these hurts and you try them out you have good experiences with them let me know but uh either way Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "OHTBbns6PMQ": "so today we're going to be going over the og kush gram distance by kraft um you're going to see me mention later that it's like also branded oil as well but it's spike craft so let's get into it all right this is a full gram or a thousand milligram uh og kush cartridge this is by craft oil cartridge by craft um and i want to say i picked these up for about like 15 bucks or so and um i will say it didn't work initially on my yokan styx battery and then i tried it on a ooze battery uh and it didn't work so i had to resort to my magneto and it works on my magneto so i don't know the hardware is kind of weird for these i guess that's always been like an issue that i remember having with these because i've had some of these before in the past but other than that uh they're really good cartridges and they're really great they taste this one in particular doesn't really like have like a flavor it's not like a flavored cartridge per se this is like o.j kush you know more like a weed strain so it's got really no terpenes for like you know to taste any kind of way that you would think it would make it taste fruity or good but other than that these don't taste like terpene-wise like or without the terpenes i should say don't taste too bad so these are pretty fire all right so we were talking about the thousand milligram or gram craft oil cartridge i got this at the golden meds federal location and uh i want to say i paid if i didn't i already mentioned it like what uh 12 or like 15 bucks and at that location that's the location where i had the incident like i said where i bought the uh veritas or the veritas and it came empty that's also where i got the uh consumables the keef drinks and soda or whatever but they're going to come these cartridges when you open them like i said i'm going to insert a photo or picture of the containers and tubes what it looks like the packaging and they're going to come with these uh orange tips here and i like these because these are nice i'll keep these on there after i'm like using it still after i've already opened it because what it'll do is it'll help keep like lint and stuff out of the tip and whatnot you'll get some like gunk and [ __ ] in the tips and sometimes you hit them and then they're clogged or whatever you just get some crap in there and then it goes back down into your cartridge and it can kind of mess it up so you don't want to do that but other than that the taste on these like i said they're going to be very earthy they're going to have like a normal like not really any kind of terpene taste that like any terpenes added to it to make it taste like flavorful or like fruity or like any of those flavored ones because this one like i said is uh oji kush so very very good earthy taste i recommend like if you're out there in colorado at all ever anywhere in the dispensaries you can get a hold of the oil the craft cartridges go ahead and make sure you do really great good quality distillate but that's going to wrap it up it's going to be a short one and just a quick review of that cartridge i was only able to get one of them and uh yeah so like i said stay tuned for anything cannabis related or you know smoking related so peace the [ __ ] out like comment and subscribe", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "grbMuzo9DW4": "is going on guys it's your boy gurney thank you very much for tuning back into the channel and if you guys do not subscribe please do so now you'll then get notified of all the videos i'm dropping i got a big dispensary haul coming up i'm going to hit the dispensary tomorrow i got a pile of stuff ordered a mountain of stuff for edibles all sorts of stuff so anyways uh yeah please subscribe to the channel and today guys we are getting into agrikind you see i got my shirt on they sent me this shirt they were sending patient shirt shirts quite a while ago um and i was lucky enough to get one got some buttons some magnets and some little uh notepads from them as well but in today's video this is uh pretty cool here i'm a big cartridge fan and today we are getting into this first agricutting cartridge i've had and um it just says rainmaker vape cart there on the front but what you want to see here is right there this is a liquid sugar cartridge so i emailed agrikind messaged agrikind whatever you want to call it and uh ask them so what are these liquid sugar cartridges you know because there's a lot of controversy on the in the pa medical marijuana market as to like the way some companies label cartridges like or is it accurate the way they're labeling them you know some call things live resins that might not really be live resins you know so i was interested to hear what they'd say and ask them what different parts they make at agra kind and all and uh the answer that i got this liquid sugar cartridge so this is cool i was hoping this was the answer it's exactly what it sounds like it is so i'm going to open this up so you guys can see but um so it's called the liquid sugar cartridge so that's what it is now me i like to get into the geeky parts of it and know exactly what's going on and all and um so what this is what they do is now look they put that little hybrid sticker on it there if you guys can see and we'll take a look and see what type of cartridge it is but um so what was i saying so oh yeah the liquid sugar so it's just all that this is is decarb wax decarb sugar so decarb concentrate what decarb means is decarboxylate it and that means like when you heat up the uh the oil or the weed or whatever to a certain temperature for a certain amount of time and it turns the thc a molecules into thc molecules so thca is not like as available as thc is so um yeah they decarb it um because here i'll show you is what look here's an agrikind sugar right here i hope i'm not all over the place and i hope you guys are following um i gotta understand just because i am understanding this like i know you guys completely some people might not and i'm not explaining this perfectly by any means i am learning right along with you guys but i'm doing my best to you know just be uh honest and informative here and show you guys what you're actually getting so this here is agrikind kosher kush sugar i'm gonna do a review on this for you guys i got this with the liquid sugar cartridge but the reason that i'm showing you this here is because that's agriculture and sugar there and then here's agri-kind's liquid sugar cartridge so i'm going to take that little hybrid thing off of the cartridge here so that you guys can see how this is filled and all and then i'm going to throw it on the uh my uni and we're going to uh give it a try the strain so it is 74 thc and then eight and a half percent thc a there's a little bit of terpenes in it one point four percent limonene 1.3 mercene and one percent cario so it has three terpenes over one percent let me show it to you guys here so you get a proper look at it i hope you guys can see that so it is a really light colored oil okay like it almost looks like it's just distillate you know but they said that it's just decarb sugar so they took that sugar i showed you they heated it it uh it bubbles and all and then after a certain amount of time they're professionals they know what they're doing it becomes like a more viscous consistency and then you're able to i guess they were able to add it to cartridges i know when i just decarb sugar myself here at the house i can't just draw it up and put it right into a cartridge i have to add like terpenes to it you can purchase or wax liquidizer that you can buy they cut it with different things so i'm interested they're saying that it just decarb wax but i wonder how they were able to get it to stay this consistency to get it in the cartridge that stuff's very interesting to me but um you see how light this oil is here okay so i showed you how light colored that oil is you saw look at this concentrate from agra kind so that's a darker one okay it's like it's not super dark but you see so i i would think like um that if they decarb that that the oil would be darker from that one you just saw but then it made me think now look at if they're taking concentrates like this here this uh i don't know how well you can see that in it but this was really really white at one point um it kind of darkened up a little bit this is some pandora's box crumble from them and it was super white when i first got it so i'm thinking maybe they're taking like their concentrates that are like crc'd like the color remediation technology that they use um i'm wondering if they take those concentrates possibly and then cook them down like i said decarboxylate them and then make this oil but either way that's my silly science lesson for the day and i probably didn't do too good with it but i did my best you know if you guys did have any questions on decarboxylation or you know anything that i was just explaining you guys can leave it in the comments or follow me on instagram my dms are always open over there it is at pa underscore gurney and i will put a a graphic up for you guys and yeah it's gurney like the the stretcher thingy you know in the hospital gurney it's pretty easy but this is a uh jupiter c cell cartridge that's the the brand i don't know if you guys are going to be able to see that on the bottom there now to me a cartridge a cartridge aficionado i i like uh the jupiter c cells they just hit really good and um i know prime uses them but uh anyways we're going to i'm going to turn on my uni here and what i did is i screwed the bottom attachment from the uni on and then you just drop it in there like that and let's see cheers wow it hits like a mack truck like i'm telling you these jupiter c cell cartridges wow not much flavor at all i'm not gonna lie it is it's almost flavorless i'm shocked i'm shocked with this terpene percentage actually guys 1.4 limonene 1.2 mercedes 1.0 cario it's not crazy terpy like i have uh my here's some pharmaceutical rx cartridges right here truly funky has 6.7 terpenes in it and this chem four one two nine percent terpene so i mean there's probably only about four percent in this one i'd say it has a um a real clean flavor to it let me try it again i still the little one guys i honest to god i can barely even like tell you like what i'm tasting i don't know am i sick am i getting sick or something i don't know but i i'm not getting much flavor off of that guys it is um it hits you in the chest though like that good feeling it um it reminds me of a uh like pharmaceutical rx makes the delta nine cartridges and delta eight cartridges like i'm feeling the effects coming on down the effects are nice i'm feeling that for sure for sure because i only did one dab since i'm home from work tonight um right before this video some african tie but uh i can feel this chilling me out for sure so that's a positive but yeah in the flavor department guys it's somewhat lacking it really is and something that always interests me because you know the cartridges they they say that they wick like it could sit on the shelf and by the time you get it maybe three months later it might look a little less filled because some of the oil absorbs into the inner part of the cart you can't see it then but it looks under filled this one was like filled with a tippy tippy top but what i'm getting at is when you take a big hit then like little bubbles pop out of the uh the ports right here and that's like you could see how much oil you're using up based on like the little bubble that comes out you know i hope i'm making sense but uh one difference i do want to show you guys here this is this is an interesting difference i have a cresco live resin here okay and then i have uh the agrikind so i got both of these here now look at the mouthpieces hopefully you guys can see that but the agrikind one is really really narrow and small and the cresco one you see is a little wider so not a huge difference but something i thought i'd point out to you guys so i'm gonna wrap this video up here i guess guys because i mean there's really not much else to be said about it it's uh the effects seem solid flavor i mean honestly it reminds me of a a distillate cart um i paid how much did i pay for this was it it was 60 and i got a discount so 51 so i think for that price i think it is a little high priced it's kind of like uh reminds me of like um a distillate cartridge that's that's what it reminds me of and i mean that in like a good way you know distillate has its place absolutely i did expect a little more flavor from the cartridge um but maybe that's just this strain you know it could just be the rainmaker strain i'm not sure or maybe i'm getting sick i don't know people might tell me i'm crazy that cartridge tasted great i don't know but to me it doesn't taste all that great and i know for sure like this kosher kush sugar oh my god it tastes amazing and there's uh less terps in this than there is in this cart so it's odd it's odd to me oh there's a funk a funk going on with the rainmaker i'd say like um i don't know the lineage or any genetics in it or anything but um it's funny i pulled out that pandora's box over there and it um that pandora's box had a funk to it man but uh with this flavor-wise they'd say minor bits of funk with uh that distillatey like not i won't say uh is it like chemically i don't know maybe you could say that but um not in a bad way uh yeah if i was rating this on a one to ten scale just to put it real simple for you guys i'd give it a seven if that makes sense on a cartridge scale you know my favorite cartridge of all time being a 10 i'd put this just right about at a seven not horrendous not anything amazing would i buy it again i think i would um if i could get it for about 50 or lower i think 60 dollars too much i'd like to pay right around 40 bucks for this i think that'd be fair 40 bucks for this i think it'd be right on the money so thank you agrikind um for the meds it's always good um always solid people and thank you for getting back to me like that uh so that i can you know come on here and not sound like a lunatic giving crazy information to the patients so uh yeah solid cartridge guys i hope you are having a a good night all this election madness going on and uh oh if you need any uh dabbing supplies

guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "of86bQ13mnQ": "hey

it's the best price 55 for a gram of dabs 40 for a half gram cartridge as you guys know most of them are 60 and pharmaceutical rx is 70 dollars for a half gram cartridge and yeah they're good they're live resin but distillate 40 a half gram that ain't too bad i buy them every now and then so this is the review sour grapefruit sativa let's get it open there's a little safety seal tape right here on

oh Jesus is the strain there's an indica instead I did have looks that I had this before but I figured it was one of the nicer better carts on the menu today and they didn't have a lot because they're getting hit hard like I said that line was all the way down around the block and people were still coming in as I was leaving like you mean the line was still the same place it was one that started it took me I got there at 11 I got inside about 11:40 about a 40-minute wait outside I got inside it was another I want to say 10 or 15-minute wait inside and then till I got to the cashier a budtender

oh Jesus indica buy Cresco let me know if you guys had some bio Jesus before and I'll let you know a little bit more about what I thought in the comments section or maybe I'll do the two part video and give you the empty cartridge and what I thought at the end case you know something goes bad to taste gets nasty throughout or you know because when these sometimes any smoker cartridges it tastes good at the beginning and then it gets like a burnt taste or it starts messing up or something so we'll see we'll come back with a second video and give you the after a day of smoking it or so and it's almost down to the bottom I'll come back with a and I'll have it stitch the two together through the power of video so it'll be like a second for you guys but yeah so let me get another rip of

review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are going to be reviewing a cart from a company that i've seen around for some time i've seen them selling their flour at a lot of uh shops here in southern california especially the long beach area for it seems like a couple of years uh and now it looks like like a lot of folks they are branching out getting into other kinds of products um i know uh that this these people are now doing cartridges they're doing uh different concentrates and they are also doing tinctures of uh different varieties uh and what is that company that company is cresco cresco and this is their indica cartridge just uh nominally called rest it is their half uh gram cartridge 500 milligrams um and i picked this up for i actually couldn't tell you what the real cost was i it was uh some combination of purchasing this and one of their tinctures some kind of uh discount but i think they're a more affordable brand i think this is probably in the realm of like 20 to 25 for a half gram cart not too bad um in terms of packaging um it is uh refreshingly minimalistic not a lot of uh you know extra materials here just simple cardboard but all the information you want to see uh so the it is also in addition to being their rest line uh it is the critical purple push strain uh excuse me critical purple kush rather we all knew that and then you've got lab testing results there on the side a little sticker and then on the bottom you do have the um thc results and that comes in at 76.5 percent uh for 382 and a half percent or 382 milligrams of thc if that'll focus so uh this is pretty standard 510 fare here um uh no special pod or different kind of battery involved just your standard good old-fashioned 510 vape thread battery which you know feels to me like is uh becoming more and more of a uh a rarity to find uh the universal beloved 510 thread okay so we've ripped some tape off here at the bottom now we've got some push to do pushing pulling and there we go ah yes and this is a liquid live resin the uh still uh lost a little bit of its luster the term live resin not as much of a buzzword as it once was but still a lot of uh live resin devotees and this is apparently live resin uh and so here we are here is our cartridge design um got the plastic acrylic tip which is not my favorite uh but otherwise pretty standard looking 510 thread doesn't look like the nicest materials in the world but i don't think it's the most expensive cart either so let's go ahead and use my trusty 510 here as you know if you've watched me do some of these before i used to try to use nice 510 batteries uh to do these reviews with uh but for a variety of reasons i no longer do one because even the nice 510 batteries suck and they break down and then two i realized most people don't actually who are using these cartridges don't use a nice fancy online purchase battery they use the one that came free in the store the one that costs 10 bucks at the convenience shop or whatever they're not you know out there looking for the best so this is more uh in line with what a lot of people are experiencing uh not that this one's terrible just a standard 510 uh this one is raw garden branded i think it cost me like 12 bucks some number of months ago so uh without further ado let's go ahead and shut up and try this cresco uh critical purple kush half gram cart yummers wow yeah that is pretty good that is a pleasant surprise that that both hit harder than i thought um also came out more than that's a pretty nice hit for a um 510 thread and it was uh quite tasty it didn't taste like any added terpenes um tasted like your good old-fashioned full spectrum there wow yeah this is an unexpected trait this is pretty good stuff um i was not expecting to be as enamored with this as i am um super tasty it's very strong um this is a pretty remarkable amount of draw or um pardon the term cloud for such a small hit watch this not bad at all not bad um feels every bit of that advertise what was it 76 76 and a half percent for sure um and then again very very um nice flavor super smooth um and if you like your cartridges to have a very authentic non-added artificially terpene taste this is gonna do it for you wow this is uh a a nice little surprise i'm i'm quite enjoying this cresco liquid live resin uh and even the cartridge itself is is surprising me in terms of the kind of draws i'm getting here so let's get one board yum well this uh first half of this review is extremely positive but you know you're gonna have to stay tuned for the whole thing because here at wheats we don't just review the first half of our cartridges we do the whole gall darn thing um we do it from top to bottom so that i can come back to you guys give our whole thoughts let you know that the whole thing went through smoothly it never started to burn uh the wick didn't go out the uh didn't start to get clogged all those things that can go wrong with these uh 510 threads make sure we'll give it the whole wheat's review really really looking forward to uh doing so and uh i'm looking forward to come back in here coming right back here to report those results so i will see you guys right back here keep sitting right back here uh in probably a couple of days or so until then take care stay healthy and stay high my friends welcome back guys it has been about 60 hours two and a half days uh since i had started our journey with the cresco rest purple critical purple punch live resin cart uh and i still really enjoyed it uh this is a very good little cart um that oil is uh very quality stuff uh it tastes great um never got this super super hot burnt taste there at the end that you sometimes get you would get those sort of um uh they would burn a little bit hotter at the end but not nothing too much to worry about uh the one thing that i would say to be cautious of uh and i haven't had to say this in a while um is the thing that i brought up in the first half is uh there you're gonna get some unexpectedly big draws off of this uh i was very surprised uh more than once uh sort of devolved into a coughing fit because i took bigger draws than i um intended to i don't actually mean that as uh um a slight against it i i wish actually more carts uh had uh the ability you know you didn't have to uh draw as much on them to get such big hits but this one uh definitely does not have that problem so uh be careful if you're accustomed to other ones this one can give you a huge powerful hit without much effort uh it's not the oil is that much more powerful it's you know good oil but nothing crazy it's just that whatever this card design is airflow or whatever heating element uh causes much larger actual intake than normal uh but i did not think of that as a bad thing i just screwed up my implementation every now and then um so on the whole really really enjoyed this cresco rest critical purple push punch excuse me i assume they probably just have uh hybrid indica and sativa with the generic name but they have different strains it's like this is called the rest but it is also critical purple kush don't quite get that um but what i would get is this cartridge if i saw it again for an affordable price uh i'd love to try their one grams if they have them i'm not sure if they do or not but this half gram was a big thumbs up for me uh again that is the cresco liquid live resin indica rest cartridge pretty good stuff especially if you're a live resin fan well guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats thanks for staying tuned here till the very end it's been a blast hanging out with you and until our next review guys be sure to stay high and even more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you back here for the next video goodbye", "TqHotohh99U": "here [Music] beautiful [Music] all right what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another cartridge review but it is another buddies cartridge review but it is distilled cannabis oil and cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh i'm just gonna assume that this is gonna be tasting very similar to the raw gardens where it's distillate with live resin terps but then again i've never tried it yet but as you can see the the strain is zerple punch um the total cannabinoids is 87 and i do notice that the terpenes they still list on the back i do have an older one and let's just see uh the terpene profile on this one is a lot more it's almost more than double this one's about three percent terpene profile and this one's eight so that's what i noticed about this but we're gonna let rj open it or hold on yeah open it you know what i'm saying be on the lookout for the buddies for the buddy's cart hold on so that way you guys can go ahead and try this out yourselves let us know what you think about it to the side right here award-winning distillate it says features see sell surrender award-winning dude i mean it's got a gold medal all that good stuff right here and then i believe there's something on the bottom too or no oh no um go back to the back it shows the testing right here i believe the testing is from infinite chemical okay so open it up oh yeah and by the way subscribe to rj eats me if you have not already subscribe to simplicity [ __ ] all right i'm fine just rip it okay i don't want to like [ __ ] it oh there we go there we go got it pull it out for a little uh thumbnail okay it's back there we go all right so back to this camera we're going to try this out um from the looks of it very much similar to the raw guard a lot more yellow than the raw garden color right oh yeah yeah definitely what that one was more yellow than the last buddy yeah yeah that's what you're saying right no than the raw gardens oh this one see this is the regular buddies yeah so you can see it's hella more lighter yeah this one's distillate though so we're gonna see distill it with cannabis terps so so that's what you said it should be tasting like raw garden yeah uh that's what i'm assuming and also uh this is 28 out the door at authentic 209 which is arguably the cheapest well-known brand cartridge that i've seen so far 28 for buddies even if it's the distillate uh cannabis live resin terpenes or whatever still pretty good so or i haven't tried it yet so cheers be on the lookout but that 28 is not going to be priced at your location if you're exactly locating the 209 so damn sucks for you second it tastes like raw garden but less flavor because it might be the three percent terps that it comes with raw garden tends to have the same amount of terps as the the green buddies packaging um but not bad for 28 dollars you really can't complain i do i do like it but if i had to compare it it does taste like a raw garden but with a little bit less flavor it tastes better than last one yet yeah yeah you like this better than the real live resin one than this one really this is much stronger so with it being distillate and live resin terps in it uh distillate generally has a more uh higher percentage appears than you would get from a normal like regular live resin cart let me just bring this one out again so you can see right here total cannabinoids 78 no i'm saying so this one has a lot more well not a lot more like nine percent more um but this one has more terpenes so i would say this is more flavorful with more uh minor effects added with it with you know the the live resin terpenes there's just more of it and uh this one's just a little bit less in taste but uh a stronger hitting one that's probably why i liked it more yeah i mean nice good hit nice good high ready you know so i'm just basically like a waking bait for me you know i'm saying just got up like not 45 minutes ago so still concert like awake with me say that i do get a sweetness uh when i'm first inhaling it like like you definitely get like a candy taste i think it's because it's purple zunch or zunch purple whatever the [ __ ] it's called zurple punch but uh it's definitely not as smooth as the other light resin ones because with this delete it tends to be a little bit more harsher on the you would say but like i said subscribe to rj eats homie is investing in his camera [ __ ] you know what i'm saying i i'ma just say you right now i have never i mean i bought stuff from my camera but i've never bought like new lenses or anything so this just shows the amount of uh of a passion he's gonna put into this so [ __ ] i ain't damn i'm surprised that he that he bought all that [ __ ] but i'm i'm happy for him because hopefully getting all that stuff will motivate him to do content you know more content you know he's been doing content but when he gets all that stuff maybe it's just you know sparking his interest even more like a catalyst i won't even sleep anymore get off or go vlog be a monster but um so far you're going to see something i'll continue with what you're saying oh okay well um so far with this car do you like it i do yeah 28 that's why i like it yeah hell yeah which one by two maybe what i bought two i might just buy three [ __ ] they got all kinds of flavors i might just get interested and be like well [ __ ] i spent 50 on 2 grams i might as well spend me another 20 and just get me the 3 grams this is definitely a direct competitor to raw garden i know stizzy has the pods that are kind of the same too you know this method that raw garden popularized is slowly making its way around other companies i feel like you know raw garden was the first one to pioneer this i'm not too sure uh but their ones made it more popular you know what i'm saying but i'm gonna take another hit uh i don't know if randy's gonna take a hit but this will be the last one and uh yeah hopefully you enjoyed the video guys like comment subscribe all that good stuff if you want you know no one's forcing you here but cheers yeah cheers yeah being a lookout dang look out what are you doing what are you doing what are you talking about be on the lookout all right guys that's gonna be it for the video like i said subscribe to the homie link will be in the description below all that good stuff and uh we're gonna be doing another video today hopefully it's gonna be a successful random knot video because that other video we had we didn't really go to the point but we did see some weird [ __ ] but yeah subscribe all that good stuff peace out guys [Music] you", "avlYCguphSQ": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or I don't show you my personal information all right yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you um I have another court review for you guys in this video I'm actually doing a kind live resin again if you guys see my like last review I did a Arnold Palmer this is [ __ ] fire I haven't really smoked on the car too much besides for when I did the review because I'm trying I'm if you got yeah if you guys didn't know I'm going to ET see you in like two weeks like what is it May 17th so Loki trying to save this car gonna feel others for you wanna go easy because this car is like I said in that review it taste so far like it actually tastes like Arnold Palmer like it actually tastes like [ __ ] you're smoking lemonade and iced tea like I don't know it's [ __ ] fire but um this video we're gonna be reviewing true Oh G and this brand I mean not this brand um this flavour or strain or whatever you really want to call it I know it's kind of been I don't know if you want to say it's there one of the classics or originals or whatever but I know it's been around for like a really really long time like I seem like a YouTube video somewhere I forget the dudes Shanno or I would shout him out but um it was posted like literally four years ago and he was a reviewing kind live resin and it was true oh gee so yes that's just like a little proof that the true og flavor has been around for a while but I don't know this is my review so I'm gonna give you my thoughts opinions my honest review everything I had to say about it the Arnold Palmer one was a hybrid I think that was like I said sativa dominant hybrid if I'm correct and then the true oh geez I got heavy indica up here and the guy so just looking at the two parts they can look at the two you can already see you can see huge color difference that Arnold Palmer it's like a lot more like clear a lot more [ __ ] yeah a little gold you know what I mean the true OG is like that darker I don't want to say Brown but like like dark gold I don't know this I know it's throw some fire whatever this lit because I don't know I've known about this brand forever so I know it's a fire this lit the only thing that I don't like about them well I don't know I mean they're a little pricey they're like what 62 bucks for the four grand quarter there's like this brand right here I have some of review out on these like if you wanna go check them out too these are [ __ ] stupid fires but there's $70 for the full Graham Carter so these are a little bit cheaper than these but these are definitely more fire in my opinion there was a those are stupid fire but 70 bucks for a gram I can't really justify buying that you know what I mean the only reason I even bought these was because there was a buy one get one for a book I'd rather because I can get two grams of like actual concentrate like shatter for the price of one of the years you know and I'd rather have like actual wax but I don't know these are just good for like when you're going to raves like concerts or you know what I mean it's not like oh nice but yes you know you see the color difference but if you want to see review on the Arnold Palmer one go check that video out but like I said with the one true orgy in this video so let's just go over the packaging a little bit I can't waste too much time on it kind libraries and Ruo Jie yeah pretty basic the side of it says organic blah blah blah and then kind that's new ritual every video I have to [ __ ] drop something but it's you guys but if you guys have been watching my reviews dude I don't know why but I [ __ ] drop my cards and have you [ __ ] video for some reason but if you guys want to do some more research from the brand its kind concentrate song right there so check them out then it has like that Arizona warning on the side apartment of services coming back I don't mean just all that [ __ ] it has to say to cover their ass and that was it see another sticker right here oh it says uh natural sources supposedly they marketed as natural and organic so that's pretty far I don't know how true that is says solvent free natural and organic right there in the bottom two I don't know one of the one of the cons like that like if you wanted to make like a pros and cons list about these cards I mean I guess it's not really too big of a deal but as long as it's a thousand milligrams you know what I mean but I always loved it one like like I said on this large carts it says the THC percentage on the bottom I always love that these um Clank these cards the kind I don't at least from what I'm seeing I don't see any percentages it doesn't say what it's what it's tested at I mean as long as it's a thousand milligrams I guess it really doesn't matter you know what I mean so also what I not just noticed too briefly real quick I'm gonna get this out of the way and I'm we're gonna open this card of this Arnold Palmer one where's a harvested on for eleven nineteen so this is like some fresh or all right here this is brand new this one right here is harvested on eleven twenty eighteen so it's a little bit older a couple more months old I don't really think that has anything to do with the quality of it but I mean that's just pretty cool know when I got a fresh card you know I mean yeah besides for that let's just hop into the rest of this video so let's open this up oh gee off the top then it comes in these little plastic things not the nose in the box that's weird so when you take it out of the box that's you're greeted with you get this nice nice looking cart also another thing that I really like about these cards I mean I know a lot of cards have them so it's not only just this car like a lot like a lot of different brands do it well I mean I don't know I guess it's just all personal preference and also kind of depends on the battery you have but they're gonna say like the white accidents that use just because like when I put it on them this guy pin that I have just like blue one white I don't know it just looks so sick you know what I mean but um here's the quality the oil real quick so you guys could see the clarity of it in color let me find the bubble so there's the bubbler that you can see the consistency of it right there so it looks pretty thick it looks like it's barely even moving um if you guys haven't seen my past reviews I always say tell me down below in the comments what you guys think of the oil to lucas's even though this is my review and you guys are watching my review I'm like really really interested to know what you guys think of it too so make sure you tell me don't blow me comments what you guys think of it oh I think the other one was a little bit like the Arnold Palmer was a little bit thicker than this one is this one it's actually like moving up slowly the Arnold Palmer one was barely even moving but this is actually slighted input I don't know it's still really big oil that's a really good sign this is what it looks like on the pen it's a pretty big pin though I mean like so yeah this is a pretty big pin that's like the only downside of it like especially when you have a four grand card on it it's like good like I don't know six inches maybe you don't [ __ ] know how big that is but um here's the quality of the oil one more time for you guys stupid clear like you see just a little dark that's literally like the only thing I could say about it but besides I mean like the color that the color has to do a lot of things you know what I mean it could do with the strain a weed they like the strain they used to make though or or it could do it there's so many possibilities unlike what could affect the actual color the distillate you know what I mean so don't really like just use that to judge the so yeah if you guys like to know just don't use that that's like your main source of like judging a car just like the color of it you know what I mean because there's so many different like things that could like affect that like so many different variables I could affect the color you know what I mean so so we got the trilogy no I don't know that is a little upsetting that doesn't have the THC percentage on it to be honest so but anybody from kind is watching this I mean I should say a little detail that I'll really cut like a lot more if you guys add it on your packages but like I said it's not too big of a deal but let's just turn this on and get our first couple hits I'm gonna preheat the battery up a little bit get it ready for us to hit it let me just uh voltage so I have it on like a pretty low temperature like just a little like 2 2 point 7 volts so pretty low so you guys are smoked if I didn't mention it I should have added it into the beginning of this video but if I didn't don't watch this video that's for 18 21 or whatever little you were ages Smokey's in the area or you have your medical marijuana card like I do oh yeah I just have to say that [ __ ] to cover my ass but you should hop back into this if you guys are smoking along with me Cheers um and yeah just get into this true OG client library and choose I definitely add that og wish taste oh yeah all right of it even though I'm not I'm not too old I'm not like a og I'm saying not how old I had a nuttin but I've been smoking for a minute um I haven't had a G cush for a minute so I don't know you don't really see too much like real OG Kush now anymore like in the area that I live there's so much like exotic [ __ ] and like I don't know I just feel like that's a new wave it's like exotic strains and that means you know you don't really see too much of the classic like Oh green crack like [ __ ] ogee curve like you know all the og [ __ ] you know what I'm saying you'd only see that too often no more you just see a lot of the exotic stuff so it's pretty like I'm nostalgic to say the least like the hidden some og [ __ ] like that it actually tastes like some fire oh gee it's some real live resin too which is really really like another nice thing about the car and just like the static of it like especially on this pen I mean you can put it even on like the average loss is my evo labs pan this is like a also one of my favorite pens I love this pin so much even on this pin like this [ __ ] looks [ __ ] badass like just black and white you know and this pen actually has on three temperature settings it has a low medium and hot so we're good I have it on the low temperature right now so I guess let's just move this we're gonna heat it up yeah it's preheating for me right now [Music] tastes Oh fire yeah the taste gets a five out of five right off the bat the way it smokes you see I'm barely ripping it I'm blowing clouds it gets a five out of five for the way he smokes it [ __ ] rips my smoked a little bit before I made this video but I'm definitely [ __ ] like I wanna hit this what two or three times so far I mean I'm already higher than I was when I started this video so yeah I mean it's definitely some [ __ ] hope we're not [ __ ] you know what I mean um so these carts should definitely fire but the price of them is they're cheap within the select parts that's a good thing but there's still a little pricey if they were about like 55 bucks I think that'd be a better price point but 62 was a little bit expensive in my opinion for a ground you guys ever tried on time live resin time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think of it and um I don't know if you guys are liking these like um Medical Marijuana reviews or like we train our views or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call these and you have any other recommendations or constructive criticism or anything like that you guys want to tell me time we don't blow in the comments read every single comment I try to reply to every comment I can or at least majority of them or at least like favorite them or you know let me do something I'm always trying to show as much love back to you guys as you guys showed to me because it's like honestly like without you guys that wouldn't really be [ __ ] I mean I'm not really the biggest youtuber right now but still without you guys I wouldn't be nothing you know I mean but so if you guys ever hit me put my Instagram you guys see I always hit you guys back and show as much love as I can so I mean yeah I really do appreciate you guys showing all the love and support you guys do like it honestly doesn't go like for like unseen like I really do appreciate it I'm not making that up but if you guys like really like these videos um the card reviews aren't stuff like that time we don't blow in the comments I've just been like [ __ ] so insanely busy it's been crazy working 40 hours a week trying to do this YouTube stuff keep my Instagram pages active like if you didn't know I have a page where I resell some FTP clothes in the street like that and there's some other stuff so I have so much [ __ ] I'm trying to work on at once while I'm doing [ __ ] 40 hours a week at work and then I figure I said I didn't know I got a [ __ ] DUI for medical marijuana so I got a I'm on probation for that so I'm doing dealing with a bunch of [ __ ] but uh so I'm just [ __ ] insanely busy right now but these videos are just kind of easy for me to record and get out like kind of fast you know what I mean that's what I've been doing them but um we'll have more reaction videos out soon hopefully so if you guys want to see them and you have any requests for us then we don't blow in the comments but definitely this car is definitely fires [ __ ] if you ever um if you ever see a kind live resin in your area I recommend definitely picking them up definitely if they are and if they have a buy one get one free deal like they have when I got these definitely pick them up because it's a [ __ ] steal I don't see why you wouldn't um don't smoke none of those fake hearts going around that's for sure we're all square I'll give this like a four out of five I mean what I said I meant to say a 4.5 out of 5 so like half a point away from a perfect score just for the fact being that they're like a little pricey like I said if they were around like that fifty five dollar mark that'd be a lot more like I don't know I just think that'd be like a better price point for them I mean I don't know I mean the worth is 662 dollars you know what I'm saying but just me personally I don't like spending that much money on just one gram because like I said I can get two grams of should have it for that price but I think 55 bucks should make it a better deal and I think they'd probably sell a lot more cards than they do now if they lowered the price a little bit but yeah that's just my honest review so four point five out of five that's the overall score pace five out of five the way it smokes five out of five I pretty much everything gets a five out of five except for the price point the price point gets a four out of five so that's the only reason it gets like a four point five out of five and I like I said I still have a couple other cards I could review there's a lot of other like dope dispensaries around me there's actually like a kitchen where they make like edible hamburgers and [ __ ] like that pizza so I can make a video there if you guys want um just really anything you guys want me to do is help me down below in the comments but yeah these carts are stupid fired four point five out of five final reading I know I said that a bunch so I'm in the video here let me hit this one more time to see if I have anything I want to tell you guys before in the video and then we'll just ended off that so the flavor on that is so good though like that it tastes so [ __ ] good just if you ever see them in your area definitely pick them up and if you ever tried them down below in the comments for you guys sing at them but 4.5 out of 5 like I said and besides for that it's been Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it slides for that you already know peace out", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks for watching brothers and sisters leave me a comment let me know what you think you like the strain you try to before you don't like the strain let me know why you don't like it you think I'm right think I'm wrong I read all your comments I reply to them all I love it while you're here click Subscribe I'm going to be making videos all the time might as well be the first one to see them so till next time I hope you're all taking staying safe taking care of each other and above all everyone keeps smoking", "-LOgUO7XJMU": "[Music] what's up guys simply secure and back with another video we got our NJ takes a picture Jimmy no RJ eats subscribe to the home he's about 580 right now let's get him to 600 should be a easy goal you know I'm saying but this is not about RJ even though he's in here subscribe to him but but if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge and this is by far the cheapest live resin cart that I was able to get my hands on I did give money to Randy cuz he stopped by the club yesterday and he bought it for me I've been mowing him the money and he got it from me but this is buddies and this was for 30 to 50 and this is about the cheapest live resin car I've ever like received or not received but and yeah I've tried buddy's before so nothing like special or new here but it is a new strain it is a lien push can you open it hold on we're gonna have a Randy open it not right now I'm gonna oh it shows the back first so these are the terpenes that are on there as you know with buddies and you can see right there on the right it says manufactured April 3rd that's by April 3rd 2021 all that good stuff you know just talking a monoids 280 7.39 on that alright let's go just get this pop oh and baby just come of it yeah so you can see very similar to the select cartridge I've had a buddy's cartridge before guys so hold on thumbnail right here hey there we go all right my ugly askin to or not it's a bad habit but a lot of people do and trying to start the bad [ __ ] done better anyways but you can see right here it's very much similar to the cartridge type of select but this is alien cush so I'm interested to see if this tastes like [ __ ] uh thank the lemon salt stuff that everything's been tasting like I hope not even though I like the taste of that is not bad it's just you know I'm kind of like all right kind of taste something different so was the first time you tried buddy's cars only like five four or five months ago so I've had it before they definitely run out quick these cartridge types the they go out quick turn it off we're gonna take a blinker so they don't last as usual as long as like a water and probably like a short like a day or two earlier it would run out on me but cheers boys popping a session below what you guys just smoking up let us know man always keep us updated to keep us in the mix we want to know man you know I saw some strains you guys are commenting on the other day kind of forgot honestly all the names oh well that's a hitter and yes the cartridge hits and apparently it says these are ceramic coil carts as well so that's a that's probably why it tastes very very much it's a tasty experience that's probably like looking resort so a real stoner high then this is the wood good starter huh just good tastes good it doesn't taste like the light like like an OG Kush it is alien Kush you know so it definitely has the more flour taste and then the more citrusy taste that you would generally get from sativas or everything else on the market you know saying but that was a good hair right yeah excuse me boys let me take another hit and we're probably gonna call it a video after he gets another hit and he's gonna do a blinker no blinker I got not beat so hot from the room that had a good level huh just so you guys don't think don't believe me with the 3250 program I'm gonna show you it's a dirty price huh for live resin that's a very good price and you know this this video is not gonna come out until like a week or two so I don't know if they're still gonna have it but I will show you the proof right now just so you guys believe me and it's not all talk you might make the drive from where you're at just to get like you know she's in product yeah so 32:54 the alien cushion 30 to 50 for the blue skittles as well so cheering yeah but yes stay tuned we're also gonna be doing another video with money I know you guys have been requesting money or aka be cheapened because he can take fat hits that hits the ones that you like to see you know I'm saying like he will take those packets and yeah my homie don't give a [ __ ] so I'm gonna take one more hit how do you like this cartridge so far 8250 would you buy it and consider buying it for 30 to 50 yes I would anything higher than that probably not it was more than 40 I probably not go ahead and buy a cart unless I know it was beating some fire I'm saying this is I don't know definitely it you can spend basically happy oh yeah you can split that in half in at 2 grabs with some wax spend another $3 each you know on each one you get some decent good wax yeah but as a cartridge person once again he's getting price on the cartridge yeah I'd buy it for that price that's a good-ass price on the it for grams - that's not you're spending like half a gram sometimes almost at same price for even just a little less so that already tells you that's a good purchase you know yeah yeah definitely what's go in and buy something like that if I was looking to buy a car okay that's good to hear we are gonna end the video here guys hopefully you enjoyed it subscribe all that good stuff like the video if you enjoyed it subscribe to rj eats and see you guys the next one [Music]", "XngLtlXh0bg": "yo hey guys

view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "jZ6x8shCQqI": "- PO Boxes you're gonna be doing a video today for you guys I really hope you guys are doing good it is Wednesday afternoon today I'm just kicking back - I was just wondering you know what do you guys prefer you live residents really hot right now really popular now compared to distillate which distillate pretty good you know don't get me wrong it's still [ __ ] fire but a lot of people been saying you know distillate get you a little bit more higher than live resin or I don't know it just depends but they say live resins way WAY tastier than distillate but this really gets you higher than live resin so here we have a live resident Stiggy what a distillate is your regular stays you know that means hopefully you guys got a close-up on the tasty percentage so one has more CBD than the other one so that's pretty interesting as well so let me know what you guys prefer a live resin or a distillate you know pretty curious about that so we're gonna see you know to me I honestly I love both I [ __ ] with distillate a lot to me honestly I love distillate since dizzy came out it's one of my favorite distillate cartridges or applause whatever you want to call it plug and play and there's just other some other distillate cartridges are pretty fire out there but here we have a live residence tizzy this was a this was a living cookies you know I did a review on it but I haven't dropped it it's just I've been really really busy you know it means daughters coronavirus [ __ ] going on but if you guys haven't noticed live resin is way darker than actual distillate is as you guys can see this little a way lighter than what a live resin is so you know first when I seen a live resin cartridge or a pod I was like what the [ __ ] you know cuz it's way way darker so that it was like one of my first times I had try live resin so it was way darker so I was like kind of sketched about it but you know they taste really really good they taste fresh like most of life resin cartridges are really dark you know dark amber color compared to like a rocker which is really light but the but the taste on it is way way different but so today we're gonna do comparison table I'm gonna take a blink round of both of them and I'm gonna hold it in and see which one will choke me out a little better to see which one will get any high so first off we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and hit this regular distillate sativa cartridge it's a Sour Diesel as you guys can see I've gotten out of my dispensary in the fake [ __ ] you know it's good to spend extra money on the legit cartridge guys you know to make sure you guys are smoking no [ __ ] so we're gonna go ahead and take a blink out of this distillate pot and I'm going to let you guys know if it's better than the library cheers guys if you guys are smoked a lot let me go ahead and do so [Music] those who know distillates dizzy pods are always [ __ ] fired the blinkers ain't as bad as a plug-and-play but the blinkers on the stasis are [ __ ] fire you know all you need is like maybe one blinker or two and you're good so the oil on the dizzies on the regular distillate they're really thick compared to a life resin after couple hits the live resin the library will run way way more than what a distillate when you know what I mean so if you were to flip it upside down after hit a night it will you know the oil will go upside down real quick so I'm feeling pretty high running off the distal ahead so we're gonna let him show you guys a close-up on the life resin one as you guys can see it's darker as I was saying so I suggest to see the California little sticker but they say you know don't be sketched about it you know if you guys get life rising cartridges and they're darker just because you got smoked rock garden and they're little lighter doesn't mean they're good you know but like rock garden is far but I'm just giving you guys an example you know just because it's darker doesn't mean it's bad but I take a hit of this life resident cartridge and we're gonna applaud whatever I just get mixed up by same pot and cartridge but we're not going to see what's the difference on it so I'm gonna take a blink row this life resin this is the lemon cookies I'm gonna see how it tastes [Music] Wow now the taste on it it's really fired to be honest the THC percentage it's a little lower than the distillate but the feeling you get on the throat is way different it's more like if you took a DAB like an actual diet and the taste on it it tastes so better it tastes it tastes so clean like it tastes like if you actually took like a DAB you know like the smell of it like you can literally taste like the actual terpene in it you know compared to the distillate you know the d\u00e9sol\u00e9e it does taste good but you do get like a little fakeness taste to it compared to life resin but it tastes pretty good you know I'm going to take another hit you know that's how good it is if you guys haven't had the lemon cookie you guys time how the lemon cookie won this one's pretty far ready going now to take another hit off to the [ __ ] taste so bitter [Music] but the light resident does run out a little faster than the distillate guys now now that we hear both of them honestly it's up to preference if you guys prefer life resin go ahead and drop a like or whatever let me know in the comments section of you guys prefer live resin or a distillate cartridge to me honestly I smoke any one it just depends you know I'm not really picky when it comes to smoking cartridges as long as they taste good and get any high as [ __ ] I'm good with that but that doesn't mean I'll get like the cheapest [ __ ] but you know I just like to try new [ __ ] not like I'll let you guys know if it's fire but to me honestly I'll [ __ ] with both but let me know what you guys preferred so now that we tried both of them it's time to abuse the share of these bad boys let's go ahead and hit both of them at the same time oh wow catcha is really good you know I see a lot of people that carry two batteries at the same time it's just one of them [ __ ] up so I had to get another one but ended up working all of a sudden so now I have to so that's pretty dope I really hope you guys stay safe out there while she got his hands coronavirus a [ __ ] so don't really want you guys to end up and catching it and nothing like that so you guys be safe out there take care of supra-conscious and you know and drop a like and comment what you guys would like to see next but peace guys", "0EW65sp5ePg": "hey what's good everybody jpegming here checking in live respectmyregion.com here today with a west coast suite tour review featuring the cure companies diablo og one gram high potency thc distillate cartridge so we're looking at 98.22 total cannabinoids on this product 94 thc uh specifically 94.7 percent thc delta 9 at 94.66 so high potency high potency high potency that's what this product is all about superior quality cannabis goods i'll show you guys some of the packaging here it's cool black white logo got the extracts added in there to stand out diablo og is a classic og strain you can get some of the testing information there on the back we've got this pretty cool reflective superior quality cannabis goods thing there and a bunch of information on the back i'd like to see the genetics i'd like to see the terpenes but they're not listed it does say that the ingredients have 100 premium cannabis distillate extract so i do like that um are the terpenes botanical or the terpenes cannabis who knows how to use attached cartridge to 510 thread battery take three second draw exhale repeat as needed so today we're going to use the vessel battery i've got um it's set on the lowest temperature we're going to see if that's enough to get the distillate to fire up um child proof packaging is currently working on me though let me try to get this open ah there we go all right so check this out you guys beautiful got this white uh ceramic tip the glass window here to see the actual oil that we got clear rubber coverings and stoppers on the mouthpiece and on the coil down at the bottom where the connector meets the battery so i'll kind of show you guys this a little closer check that out it's a beautiful product i can't really smell anything through the tip it does have a little bit of red ringage going on the top so looks like the terpenes have definitely been doing a little bit of reacting but we shall see how this tastes you guys can see that color a little bit there at the top a little bit concerning so here we go one two three four five oh one two three four five turn the vessel back on beautiful there we go all right one two three here we go one hit review talk about it i'll do a second hit give you guys a score out of ten we're supposed to do baby let's go it rips it's smooth it tastes good i do love the branding of the car i love how the cure company put their logo on the actual glass of it i think that's super dope but taste wise it's pretty decent earthy sweet spicy not a little not too much pine there's some lavenderiness with some linalool in there for sure i enjoy it i enjoy it i'll need to do a second hit to see if it's really going to be at this 98 you know total cannabinoids i'm not super duper high right now um run it here we go again i'm tasting that little there's a nice soft lavenderiness to this got a little bit of pine on tiny bit on that last one but the most part just getting that earthiness just getting this spice tiny tiny tiny bit of floral pine and a lot a lot of lineal in there this lavender-ness and so i really enjoy it i am concerned about this ring at the top when you think about the packaging date it was back in it was manufactured in january 21 2020 the date of the packaging of this product so when they stuck the card into the packaging um what was it july 16 2020 so there's a clear difference that's that six months difference i don't know what happened here with this but definitely concerning [Music] you know cartridges are tricky um but i definitely feel like merchandising and making sure that you know the product quality stays consistent i feel like that's totally achievable but as you guys can see there is some really strong discoloration let me pull the sticker off here for you guys there is very much a strong discoloration um at the very top of all that distillate and so because of that i'm definitely gonna have to give them a score in the low you know uh between a five and a six to be honest i think the product quality when it comes to the flavor the high the way that it's branded and packaged and the high thc nature i think all that adds up to an experience that should be very good um but we definitely want to make sure that we're keeping people safe and or making sure that their questions are uneasiness uh those kinds of things are not you know taken care of and or these kind of problems are just non-existent so because of that and this specifically five to six out of ten super rough score but you know like i said uh just make sure you guys talk to the bartender always ask to see the packaging day always ask to see the harvest date for a lot of things that'll help you guys avoid getting product that might be bad expired or going bad or whatever it is so jfing here coming at you guys live man west coast week 2 review we keep it real we keep it honest it's not always great but it's good feedback so i love you guys i'll see y'all down the road 5.6 five to six five point six whatever y'all want to do out of ten care company i'll see y'all down the road love you guys peace", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video

uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "A6fBjd1I3Dc": "[Music] hello and welcome to wheat's the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your dispensary today we are out here in sunny beautiful long beach we're gonna maintain about six feet of distance looks pretty open here got our mask just in case we got a phone call which we will decline but we'll keep rocking and rolling uh so what are we out here to do today we are out here to review a product as we like to do on wheats we are taking a look at a uh product from a company we've reviewed before but never their cartridge and that is buddies buddies distilled cannabis oil and cannabis derived terpenes cartridges this is their one gram captain kush indica cartridge which i picked up for a scant 36 dollars at a dispensary in long beach california which is pretty emblematic of buddies products in general they are usually pretty affordable for being pretty good quality so i hope that is also true for these cartridges like their capsules we've reviewed um so as i said this is their uh captain cush indica strain for 36 bucks on the back we've got a nice big table with all kinds of lab testing information uh and we can see on the front it has 82.72 total cannabinoids that's a little misleading because the thing you really kind of care about is that number next to it which is the thc percentage which is still a very respectable 78.6 percent thc all that other stuff is uh various different terpenes cannabinoids they even have a terpene profile layout there on the back for your viewing pleasure um standard 510 cartridge uh for this made by the people at sea cell technology they make a lot of the nicer i guess vape tanks which is an encouraging sign um so let's go ahead and open up this captain kush and give it a try pretty standard issue packaging which i'm a fan of don't need a lot of materials we got cardboard and a little plastic tube on the inside and then we've got the actual capsule excuse me cartridge itself nice looking oil very yellow very very yellow light oil um but out here in this hot sun nice and viscous let's take off these caps put in our plastic bottle just throw away later and let's put it on our standard 510 now and give our buddies captain kush our first hit oh okay so nice um intake design the c-cell sort of uh standard cartridge design a lot of intake holes uh nice heating element does the job uh it's got the plastic sort of acrylic tip not my favorite in the world but um nicer than some of the others that i've tried no qualms there um for 36 bucks this is a very nicely designed cartridge uh in terms of design and then more importantly in terms of what's inside that uh tank uh wow it's pretty good i um i don't think i've ever had captain kush before just sort of grabbed this one off the shelf um very neutral tasting weed not a lot of flavor in either direction kind of more of a piney taste i guess uh if i had to describe it with anything but very smooth uh very qui high quality tasting oil actually no complaints yeah very [Music] got to watch out you can't really taste it there's actually such little flavor there uh you could take much bigger hits than you're used to without without much effort because the uh sort of terpene profile for this one at least doesn't doesn't have much of a taste which is not necessarily a bad thing um i i like a little bit of flavor but i know people who hate any kind of weed taste sort of hold their nose at the whole experience um this one has very light [Applause] it's like just like warm air with a slightly piney aftertaste um not bad at all the oil itself is quite quality um so far for a 36 dollar cartridge this is a real win for buddies man um happy with the oil happy with the design happy with the uh not super ostentatious packaging pretty big win so far but it's a whole gram we got a gram to get through and that's going to take us more than just this session here it's probably going to take me about five or six days or so to get through this and once i do just like all our wheats reviews i'll come right back to you guys let you know exactly if this buddies cartridge is as good as we're all hoping make sure it doesn't burn doesn't just sort of fizzle out on us all those kind of things that can happen anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two that was awkwardly said welcome back guys welcome to wheats uh it has been about almost five days since our first check-in with buddies captain cush uh their distilled cannabis oil and cannabis-derived terpenes and uh that does bring something up my brain was a little fried before it was so hot out there i forgot to talk more about distilled cannabis oil uh in the cannabis derived terpenes what what exactly that means um what i assume buddies is means by this is they are using what is known as distilled cannabis oil just like it says uh and that is a distilled cannabis oil is um a an oil a process of extracting only one particular molecule basically of a um of the plant so in this case exclusively thc you leave all the other cannabinoids and terpenes behind and just extract that but uh they do so this is uh 78.65 thc and as i said before it is seven 82.72 percent total cannabinoids uh those extra uh four percent are the um various terpenes that they add in and they do helpfully show you sort of on the back a breakdown of all of the various terpenes not really focusing there but that's not the point um so that is what makes that up because again there are no other terpenes in this because if it is a distilled cannabis oil it's only one thing they're distilling in this case thc and all the other uh terpenes are added but they do say that they are cannabis derived so they should be natural whatever that means i just thought i'd fill you in a little bit more on that but before we um give our final thoughts here's our cartridge uh our oh my god captain kush i just about finished it i left a little bit there for us to do a couple while we're wrapping up here so with this buddies uh i've got to say this is getting a pretty nice thumbs up from me uh this is a good value cartridge all around it is not my favorite on any individual metric for sure but uh for a 36 dollar one gram cartridge uh using what seems like pretty good ingredients um pretty decent tech the whole cartridge has that very and uh once you understand why it's distilled uh you can maybe understand why it has that such neutral flavor i always mentioned even with those added terpenes in there uh still pretty neutral uh tasting um you may find that whatever way i i kind of enjoyed it uh so yeah solid cartridge design um solid oils again not the best on any single metric but for 36 bucks i'm i'm pretty pleased with uh this buddy's captain kush uh i i have no problem recommending it if uh you find it at the right price for you as well uh that's two for two for buddies here on weeds um and uh whenever we get something we like this much we want to do a little cherry on top a little something extra not weed related a little just something you can you know take with you and uh you know put in your back pocket to keep for later not that's what you should do with the chair on top you should pretty much just eat that but we're mixing metaphors here too i'm high um so what are we uh cherry on topping this week well it's not exactly buddies like uh not keeping the theming similar because this is more of a premium product and that's the good old ipad pro holy [ __ ] uh finally got a new ipad pro had a first gen um it's been a while since i've upgraded any apple product um but the new ipad pro is amazing um actually the review you're watching is almost certainly edited just on imovie exclusively through the ipad pro how cool is that it takes me like 30 seconds to do that's an exaggeration but it doesn't take long it's great i actually really enjoy doing it that way the ipad pro it's beautiful um but you know if you like apple products if you don't you're gonna hate it you know whatever um but uh if you've been needing an excuse to upgrade uh or find an excuse for a luxury purchase ipad pros 2020 is a pretty sexy product and with that guys that's going to do it for our buddies captain kush big old thumbs up and our ipad pro 2020 i'm sorry it's not a sand big old thumbs up uh and that's gonna do it for everything here on wheats thank you so much for watching guys it's been a real pleasure hanging out with you on our live streams recently i hope you tune in for those in the future we've been doing quite a few uh until then until we see on the next review or live stream or whatever stay high but more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you guys later goodbye", "5m_Q461PXxo": "you tube guys whoa all right last second man I wasn't even gonna make a video today today's Friday users are probably gonna see this within the next couple of hours after I make this video man maybe an hour too after I'm gonna hurry up and try to edit this and pump this out guys and I wasn't even gonna do a video today like I said man but just cuz I've been so busy this week I have midterms this week I've had work I've had been busy taking care of my family you know you guys know the deal man you guys know the deal when it comes to being busy like the things like things like this really aren't much of a priority to say the least but like you know this is just a hobby but all right guys as you guys can tell by the title of the video man just hop into the review because I don't want to be yapping around and [ __ ] like that so we're gonna hop straight into the review man and this has been a long waited like I swear how long has it been since like someone has asked for this video it's been a long time dude like to be honest it's been a long time like I think when I first started my youtube channel people were started and we're asking for this cartridge at that time so it's been almost a year since I have made a in my youtube channel I think it's been a year I'm not even too sure if but yeah man we're gonna get started Los Angeles kushman hometown man if you guys don't know I'm from Los Angeles man like straight out of the hood Inglewood [ __ ] like that and then I was raised up until I was there like 4 4 or 5 and I moved to another city and then we got raised up there but I'm originally from LA man I gotta send love to my hometown city bro so today guys the flavor in particular wouldn't be trying to is strawberry blondie and this was I try to do as much research as possible or try see what cartridge was the best one that they had and from from what I saw people were saying that the strawberry blondie was out of this world so this is brand new I haven't even tested it I literally got it probably five to ten minutes ago so we're just gonna do a first [ __ ] like hands on so let's see what's up so when you get it this is a packaging it comes in a little blue box and on the side right here imma show you guys all of this right now in a bit so it comes in a little wipe pouch it says Los Angeles cush on it and then we might have to take some photos of this [ __ ] or something los angeles cush and then this is a lot of the box like I said and then I'm gonna give you guys a little up close there let's see manufactured in La Vie that vat of it on 128 19 which is January packaged on two 13 19 and expires 128 21 so total THC 7785 let's see CBD 1.60 total terpene concentrate alright guys and this right here is a little close-up of the oil it doesn't really look like a full gram to be honest I mean these cartridges might be a little bit bigger than others but it doesn't really look like they give you a full gram they definitely didn't hit this because it was still inside the the sealed packaging so I wish I had a scale to weigh this out and things like that but I'm gonna take it into consideration and just hope that la cush really is giving you one gram but it looks very very clear kind of reminds me of the raw garden it's a very very nice video so now that you guys can see how clear that oil is it's pretty honestly this has to be some of the clearest distillate I've seen yet and not come like I said in the last of a not compared to raw garden dude raw garden and refined live resin is a whole different thing so this is by far one of the clearest I've ever seen so alright and I really like the packaging so far the white tape the whole sea salt thing is very very nice and I'm gonna try it on the rock garden battery first because it looks pretty nice man it looks like it fits very very nice like it's just one long white stick so we're gonna be taking like I said this is the first impression so I'm really really stoked about this and like even though they're a hometown brand I've never even considered trying them just because I was like LA cuz you know it's probably over hi brand because if they're just local you know locals always hype up their their local [ __ ] supporters things like that so cheers guys we're gonna be taking the hits off of this right now just gotta get straight into the video man I feel like I'm rambling too much so I gotta get straight into the video so if you guys are 18 over 21 and over you guys know the deal man and cheers boys os definitely that is delightful dude this thing has me coughing like crazy so right off the bat off of the first hit it wasn't really too much of a hit but I got a very very strong strawberry not like it doesn't taste artificial at all but definitely doesn't taste natural or it does taste natural but then again like I'm trying to figure a way to explain this but like it's like how strawberry smell is what I'm tasting you know so that's kind of that's kind of different but we're gonna take another rip and see what's up so yeah definitely getting this thing is good all right so now that I that second hit was a little bit more artificial than it was naturally it tasted more kind of like strawberry strawberry Fanta it has like a really really strong strawberry fan to taste to it in my personal opinion whoo but the high is very nice dude for two hits that I just took I'm already getting a head change I'm feeling my eyes getting a little bit low this is an indica dominant strain so I'm gonna and like plus me working ten hours today there's no why no like plus Eddings indica is like go to sleep dude and so that was the rock garden battery we're gonna be trying it on the slim twist so get that on there whoo airflow is nice bro so we're gonna start this off at three point three and then see see what's up with it so if you guys are smoking along with me let me know what you guys are smoking in on in the comments below and if you guys are enjoying the video so far man just hit that sub hit that sub button and let your homies know to to hit that sub button also so cheers yes Wow dude like this is definitely this is very very enjoyable like even though it doesn't taste like naturally like strawberries it does have that artificial taste it can pass as if it was like strawberry weed and um don't quote me on this I'm not too sure what the strains are in this I'll make sure and put that in the description below you guys know I always got you guys with that like but is this amazing dude this thing this car is definitely about 100 percent cup like I'm definitely happy that I was able to try this out and give it my initial thoughts and we're just gonna keep ripping it and then keep ripping it and then tell you guys what the full effect is I mean I'm not even too sure how many hits already taking but it's a very nice high so far and I haven't taken many so Wowz is dude not even gonna like the high on this is so good so good oh the more you hit it it's like a very refreshing drink of strawberry soda it's not it's not a bad though it's good it's amazing like alright where is it where has this been all my life ever I would have tried this months ago this definitely would have been on my top-five list this definitely is getting bumped up to number two right now so right now guys raw garden and then Los Angeles cush and then West Coast cured but this this right here this distillate right here is some of the best some of the best for sure I haven't tried any other but better just looking this and it keeps going better and better as I try a new of products like some guy some guy I've commented below and he said he said this I think he said um oh you think every new cartridge that you try is better and I'm like yeah dude cuz like it a new cartridge you never know what you're gonna get you know it can either be shittier than the last one you tried it could be better it can't or it could be just up I mean I've never really had a cartridge that's the same level as the other cartridge so you know that's that's my thoughts like I always try new things that I think is better than other things and I'm not gonna sit here and think that those old things are the best forever you know I'm always trying to find new product I'm trying to find new things for you guys especially because you guys always have questions about Oh what what should I cut what should i do I don't want to waste my money that's what I'm here for man this is what I'm here for like things like this like go cop this go cop this for sure I'm gonna take one more hit imma do the official review on this for you guys so yes can decide if you want to go cop it or not so who like this thing is gave me stone I'm gonna switch it to the raw garden battery because it was a really really smooth it off of it man this weather change got me with a little like the allergies my nasal congested dude freaking coughing horrible so we're to take one last hit like I said and then when you get to the final review guys cheers I'm like I said I'm happy that I picked this out this is by far some of the best distillate so amazing room sheesh man this is like another level of higher right here this is so amazing let me get into detail right now so all right so a initial taste I already said it tastes kind of like a strawberry soda Fanta it's not too dominating so don't they you're gonna get an overpowering ly strong strawberry taste it's very very subtle but you can definitely taste it and depending on how your palate is you know the way you tasting is it kid it can be you could like it or you can't but for the most part in my personal opinion I feel like you should like it as a consumer of thta's like if you guys like most of the things that I reviewed in the past you guys are definitely gonna like this one like this off the tops is taking over the best distillate this is from Oh taking over Stacey it's been taking over West Coast Cara like I said top distillate by far and you heard it from me and then so the high it's a very very very soothing dude it doesn't automatically just pop just hit you and then you're automatically like super stone you know you don't get it enjoy it go go like a level up level up you just cut you know there's been things like that and like this this cartridge right here dude it like you take one one hit I mean it gets you a head change you know it gets you a head change and that's what I like about it get your head changer that my I start feeling a little bit heavy definitely getting that indica right away and that coughing sensation who it man I killed like on that second hit if you guys go back in on the video and notice it I couldn't even hold that hittin I can't hold it in like that's how strong it is very very potent that turps are super super flavorful man there they hit you in the back of the throat along with the strawberry and it's like it's just a conjunction of just flavorful miss man it's amazing so Los Angeles Kush you've outdone yourselves man I'm definitely gonna be copying you products um I want to try the ill oh gee and then the Burberry cheesecake is next on the list - man I'm gonna be doing some more Lakers for you guys if you guys like this video man imma ended up here go cop the LA Kush and if you guys enjoyed today's video make sure you guys go leave a like comment sub and I just wanted to say man rest in peace Nipsey Hussle man true legend out there he did a lot for me growing up I just want to speak on this as an innovator cuz he did die on them on Sunday which is very tragic like I said hometown legend for me and he was like someone that I looked up to growing up because he was a very very motivational man he always gave that word out to like be better for yourself like it doesn't matter where you come from if you like he even showed everybody he was from the hood he was from the straight up like hood bro like Slauson like the where the bad [ __ ] happens about and he made it out multi-millionaire this dude was Boston up he just bought his own like that little store that he used to kick it out in front of he just about that whole entire building really the things he was doing was were out of this world he was true a true motivation that a lot of people should look up to instead of looking up to these other people that really aren't doing much but talking about money girl weed and [ __ ] like that so yeah rest in peace Nipsey Hussle man true legend imma have to get a tattoo for him soon bro so if like I said if you guys enjoyed the video make sure you leave a like comment sub and we're out", "zrQKILuOYfc": "welcome to blue crayon extracts today I'm going to show you a little bit about our products or CBD babe cartridge product it's full spectrum CVE has 750 milligrams of CBD in the 1000 milligram cartridge and then we also have a 500 milligram cartridge that contains 375 milligrams of active CBD that's roughly around 3.75 milligrams per puff depending on how big your puffs sizes are and then same goes for the 750 milligrams CBD cartridge it's about seven point five milligrams per possible on average so I open up the little container here and inside I have the USB mini charger the battery battery sold separately but you know we we ship it in the in a box like this but then you can put it inside your container which is kind of handy and then we have the actual CBD distillate vape cartridge here that comes in its own little container which you can stand up on its own or you could you know some you know some people like to put actually on the battery pen itself its standard 510 threading on this and then you can the container there now vaping CBD is you know is entirely different way of ingesting it then then through your digestive tract for the digestive tract you're only absorbing a certain percentage of the total amount of CBD that's in the product whereas vaping it you're getting and practically entirely all of it and it's going directly in your bloodstream so when you vape CBD you know you're feeling the effects almost immediately so it's great for you know after a sports event and you have aches and pains you can you can vape after that you have a big meeting or a big presentation it's always good to vape a little CBD before those and you know you you get the instant the CBD the benefits of the CVD and this is CBD distillate so it's got a it's got a high viscosity to it it doesn't really move much until it's heated up and when the oil is heated up it turns into a vape vapour basically what else can I tell you now our carts our cartridges are actually really high-tech cartridges they have eight oil holes in the bottom of the cartridge so that all the oil when it when it keeps up and drips down at all get you so no oil ever goes to waste and then we actually have there's there's our top airflow holes on the cartridge at the top and that allows you to pull the air up from the top as opposed to the bottom of the cartridge or the bottom of our cartridges are sealed airtight so there's never any leaks I'll show you let me show you imperative cartridge competitors cartridge so oil they have side holes not like bottom holes like ours and the oil gets stuck in between the side holes and then that they're bought the bottom of their cartridge is not sealed and so you'll you'll get leaks sometimes coming through the bottom of these so back to our cartridge here I know if you have any questions you can always just shoot us an email at support at blue chronic stress calm and let me now show you about let me show you all about the battery so basically to turn on you click it five times five times in a row and then it turns along and then for the lowest setting is 2 point 7 volts it's white and say you're just you know you can hold it down it has a 10 second time timeout so you can hold it down take your puff release it the second setting to advanced settings you click it three times now it goes to the second setting which is three point one volts this is a good medium setting the first setting actually is great cuz you can really taste the terpenes in it once you start getting up to a higher setting you kind of burn off those terpenes or heat off those terpenes and so is it it all depends on your personal preference and then the third setting the highest settings is 3 point 6 volts and it's the color red and you click it three times and it goes to red now this also has a quote this pen actually has a cool feature where if you're let's say you're out outside on a hike and it's really cold out and they'll you know the CBD distillates you know pretty solid you can there's a preheat setting where you click it two times and then it'll go for fifteen seconds it will preheat your oil so if it's cold out it will it will get it going and then when you take your first take your first puff off it will it will help hit nicely and I'm gonna go ahead and take a puffer like I said has a 10 second shot off so you can never really overheat the distillate I hope you enjoyed watching our video today and again as I said if you have any questions please email us at support at blue crown extracts calm thank you", "h8XduReVYPA": "yo guys what's going on welcome back to another kart review um we back in the car I just picked up these cards that's why I'm reviewing them in the car I don't know I didn't want to do it at home so I have two cards here I'm only gonna review one you guys know the deal I've been recommended these a few times by a few different people I've never really gotten I could chance to buy them I haven't seen too many deals on them so I saw one today and I needed some so I was like [ __ ] it so the first one I got well the one that we're not reviewing today is the Select Ely these are the elite lives so like the live resin one this is the Death Star I got this one because you guys know I'm more of an indica or sativa kind of guy at least at the momentum starting to head towards indicas but um yeah this one's got Death Star in the name so how am I not gonna get it right by the way if you see me looking around it's because I'm in an abandoned [ __ ] mall I got these at jars cannabis MetroCenter which is the mole that's closing so it's like ghetto as [ __ ] over here anyway if you live in Phoenix you know what I'm talking about anyway the next one we have that I'm actually gonna review today is the desert lime right so this is a sativa you guys know sativas for me right now we're coming at 80 5.30% for the THC contents in the sativa and the hybrid earthy I'm sorry the indica is coming in at eighty four point eight four percent potency that's the potency I'm sorry the THC presents seventy-nine and then seventy-seven with some decimals anyway all that crap out of the way blah blah blah [ __ ] this we're gonna open it right now and take some hits always open it from the bottom I don't know why I don't you have to I haven't had a live resin cart you know [ __ ] minute guys I've had a select carton just as long cool so here it is you guys know the standard mouthpiece I select comes with it's actually really nice mouthpiece my personal favorite you guys know that I prefer it over this one right here sorry I'm [ __ ] mess so this is the Rove by the way this row of cart guys I love Rove if I see another deal I'll probably end up getting it because it is a very nice car highly recommend even this one feels heavier than the Select cart by the way I was mentioning that in my last video that this is a heavy duty cart it's heavier than the full gram or the half gram that's filled so just for comparison anyway got the half ass charged who's penny here go ahead and pop off this gay-ass cap throw it over there it's on the floor now my been alright I do not have any liquids in my car I was not prepared for this I was not planning to come here but I did so you know I got to live with my consequences here's the [ __ ] wax and you see if I figure out what a camera a little bit darker than some of the other waxes not too much doesn't move you know sorry you guys can see I'm [ __ ] sweating and if you hear background noise like a little whatever that is um it's a hundred and [ __ ] ten degrees out and I'm sitting in my car in my ACS only on two otherwise I tried it three is way too loud so bear with me guys it's gonna get hot I'm gonna [ __ ] die in this car right now doing this video but it's for you guys so yeah let's do another one oh wait another one I'm not even high I'm just stupid Cheers okay I'm gonna be honest with you guys tastes like [ __ ] and it tastes like battery acid I mean see that bubble that's right boy let me try to see through my fingers there see that bubble yeah that was already there before I hit it so I could be hitting out of that pocket but I taste it straight like battery acid and I don't feel anything yet so number two Cheers okay okay so it turns out it's the same [ __ ] taste all right it should dog doo-doo well who not a fan of the taste guys I guess you don't really go for a live resin cards for the taste so before you come at me in the comments I know that [ __ ] alright so if you've already comments it delete that [ __ ] but you know I do actually feel it no the cards would look out more well there's a bubble it's already a nice [ __ ] size bubble tune that's that's nice I guess yeah I like it not bad um to be honest I'd say I like the RO better already but I've only taken two hits so you guys know we do the traditional three here we'll take one more and then I'll judge let's see I have their seat right here I got these two for a deal normally they're like 50 bucks each which is pretty pricey but they are life resin so you guys know [ __ ] but it came out too yeah two of them before tax with 65 bucks with taxes 7059 so you're paying $35 for a half gram Carter essentially and it's not the best in my opinion I would say I'd prefer the Rose because they are cheaper by fourteen dollars I can't say anything against death star yet I'll try that one it's not mine I'm giving it to somebody who has their med card legally right no feds nothing it's all legal I bet um but I'll hit that one I'll let you guys know in the next video I might even review that one I might be able to do that I don't see why I couldn't so if that's the next video you'll see I have another cart already at home that I can review for the next one so it's not going to be too long for another upload because this one should be a couple days after the last one which is nice so yeah let's do one more hit here and then I'm gonna leave and go get some food because I am starving I get Chipotle so if Chipotle's watching the sponsor me too all of that [ __ ] sponsor me Cheers yeah so it doesn't even taste like a dab or anything it just straight tastes like you're hitting an empty heart and that's my problem with this one if you hate that battery acid taste do not get at least do not get a when is this desert lime try another one it's wait no this is a hybrid but I'm so stupid it even says on the box right there I'm gonna pinky that when I ordered it I swear to God I pick sativa I don't pick hybrids oh never mind I'm just even stupider they didn't have any hybrids it was hybrid sativa dominant and then okay I'm sorry guys so yeah this is a sativa hybrid that's the answer thank you John Trebek anyway guys I'm pretty joins I'm not gonna lie so this car for 35 bucks I'd say this car it's worth it there's a guy walking behind me I hope I don't stabbed yeah I'll let you guys judge for this one I'm gonna start raiding carts at us out of 10 yeah we'll do 10 I was gonna say seven for some reason but at its head I'm gonna give this one a 6 yeah it's a 6 for these live resins I'd say Rove since I didn't write it I'd say Rove is probably a 7 point 5 and 8 so you know I'll start writing them now that way you guys can get a judgment if you're interested so yeah this one's up in the air if you guys want to test it out I like you guys have said I've been recommended a few times not the biggest fan but you know glad I tried it any other recommendations let me know yeah other than that guys that's the end of the video I will see you in the next one deuces", "bcvJBXr6bSU": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpatom coming right back with you guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "FD6qyWqFhp4": "oh gee deliveries presents the review of Alpo and live resin 1000 milligram cartridges these cartridges start with a base of pure propylene glycol thus creating a solution ranging from

org", "hdQt-Ej-2Ho": "all right everybody hello and welcome back to another video with tokentim420 this is a florida medical marijuana review for those over the age of 18 and medical marijuana patients all right like say hi to everybody out there if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button down there leave me a thumbs up thumbs down let me know how you're feeling tonight what you're smoking on token on what you're moved in um so today we got the token tim's mad scientist lab we are going to be making some rosin vape carts on our own save a lot of money um i will like give a shout out real quick um i got some of that girl scout cookie now this stuff was only coming in at 15 it was minnie's i couldn't see that online um and i'm not a fan of girl scouts but this stuff totally changed my mind this stuff's real good um nice flavor to it nice high to it not quite a sativity ah as sativa leaning as the last stuff i've had that was the girl scout cookie so like i said not bad at all all right so we're gonna make our own rosin vape carts now you guys know i've tried true leaves i just went and got another one we got the skunk ape blue river rosin we tried both of them for cure leaf i left the other box in there from the select um some people was asking if this was live resin or not to me it didn't really taste like that tastes more like the terpene like the cannabis infused terpene vape pens exactly like them so if you could find those vape pens cheaper i'd go with them but we're going to show you a way to do it real cheap and i tell you what they taste amazing all right so we squirted a little distillate in there i got i was trying some of them i got a little tore up had to take a break my water cooled off so it didn't work so this is take two on the video honestly um that's that papaya cake rosin from move or from true leave sorry um in there and then the distillate we're using because it's an indica uh the indica uh bubba kush coming at 78 percent so all i did was microwave some water and a shot glass put it in there you don't want to get it up past the stopper there you don't want to get back in there i want to get this part done before it cools off again so there was probably about three left in here on this syringe it's got a little bubble but it was about at three i put a little bit in there already so when it's warmed up it's just gonna go real easy in there yeah i guess we're gonna use all of it all right that's all of it are all that we're gonna mess with getting out at the moment now if you notice the pad i'm using is that five dollar baking sheet which is silicone so it's the same thing as a dab mat that i got on amazon it was like five bucks or two for five i can't remember videos if you go back as while back i just cut a piece off to fit the table so i didn't have to clean the whole table off so now all we're going to do is we're going to take this and we're going to mix it up now i have made a few of these before i did warm the rosin up on the one and then by time i got out here it was just kind of like a hardened back up more like a caramel just letting it sit out at room temperature seems to work better let me pull it off the view for a second and make sure i got it mixed evenly sometimes the distillate wants to stay on the side but as you know the rosin carts are about 60 bucks apiece and they're only half grams so this distillate i believe was 60 bucks from grow healthy which truly has them for 60 most everybody's around the 60 mark for a full gram so this right here will fill two vape carts um and then the rosin's uh 75 gram so you basically for 135 you're getting two grams um which you would only get one gram buying it by the vape cards like i said these are half gram vape carbs these aren't full grams only half grams if you also notice on true leaves the thc is always really low i'm using 80 distillate and 80 um rosin so these are still up in the 80 percent so we're gonna use our um we had some la confidential co2 cart which i got another one of these so we will be reviewing it later then all we're going to do is unscrew the top here now i will say that it helps to have a decent dab tool the dab tool i'm using is the one i got for five dollars uh from banger supply and if you use code token tim you'll save 10 at banger supply they got these for like 5.99 so try to keep it up here in the camera see what we can do so mainly what we're going to do is we're going to take the flatter end um or either end the flatter end kind of works better towards the end and we're just going to get a glob out there like that this stuff's stringy and looking in the camera is a pain in the butt all right we'll hold that there and then what i do is just press it around the stem and then put it down in there so let me go over here and do this where you guys can still see it but yeah you guys can see it there now i'm gonna go ahead and use the flat end just kind of scoop out a big scoop like that and then smooth on that thing and it's easier just to push it right down in there you guys can see that just kind of pushing it down now it doesn't go real good um so there is a trick we'll use here in a second once we get it pretty blobbed up all right trying to it's hard for me to focus i need new glasses so i keep pulling it off the frame to me to be able to see it now i'm just scraping all the gunk out of the jar real good i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna go over to a clear spot each time and just wipe it off on that and then take the tool focus there we go and slide it down that thing it's not wanting to focus if it does go on the outside just scoop it back up all right we've got about all of it now the first one i tried to wait for it to go down and it just didn't seem to go down quick enough so i'm gonna take a little torch and i'm gonna heat the glass down in here i'm not gonna heat the concentrate i'm just gonna do it like that without burning my fingers off hopefully so i'm just going to slightly warm the glass going around you can see it's starting to drip there where we warmed it up so just real quick that one bubbled on me and then it starts to it'll just start to run down in there then go ahead and take the tool and access there's a little bubble there we're going to pop that scrape all that off on there try not to get it inside there for sure we've already got it about half full it doesn't take a lot um a lot of concentrate that is you can see i only had about three in that syringe and i only put a couple dabs in there it really wasn't a lot so again we're going to take a little bit sometimes with this i can just scrape it right across the glass or like i said just roll it around that and whatever's left there the mouthpiece fits real tight over that silicone ring and it just pushes everything else down let's get a real good scrape on this jar real quick and then i'll show you the other ones i made and talk about them a little bit now i will say the flavor on this stuff is just amazing it tastes just like just like doing the dab let's scrape this off of there real quick all right now i could play around and get some more out there but i want with you guys i'll just dab that out with my dab straw later so we're going to stick that on see how it just squishes that on through there and we're going to screw that on now i found with some of them you'll have to go back again with your torch and this one's a little thicker you can see it's still thick so i'm just barely going to heat it if it starts to bubble you want to quit so i have to look at this real good and it'll take a second for the heat to transfer through to the glass still a little creamy there's still some up there at the top there we go this one must be a little thicker glass than the other one i had we're just going to hit it a few times now if you notice when we did that it kind of cleared up a little bit not a lot but so you can see the little holes down in there now where the wick is you'll see how that cleared it up some and i didn't bring the battery out i told you i got pretty medicated all right but we have made a few other ones um so i made one yeah this is it i used the move vape pen and this it worked great for about two days and the battery died and if you can see right here at the bottom it's got little um holes i thought i could take it off with a battery i grabbed it with some pliers and apparently i couldn't so i shattered it what i'm going to do is unscrew the lid i'm not going to do it now because i want the glass to fall off and then i'm going to heat the banger up and i'm going to put it in there upside down like that and just let all that wax come out now this was the um i used the skunk ape and the bubba kush um the skunk ache ape was from move or true leave again sorry i don't know i got move on the head now i did put some of the thca powder in that one also and it was really really really tasty tasted just like the skunk ape tastes a lot better than the skunk ape rosin car which we'll get we'll have a video on that later but like i said really really really tasty um and the thc is going to be up there and it's a cheaper cheaper thing so i'll show you the other one i did but first we got to do it sorry it's alive all right so i did make a live resin vape cart um this is with moves rainbow train wreck and you can see how it's cleared up a little bit more i hit it with a little bit more of the torch um but it tastes amazing there's a little clog there that's why heated this one up it was clogging a little bit but man it tastes amazing and the high on there i'm telling you the high is better than any of these vape pens i've had yet and i gotta write what i put on this one so i don't forget that's the rainbow train wreck which we know it's live rosin because that's all there is um but the skunk ape one i'm telling you you know vape card even these i hit these um you know 10 good hits off of them to catch a little buzz um i was only hitting that skunk ape three three little hits and i was blasted i the dying i made that i rolled up a joint um and after my three hits i had like this much left of the joint and i looked at that i'm like hey no way i'm lighting that thing back up so it tore me up pretty good so if you guys want to give it a try like it's not really messy you do have a little bit of residue left in these so you could either take a bud and roll it around in there and then roll in some keep and make your own moon rock or you could just take your dab straw and hit it you could also take a hair dryer and melt it down so it would get it in a corner better to get a little better dab out of it but if i mess around with it with like this one that has that little scoop on the end i can pretty much get everything out of that jar there won't be anything left and especially it's starting to cool off now because it's getting ready to rain here but especially when i'm working in a hot garage and it pretty much stays warm here anyways it makes it easier to work with it's not coming back up so it's easier like i said just to push push it all the way around to the corners i just take this one the longer straighter one and get the sides like that and what i'll do with this is dab it that's what i do with the other stuff that's why i mark the charge but i think it rub keeps rubbing off with my fingers so that one's uh we just made the papaya cake so that was this one we're just gonna put a pea on the jar so i remember but yeah that's what i'll just use when i come out tonight i'll scrape that again you can see like i said i just got that little bit i wiped off on the edge there just by taking it around a little bit and just keep scraping it back on the side and then when you get enough to take a dab you just take it all off of there and dab away and like i said with the other with the rounded one it works a little better getting everything out there real good this one's not bad but the other one's better so like i said it doesn't take long to get you a dab and then just drop the dab tool in the dab rig and you're good so that's my take on making my own vape cards um the live resin i did use the co2 true clear the sherbert so i figured it'd have a nice cleaner flavor but this stuff here wasn't bad um i haven't tried this one i just made yet of course i didn't bring the battery out um but i used it with a skunk 8 but that skunk cape's got such a strong skunky um smell to it it's hard to for anything else to come through so we'll see if anything comes through on this one but like i said the thca powder worked great in there too it didn't clog that one up that one worked you know it was almost all the way full and you can tell see there's not much left in there i smoked over half of it in a couple days it was so tasty and like i said the battery just quit on me so i don't recommend refilling those the reason i refilled this one and like i said we got it filled with just that little bit i didn't use a lot i'll show you how much i used on that um but this one's got the charging port on the bottom so hopefully we can recharge it when it does die now i only use this was a full gram i did lick a little bit and but pretty much i just used two i pushed it from where it was at the one to maybe just past the eight so maybe three milliliters of this stuff but closer to probably the two because it did fill that pin up and it's only 300 milligrams so like i said it didn't take much of this to fill that vape in and i did dab a little bit in my mouth dabbed a little bit in the banger just to try it the flavor wasn't bad the banger wasn't real clean so i couldn't get a good flavor on it so we'll save that for a review hopefully too well that's going to be it guys if you have any questions just leave them down there in the comments like i said this is an easy way you could also just put the distillate straight into the vape pen without the rosin and just make a bait pin that's what pretty much they're using is distillate but like i said with just a little bit of that rosin it makes it a real good flavor so you don't need a lot of that even you could probably just put maybe two little dabs in there mix it around put one in there see how you like it next time add more if you need to but like i said they tore me up good so i definitely recommend those of you who are feeling your own give this a shot let me know what you think of it that's going to be it guys we do got some more videos coming tomorrow we got a delivery coming and then we'll also do what's new in the florida mmj we got some new things coming yeah so make sure you tune in tomorrow for that one uh make sure you

going so thanks for being here in my bedroom and i'm going to do another dmt trip so i said i was going to go for a big one so i think i'm just going to go for a big one and i also said i'd do my next one in the park but i don't think i want to go for a huge trip in that park so i'll do the big trip here now in my bedroom and then i'll do like a milder trip out there in the coming weeks i got some music playing but i'm gonna you know cancel it out of my video it's um carbon based life forms i don't know if you've ever listened to them but they play pretty mellow electronic music and i got the lights fairly dim as you can see and i got this really nice video for visuals that i put up on my screen in case i end up leaving my eyes open which sometimes i do and i will link that in the description if you want to check out what i was watching and i'll link the carbon based life forms album 2 which i'm listening to anyways i'll be using a dmt cartridge which don't ask me how i got it or where to get them guys i've been getting that that question a lot in the comments i don't want that stuff in my comments or not you guys i mean new viewers probably if you're new to the channel that's just keep that in mind just you know do your own research where there's a will there's a way get get resourceful i had a friend who who had the cartridges so i got lucky with that i don't really know where he got them all right so i'm not really like in a very talky make a video mood but i wanted to document my trip so uh if you don't mind i'm just gonna get to it and then if i feel like speaking about it later i will speak about it later but maybe i'll just do that tomorrow or something i just wanted to film the actual trip itself because i just wanted to trip tonight you know you get it you know what i'm trying to say so so we'll see or i might end up talking afterwards i don't know sometimes i have a trip and it's just so like intense i just sort of feel like waiting a bit like i said in my last video i lost the mouthpiece the tip just the tip i lost and um so i have to like make sure my lips go around it you know so that's why i'm hitting it funny if it looks like i'm hitting it funny and i'm gonna lie down i prefer to lie down usually sometimes i sit up but usually i'm like taking a hit or something and i got to deal with that so it's nice to have the pen i can just lie down and put it in here after i that's why i got this because because the tip is missing it will leak out if i hold it upside down so i gotta like keep it upright that's not quite small enough actually i'll put this cloth in here there we go genius such a genius okay guys thanks for watching the video i do lots of videos like this so check out my channel for more trip reports and stuff like that and um there's music and there's just you know okay boys and girls i bid you farewell is that that's that is that what they say it's an old english thing right i bid the i bid the farewell okay i think that's about it i'm ready i'm tired i find dmt is good if you're like tired and getting ready for bed if you're relaxed skip you're in a relaxed mood for sure i'm stalling i'm stalling [Applause] here we go [Music] uh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] so [Music] sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh my god you guys oh my god [Music] oh [Music] oh my god [Music] it was pointing at me it told me oh my god you guys [Music] the coordinates tracking my like eye movement i'm just saying this so i don't forget later sorry if it doesn't make sense the coordinates it's pointing out to me what the fuck it's trying to decide whether or not to close my eyes it's always something i struggle with and when i was doing that it felt like the trip was getting mad at me and then when i just and then i decided to leave them open and i think i was telling it was telling me like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like nothing you say or do matters really it's in control always and my god the further i get away from it the less ability i have to describe what i just saw fuck still really high i wasn't blacking out at any point but like i still can't it's like it's trying to make me forget like i saw how the universe worked there's some being that can just do whatever it wants whenever it wants it can move wherever it wants and just you know i saw different reality different universes multiverses and just oh my god maybe the details will come like what the fuck i kept saying too like i should talk about this because i'm gonna i'm gonna forget later but i'm like no no i'll remember i'll remember it all makes sense and then just every minute that goes by makes it's less and less sense but i just saw what the fuck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] watch i wasn't recording this whole time i'm still recording thank god well that was cool i just saw the universe work to you guys and it looked like it was like okay hear me out it's not gonna make much sense but this is the best i can describe it like every universe was on like a string and it was like sort of moving they were sort of moving towards me like they're all connected but when i was trying to decide whether to open or close my eyes this like entity came it was invisible an invisible entity but i could sense it was there and where it was it suddenly moved like through the realities and was getting mad at me it's like it came from wherever it was all the way here to tell me that sorry let me just mute my music i came from wherever just just to tell me like just to tell me where was i holy fuck this is so hard to talk about i came oh yeah i came from wherever was just to tell me it doesn't matter like when my eyes are open or closed like stop thinking about all that stupid shit and i didn't see any entities as usual i don't see entities sometimes i do they're usually robots but uh this time it wasn't except that that that entity i guess you would call it but it was like invisible and then also when it was telling me not to um it doesn't matter if your eyes are open and closed it wasn't telling it to me it was telling it to something else i don't know what that was and i was just like obser observing that that that message what was it talking to like maybe my brain and i the observer like the soul i guess you can refer to it as or whatever was the one observing that you know which sort of like lends to the idea like the separation of body and soul you know like two separate things like you and your life aren't the same thing look at this pose i'm sitting in this very i don't know it feels right though okay i'm not a two-year-old sit like a man oh where did this come from was i holding this the whole time i don't know i don't know i just don't know um the visuals are very cool like yeah i realize now definitively i know now it doesn't matter if your eyes are open or closed people always have that debate if you smoke enough um like maybe it will vary the experience but it not the intensity of it or how good it is necessarily you know like if you smoke enough if your eyes are open it'll take whatever you're looking at and transform that into whatever so like i was looking at you know my room became all multiple universes like on a thread like reeling past me and then this fucking being darting around it was like this that was like the master i don't want to say god because it wasn't that it didn't seem benevolent either it didn't seem evil but it just it seemed like it was getting shit done it was busy and it didn't it seemed a little angry that it had to be there to tell me like deal with this trivial shit like it had better things to do i got the sense and it's like you know tell this idiot whoever it was talking to he doesn't need to or he wasn't he didn't call me an idiot but i got the sense that he was frustrated like short he she whatever it and um it was like yeah tell tell him it doesn't matter you know or it wasn't even saying tell him it was just talking to him it was like it doesn't matter and i was just like observing it and i didn't hear those words it was just i got the sense that's what uh it was trying to communicate to my body or whatever it was talking to um the visuals like afterwards and then before that seems like a short trip also i start talking like while i'm still tripping and i think that's what sort of takes me out of it because i'm like aware i wasn't for a second or two but i'm aware that i'm recording and doing a chirp report so i start like i start talking sitting up while like most people still probably have their eyes closed i don't know or maybe it wasn't short maybe just uh that's my perception of it that was fucking intense though it's funny the visuals i had on my screen oh yeah another thing too the audio went it muted itself i'm gonna have to check uh the playback and see like if my actual audio muted because i have music playing i'm just i'm gonna cut out the parts when i'm not talking um i'm going to check if it actually muted because that was weird because at one point i was hearing the music and it just cut out completely it was silent for a few seconds which is a weird hallucination like canceling out your sound that's pretty like intense like it has some like pretty high permissions in your brain to be able to like access that that sort of shit like mute all sounds you know that's like administrator privileges you know like you can't just mute the fucking sound in my brain like what are you doing it's crazy it did though and then well oh yeah when i was closing and opening my eyes i don't know if i was or not but i think if you if you look in the video they'll show a part where i'm like sort of like opening and closing them i was like going back and forth at least my memory tells me that's what i did during that part like all the effects were like flickering on and off like i mentioned in my when did i mention that i think it was in my live stream i don't know but i was talking about how sometimes the effects they just flicker on and off like an rgb cable being wiggled in the back of an old computer you'd see the colors just flicker instantly right and what was oh yeah that was happening when it's opening closing the eyes with everything all the effects it's just like very computer simulated like themes of simulation here but not not totally this time that that entity seemed beyond beyond like a computer simulation you know uh it's weird too when that's happening it's like oh my god i have the answer this is crazy but so that's like a delusional thought obviously but i'm still there i'm still conscious because i remember thinking like wait till i tell my subscribers i got to see her to the universe like this is going to make a banger video you know meaning of life and i'm at for a good 30 seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds i thought that i'm like i know i know everything i know the answer and uh i can't wait this can make a great video isn't that funny and then slowly it starts you start realizing like wait a second that can't be true and i know it's not true because every trip is like different like last trip like something else was the answer now the answer is this you know there's several meanings to life apparently but this i've never had a trip where i imagined something that it's like beyond like something i couldn't come up with myself you know so i'm not convinced that dmt is um anything supernatural just yet but i don't find it any less poetic or beautiful or spiritual or anything like that you know it's just to me it's a testament to how complex the human brain is and how incredible nature is you know in life itself life is the trip as i say dmt is just like i made this analogy to someone earlier in the comments life okay dmt is like a program and life is like the operating system you know what i mean like psychedelic trips are just a small thing that happens within life oh my shit's about to shut off i think or no i just split the recording so part of it might just cut out so i'm just gonna repeat what i just said i forget what i just said fuck am i scratching my nuts geez okay ignore the last 10 seconds i'm probably going to keep it in for comedic effect but ignore it that was a really cool trip that every trip has a different vibe to it there's like a few main categories each one is unique but there's some broader categories too like some of them are funny some of them are very spiritual and uplifting like my two live trips one and two those ones were very spiritual and uplifting and afterwards i felt like at peace with the world i don't really have that this time although i do feel good but um i this one was more like the ones based in outer space always have the same vibe to them and those ones are all about like how the universe works and god and stuff like that and higher powers and those ones are fascinating not necessarily positive or overwhelmingly positive or scary just it feels like it's showing me the truth so it's it's not trying to be anything it's just the truth right and it's those ones are like awesome not like awesome like you know like awesome dude like it's full of awe you know awe inspiring like mind mind-blowing and just i don't know i'm going to have to look back at the tape but i'm pretty sure i was just like oh really good like five minutes not that long three or four minutes maybe i don't know it's funny i'm like the visuals on my screen ended up being like the least interesting thing ever i'm like looking at universes suddenly i'm going to watch i want to watch this youtube visual oh i've had youtube visuals turn into amazing things before so that's why i throw them on sometimes thing barely went down too how many hits that i i tried to take more hits but i couldn't feel the pen anymore it felt like it was over here and my jaw was like disconnecting and like it was like numb and shit you know when you don't know like where the pen is or how to hit it or and this thing's easy to hit when you you can't feel it you know that's when you're good to go this is a pretty strong pen or the liquid i think both um seems to work really well compared to most anecdotes i've heard about the efficacy of these pens a lot of people say it's really hard for them to get like a breakthrough dose that was like borderline breakthrough so that was like a low-level breakthrough dose i would say i don't like the term breakthrough but for those of you who go by that system i would say this is like a barely breakthrough barely i broke through barely it wasn't like uh as intense as some breakthrough trips i've had and it doesn't definitely wasn't sub breakthrough i was yeah i was out of here and when that fucking entity started beaming around i felt so powerless like i felt like oh fuck like this thing is boss whatever you i couldn't see it i just sense where it was it was invisible i'm wheezy okay that was great guys i think i'm gonna play some video games smoke a big bowl of marijuana and um maybe have it no no i gotta quit drinking fuck for real for real i gotta quit drinking i gotta stop masturbating snow not november is not going well guys what is it it's fucking february i think i need another extension i failed again i failed every day every day i failed no not november in february so the ninth extension this thing is dope as fuck i hate smoking empty even if you're doing bong hits which is like the easiest way to smoke tmt it's still kind of like a bit of a process to get the lighter to pull the ball out you know just it's it's hard on your second or third hit to do that this thing's fucking easy though i took double poles like someone suggested to me in the comments whoever what that was thank you good idea because this thing cuts out after five seconds so but if you just stop and then start again it resets the timer so um i could take two hits in one that that way essentially that fucking second hit i took or was it the third i don't know that was a huge fucking hit and i held those in for a long time you guys i have a pretty big lung capacity so i think it's easy easier for me than most people to get the dose in you know like i imagine for someone who doesn't smoke weed every day um it would be much harder much much harder to take hits like that because dmt is pretty harsh it's harshly different way it doesn't burn because it's vaporized but it's it's it's spikier you know it's got a i don't know if you know what i mean by that but it spikes your lungs more than weed weed is like it's hot obviously because you burn it and it can burn if you take a big hit but i don't know vapor has like it's like the initial feeling when you you take it in is harsher for the empty for sure but then once it's in there then it's fine work weeds the other way around it kind of burns more and more the more you hold it in uh no nausea at all which is good okay guys i'm sorry if the camera just uh changed angles and it was jarring i apologize but i finished the vlog then i went and got a hot dog which i would which i can't wait to eat but but a couple more details came to me and i will forgo eating this hot dog i'm not foregoing it i'm putting it off i will eat this hot dog but a couple details came to me while i was in the kitchen that i forgot to talk about so during the trip i talked about i think i mentioned i blurted out like eye coordinates or something like that that was supposed to be a reminder for me to talk about it later because i couldn't explain it at the time but i knew i'd be able to later i want this offering so bad this happened to me in at least 10 trips before and in a couple of my last ones i keep forgetting to mention it though but at the very beginning when i'm coming up and i'm looking around i'll see numbers in the corner two numbers and i'll see like a crosshair in my vision like tracking my eye movement and it moves wherever i move my eye and the numbers change depending where i'm looking like they're coordinates tracking my eye movement like an x and a y coordinate it's very weird another thing too is in the trips where like it's the universe being revealed to me how it works in those trips like in outer space at the very beginning often it's like you've been chosen we're selecting you it doesn't say that but i it's like i hear i sense what they're trying to say without hearing the audio so it would be like you know you're chosen like you're special basically we're showing you how the universe works and you're going to be the messiah you're going to be the one to like tell everyone about this and i i get that sense and i've gotten that sense in several trips probably at least five before where it's like you've been chosen almost like a lottery like uh out of like trillions infinite number of souls they chose me to like give me the secrets and then i'm gonna go and tell everybody apparently that's how it works and that's weird that i get that but i've gotten that yeah several times i just wanted to mention that okay back to the video or maybe the video is ending now i don't know where i'm going to insert this clip so maybe bye i love you guys or maybe back to the show i don't know i'm leaving my options open it's hot talk time i deserve this hot dog pro tip pro tip if you're microwaving a hot dog throw the bun in there for a good 10 seconds the water molecule something happens to them in the bun in it it gets soft and like reinvigorates the bun especially if they were in the fridge microwaved that bun i had a couple drinks too and um smoked some weed not like pretty much right before the trip i broke the rules guys i broke the rules that pro pretty much is a rule though i would say if you do if you don't have a tolerance to weed or alcohol oh that's black that's black that's not a good color no weed you're smoking weed yet um i guess it's essentially resin building up in your in your in your in your phlegm i'm gonna say it no one likes that word but it it is it's phlegm you guys that's fine though doesn't mean anything bad it's just black you know black doesn't necessarily mean death you guys doesn't mean it's bad doesn't mean it's evil you know it's just but it's black there's a little blackness okay okay you know guys i've been feeling good in the last few months relatively speaking and [Music] i pretty i pretty much attribute that

time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more ways for anti counterfeiting is on its way like share subscribe for more videos like this and as always stay safe do research and never babe underage peace", "4k0qumqCKYQ": "hey guys it's Jason from best friend this is a demonstration video of the best one guys cartridge fill the gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "KslGabh50gI": "what's up guys welcome back i realized i really never actually introduced myself maybe a few times but my name is alina for those of you who don't know today i'm going to show you guys how you can eat the oil in your carts or how you can use it in edibles i'm going to show you guys how to make butter infused butter with your carts it's very easy once you get the distillate out of the carts you can use it in many different ways such as just plain straight up eating it adding it to butter you can also use it in quite a few different recipes i do have a few on my channel that i think it would go very well with such as adding it to oreos or to dummies um i'll post the links of some suggested edible videos for you guys to make below and check those out you can use the oil in most of the carts at least the ones that are distilled which if you're getting them from dispensary that's what they should be if they're ordered online it's hard for us to really know um i tried one of or some of the oil from one of mine that i ordered online and i'll show you guys the clip here of me um trying it and it really worked just straight up eating it even just a little bit of it i'm also going to show you guys in this video how to add oil to butter so you guys can have infused butter that way and in this case you guys don't need to decarb or anything like that because the thc is already activated when i show you guys how to make the butter with the oils in the cart you could also do the same thing with purchase the salad so in any recipe where it calls for half a cup of infused butter a quarter cup of whatever amount of infused butter if you don't have that infused butter that was made the traditional method you could also just add distillate to butter which is what i'm going to show you guys how to do in this video so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass today i will be showing you how to use carts and edibles or how to um just straight up eat them slash what happens when so um i have a bunch of miscellaneous cards i have um some that i ordered online a long time ago um and then i have some that are from dispensaries um and i don't really want to vape the ones that i got online i just don't know if i really trust them anymore i even have like um a whole full one that i'm probably just gonna eat somehow um but yeah so what i wasn't sure about is they should all be distilled and they definitely will be um the ones i'm getting from the dispensary i definitely know are with one's online i'm not so sure um but it's like a 95 chance that the cards that you have are just phillip um but that's what this method i'm going to show you guys is for and if it's a different type i don't um i can't confirm that it would work the same one thing i wanted to try is if i would eat some of the liquid what would happen um and i did that a few days ago i recorded it and i'll put that in here and i'll show you guys exactly what happens okay so i have one of my cards here which is mostly empty and i'm going to um consume it i don't know how much i'll see how much i can get out um and we're going to see if this is going to do anything because i don't know if i need to heat them up first for them to work or if they're just gonna um work on their own so instead of trying to just figure it out because like i said i bought these online and i don't actually know how legit they are um so we're just gonna try it and we're gonna we're gonna see if that works i'm going to i couldn't unscrew this by hand so i'm just using um a rubber glove for a little bit of grip or this isn't rubber i don't know what this is called but and then um these for some more grip and that comes off pretty easy i think yeah so there's that [Music] i guess i should turn this right here [Music] um i'm just trying to see if i can pull this thing out okay i think what i should do is put this in some i'm gonna put this in a cup of hot water first so that the uh liquid will warm up and kind of i'm just gonna place it like um this direction so when i take it off the liquid will be down here okay so i have a i just have a shot glass that i put um i filled with hot water from the top and i'm gonna place this in here um like this so that um the water will heat it up and it'll drop to the bottom where i need to access it from so i'm just popping that in there and i just made sure that there was enough water to actually cover um all the way up to here so i had to fill it up pretty high and then i figured this was probably going to cool off pretty fast so i got another bowl of just some water that i put in the microwave for about 30 seconds and i'm gonna place this into the bowl to kind of like just keep the water warm and i'm just gonna check on it every so often and then um put warmer water in there although it's already dropping down so we might not even need to change that so yeah i'm just gonna leave this here for a few minutes okay so i had to warm up the water once through this whole thing it took about like 20 minutes for it to um melt so there it is there's still a little bit there but i'll just dig it out okay so i'm just gonna dry this off there we go and then coming undone there okay so i'm just gonna use this toothpick to to get it out i'm just gonna straight up like eat it [Music] it doesn't taste bad it doesn't really taste like anything i hope this works so yeah i'm just scraping it out with a toothpick it's a little bitter and then i'm going to take a lecithin pill and i usually just take these when i take edibles just because it helps a little bit so this is how much is left in here and i'm gonna get the rest of that out which i got almost like i consumed almost all of it but the little bits they're sticking to the side i'm gonna get out when i um get the rest of all of my cartridges like when i do the whole thing which is this what this video is for um but yeah so it is 3 13 so 3 o'clock and i will report back and see if this works or if it does absolutely nothing and i'm really hoping that it works because it's gonna be so much simpler to utilize these carts um if i don't have to deal with heating them up and making sure that all goes smoothly but yeah so i'll be back in a few hours so it's been it's five o'clock so i don't know two hours oh my it worked for sure um i think it's just you know when you take some edibles and you're like oh they're not working i should take some more and then you take more and then you're like oh my god i shouldn't have taken more that's how i feel right now my mouth is so dry so dry and some juice um sorry yeah it definitely worked and i don't know how much stronger and how much more it's gonna kick in like for how long for but i can't even think straight but um this is like really good because and i didn't smoke any weed today at all the only thing i consumed along those lines was that um little cart thing so because i wanted to be sure about it like i was tempted to still hit the pen but i was like i want to be sure that if i feel something i know it's from the pen but yeah okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna reflect back more on this when i'm in another in a better state in the video part next okay okay bye oh gosh i'm so chill very very guys this hits hard okay i feel like i could have taken less you know just be careful with how much you take i think it's a very good amount that i took i think hopefully it's snowing outside also which is insane [Music] october and freezing too so yeah as we see clearly it worked very well i actually was licking some earlier and i shouldn't have because i have to make sure what i'm doing is correct and even just a little bit of it like works very well and i find i have a pretty high tolerance for edible so i was surprised how little of it it took for it to have a strong effect i'm gonna try this one that was broken i'm just gonna like lick whatever is left off of there so i was just playing around with my cartridges to see how to open each one and i was going to open this one and when i was using the pliers to turn it it wasn't i'm turning up here so i decided to put um this onto the glass part in turn and even just a little bit of pressure and it completely shattered so just an fyi when you guys are trying to figure out how to open your carts don't put your pliers directly on the glass i know it's common sense but i still did it so just fyi i don't know if we'll be able to salvage any of this i'll see what i can do but i don't really wanna end up putting a lot of glass in my mouth okay so with the broken one it's not really there's so much glass on it so i don't really know how else to use it so i'm gonna try adding it to this pipe that already has like some stuff in there it's mostly burnt um i'm gonna try and melt this into here and i don't care if there's a little bit of glass in there um because that's fine i'll just throw it out after um so let's see if this works i'm just gonna use a blow dryer to melt this off of here okay so with just using um a little bit of the blow dryer already started to kind of melt off so i'm gonna just yeah see it's a little sticky just try and like push that off into there so there's the glass in there and it was honestly very difficult to get the rest of the oil out of the cart so i kind of think you just kind of have to go with whatever chunks of broken cart you have and just kind of throw them in there so when i light this i'm just going to light it pretty much just like on the like around the glass like on the other side of it just kind of heat it up and then yeah i'm just going to hit that this looks sketchy as heck oh i got quite a bit out of that okay so let's just take a look at it after it's been smoked yeah it all came off pretty well with just a couple hits so your first step is to figure out um where your wear slash how your cards open so for a lot of them i find um you can twist them off by hand at least the ones i ordered online i find if you have um some grip just this glove here yeah now i can't open it once the camera's on okay there we go so yes that comes out um so just figure out where your cards open i assume they should all be on the top but i can't guarantee you want to put the cart so that wherever they open which for me is the tops of them um is on the bottom so that when all the liquid melts down when we open it it'll be easy to access okay so i just had a bowl of um hot water here and then a shot glass michael jackson and i'm gonna fill up that um shot glass with that hot water and then put it in the bowl with hot water to keep it nice and warm now i'm gonna take my cards and place them um with the tip up so that the distillate will fall to the tip which is where i want it to go and i'm actually just going to pour out enough water so that the um water isn't going into the the uh the part that gets screwed in but just enough to keep most of the distillate warm so it can melt properly and then we're just going to wait for this and as it cools down i'll just reheat it or add um more hot water until all of the liquid in the carts fall down which i think will take about 10 minutes ish okay so the water that i used was not warm enough so you want to make sure this water is really hot almost boiling but not boiling um and then it should take about 10 minutes so there's a couple ways you can consume these and the first would be just straight up eating it so let's start with this cartridge here i'm just gonna dry that off and then i'm gonna twist it open [Music] okay so there is our oil i'm just gonna lick this right off here and because it's really warm it came off really easily super easy to get off and then for the rest of this i'm just gonna take a toothpick and do that and then i'm just going to eat it right off the toothpick and then repeat those steps until i have ate all of this little bit of oil in here it doesn't taste the best it's not gonna lie i find that um oops the um the ones from the dispensaries taste a little better than the ones that i ordered online okay so i got pretty much everything i can get out of this one you can either throw this away or you can refill it with some more distillate and another way to eat it is similar to just eating it but if you kind of want to avoid the taste and are looking for something easy i suggest using oreos now yes these are oreo minis but you could use whatever oreos you like this is just what i had at home so i'm gonna get another cartridge here let's pull up this one isn't that beautiful that's one nice thing about getting your carts from the dispensary they're just much nicer looking much nicer looking and this one here is my favorite it's called spinach and the top part that you uh the mouthpiece it actually moves around let's see if you guys can see that see so yeah most of them don't do that so i really like that okay now we're going to open this one and i need to dry that off again too this one is a lot harder to open and while i'm doing this i'm just tasting the one that i had in my mouth and honestly it leaves a pretty gross taste i don't really love that but if you eat something else that's thick it'll probably um disguise it oh my goodness i could not get this open this is going to be an issue i have a feeling because these are from dispensaries it might be what the heck am i tightening it the wrong way so i really cannot get this one open i don't know what it is so i'm just gonna set it back and i think i'm just gonna break into it um to get the rest of the distillate out but for these oreos i'm gonna use this one to show you guys so it seems like the ones from like i said the ones from the um when you order them online or off the block market or whatever these are very easy to unscrew um but the ones from dispensaries not as much kind of makes sense because they're probably trying to avoid you from using them over again so yeah i'm just again gonna um look whatever's left off here tastes horrible i mean it's not that bad i'm being so dramatic okay and then i'm going to um use the toothpick i just have a fresh toothpick here to get the rest of this out okay so i'll just take that um right out of there and i'm gonna put it right into the middle of my little oreo and close that and then that is good to eat and i'll do the same with the other oreo here and you can put as much or as little as you want oh look at that one right here this one is made to put a whole bunch in there and guys i'm not serving these to people so don't don't be saying how nasty this this looks or is because i'm just eating it myself and then the cooler this gets the harder it's going to be get um to get out so work fast um or just put the screw the lid back on and put it back in some hot water but yeah we got most of that out okay so there's one way to do that and then the other is if you want to um use your carts in anything um that would usually require a infused butter or oil you can do that with this so here i have some melted butter this is just regular butter and then i melted it um and then i'm going to directly add my carts right into here and mix all together i'm also going to add some lecithin in here which is going to help bind the butter to the distillate as well as help our bodies absorb the thc i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own and the specific amount doesn't really matter i probably put more than i needed in there but oh well so we're going to add in our carts and all we're going to do is just scrape them into here and mix it really well and then you can use this butter in any recipe that calls for infused butter so the ratios doesn't really matter if you want to put 10 carts in here go put 10 cards if you want to do one cart just do one cart and then say you wanted to make brownies and your brownies call for half a cup of infused butter you can use half a cup of your infused butter so this is really it essentially is the same thing as if you were to add the cart directly to a um say like a batch of brownies but the thing is it would be very hard to distribute that little bit of distillate throughout the whole brownie so by putting it into the butter we're able to get the butter to go throughout all of the brownies instead of just working with you know this much liquid we're working with this much or more so now let's add these ones and so because there's such little left in these in order for me to show you guys how i would actually do this slash how you guys should do this i'm gonna um use this full cart that i haven't used yet and like i said i don't want to use the one i don't want to um inhale the ones that i had ordered online back before so this is a good way to use it so i just heated up a cup of water in the microwave it's almost boiling but not and this came in a package i'm just going to put it right in there and let it actually i'm going to turn it around so that we have the bottom going in first so we can melt this liquid a little bit more so it'll be easier to pour into our butter so i'm going to leave that in there um for a few minutes i just got a comment and say be careful because i've been licking these and like the toothpick and stuff and it gets hitting me hard and i don't know i know i should stop but for the video you know i just want to taste like icings i think i got some oreo icing in it but be careful with how much you use okay this has been been in here for about like five minutes so it should be oh my god it's so hot okay so it should be good if you don't have it doesn't come in one of these bags which i know most don't just put it in a little plastic baggie to be honest it's probably fine to go in without anything but i mean why not use a bag isn't this packaging super cute i love these ones but i don't know i feel weird about using the ones online so i'm just going to open that because i gotta dry it off again there's our brand new cart and i'm gonna open um this part right here and then we're gonna pour all this liquid into our butter that's been melted so this should come out pretty easily because um it was in the hot water melting yeah you can see we got most of that out already okay and then whatever is left which there isn't much um i guess we'll just use a toothpick to get that out but you could use a blow dryer too to kind of push it down but yeah that came out really easy and it was only in the hot water for um like three or four minutes and you know i really don't like the taste of the back of all this like in the back of my throat like as i'm doing this because i've been eating like eating a little bits throughout and it just does not taste good so i really think it'd be nicer with the oreos and stuff so that you can kind of have something i don't know so it doesn't have to like line your mouth and throat it can just go right into your stomach and see now i have um it's all over this and i can't get that into the butter so i'm just gonna have to like suck this off of the toothpick how delicious okay this one doesn't taste as bad kind of tastes like lip gloss cool so now that we have um that poured in we're just gonna mix it into this butter and it's fruit punch flavored flavored i guess scented no i don't know i'm not sure but it doesn't really taste like fruit punch it does when you inhale it but the actual oil doesn't so that mixed in very very well and at this point you can just put it in the fridge and it's good to use in your recipes a nice easy infused butter i think i'm going to um scrape out the rest of my three cartridges and put them in here but because there's such little left in here it might be best to just um scrape it out with a toothpick and just kind of like eat it directly off not right now because honestly i've had too much and i can already tell it's like i'm going down a bad road with how much i've had and it hasn't even been that much but i still have to make dinner and stuff so i got to be capable of doing all that and i don't know about you guys but the one thing that i need to realize i shouldn't do when i'm high is cook because every time i cook when i'm high i mess something up and i'm not type person who usually messes things up when i cook but oh my goodness the nastiest the most gross dish i've ever made or the only like really bad dish the grossest dish i ever made was when i was high it was just i was making oh i don't want to tell you guys it was so gross but yeah so for these cards that i can't open i think i'm just going to straight up break them and do that to get the oil out um so yeah let's try that please tell me if there's a better way to open these because i feel like there must be something or i am just a major weakling and i can't open them i'm just gonna get this out of the way i'm gonna oh god how should i do this i think i'm just gonna like smack it with this oh god i'm so scared yeah okay what the heck there we go okay so i broke that there's the oil and then like i said we could put this without the sticker in um a pipe and use that because it'd be too hard to scrape this off i don't know how many times i'm going to tell you but it really does not taste good in in the mouth i need to go eat something like chewy to get get rid of the taste okay so these pieces i feel like need to go into the pipe so i'll put those there so we got all that there and then i'm gonna get my pipe this honestly feels like the most sketchy ghetto thing ever like literally smoking pieces of glass just be careful if you guys are gonna do this i'm assuming everybody is a grown up with a fully developed brain don't hurt yourself okay and then i'm literally going to smoke this these pieces of glass like a huge sketchy person but it works it really does work surprisingly now we got my glass that i'm about to hit okay let's do this yeah something's sparked so it's just like should i continue doing this you know what i don't suggest smoking the glass okay i did it if you choose to do it it wasn't me who's recommending it so just keep that in mind because that was a little bit sketchy and like what if you lit it up and then uh like glass sparked into your eye you know what i mean okay i'm so scared something's gonna hit my eyes let me just i'm still gonna do it even though i don't suggest it but just give me one second i'm back and i'm protected and i'm ready to try this again actually one second okay now that i got my personal protective equipment i think i'm ready to try this again i'm gonna get rid of that one with a little bit of something else on there i think it was like a sticker or something and let me just yeah there's still a little more there okay very fruit punch not really under the sea under the sea darling gets better down where it's wetter take it from me so the verdict is in and don't smoke glass smoke grass but yeah i took the glass out not a good idea don't do it i mean you can but i do not suggest i'm good [Music] too um um yes thank you guys again very much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video and i apologize if it's all over the place because i'm a little high right now but when i wanted to show you guys in the last like 20 minutes i had let this butter sit out when i was [Music] smoking i don't know what i was doing and this is what it looks like just so you guys can kind of see it has stayed um emulsified uh you guys can't see that too well can you there you go so yeah that's how the butter looks a little a little weird-ish texture but yeah that is just regular unsalted butter one cart and some lecithin mixed it and i'm just gonna go store this in the fridge and then i'm gonna use it maybe to make um some toast tonight perhaps okay guys so to summarize a few different ways we put our distillate directly into our oreos just open them up rub some onto the frosting we melted some butter and poured in some warmed up distillate mixed it together with a little bit of lecithin i know some people are going to say do i need lecithin no you do not if you have it use it or if you have the capsules you can break them over and put them in there but you don't need to go out and buy it it should probably be fine on its own but if you find that you're mixing it together and it's not mixing just put it in the fridge go buy some lecithin and you can always add it later it's not going to hurt anything to add it um a little bit later instead of at the same time thank you guys so much for watching this video i apologize if i am being a little bit confused in any of the video because i've been needing the oil the whole time and it's just like it's hit me and i also was smoking my glass so that hit me real hard um as well speaking of which i do have the rest of mine that i'm going to hit right now but thank you guys very much for watching i hope you guys

tryout was the 25-minute mark it's clear so let's take one of these t9 I guess they're called cartridge there was like a piece of glass stuck down in the D like I said these carts are driving me not saying more about to be done even smoking nothing but knowing okay so let's take our car squeeze it's clear it is super clear get the rest relative I don't have my good needle I had to suck a saddle that was his junkie junkie damn sucker my sucker there all right smells like the sour OG I mean it looks per deep-down phenomenal throw my excess off like I said I still got more in there but I'm just gonna try this right now to see if this battery works this one is on the charger still looks clear yeah [ __ ] man that's how you make a real card and you got to use real just one shoe I'm rocked that was 92 percent that's the thing I did a half of a quarter or whatever whatever probably like a 67 percent quarters maybe but still you can definitely feel it whenever you hit it long as this thing stays the same color yellow now tomorrow I will be 100% satisfied and totally behind my homies yesterday that's regular concentrate and we're good turned a little brown but still kept the flavor this

get to know some of the subscribers as well as know how medical cannabis has helped you and your ailments now that we got that fun out of the way go ahead and get to the fun the real fun that is like i said this is a gg4 half gram distillate cartridge over there from truly florida or original glue it's 48 for the half gram got some nice about half way down there it's got some nice clear oil in there and a nice view for you guys the uh this string type is a hybrid my opinion is a 50 50. i definitely get some nice euphoric effects as well as it definitely settles down into the mellow indica don't knock me out make me want to sleep or anything but i definitely mellow out it's not a sativa by any means particular lineage on this strain is a triple cross between three different strains chem sister sour dub and chocolate diesel all three of those strains cross to make gd4 original glue out of those three i honestly i'd like to try chocolate diesel by itself i'm not too big on uh the effects from the sour diesel strains i do like the gassy taste from it but i don't like the sativa but chocolate diesel that sounds [ __ ] nice go ahead and get another rip in here guys and then i will continue on about the strength hope you got your blunts your bones your joints bait pens whatever you do to get feeling nice and right get nice and medicate with me cheers everyone ghost got away with me but it was still a fat road make sure you stay hydrated guys when you're smoking especially when you're smoking even when you're not cheers i don't know why like carts these little vape pens over in cartridges always dry out my mouth always give me cotton mouth no matter which pic no matter what strain it is particular thc in this batch is 394.9 milligrams that comes out 78.9 percent thc 1.8 percent cbd leafly says it helps patients with stress pain and depression i agree with the the pain part definitely helped has been helping my stomach pain and nausea throughout the week i recommend this to people that like uh hybrid strains as well as need a nice daytime strain help with nausea and that kind of stuff it's a little bit of appetite stimulating you may get a little bit of munchies from it it's not a you know not very intense but i do get a little hungry when i consume this cannabis this particular strain had me feeling euphoric clear-headed um it made me want to enjoy music but then it soon made me uh mellow out didn't want to you know sleep or anything like that but i definitely just wanted to chill listen to some music and kick back that kind of thing so that's why i think it's a 50 50 hybrid in my opinion you know it's a hybrid obviously because i got that yellow [ __ ] from true leaf truly it's a hybrid it's yellow bud structure on this strain is both said to be and in my experience has been um light green with yellow pistols and hairs very um you know chunky resin covered uh very sticky buds so uh yeah you're really glue that's why gg4 that's why i got that name the glue part because it's very sticky the smell and taste on this particular strain is sweet earthy and very chemy we're going to take another rip here guys and i'll let you know what i think about that taste cheers like i said very s there's a nice sweetness to it i get the cartridge out of me nice but i got a little bit of chemical in there as well i definitely think that's coming from the chem sister as well as possibly from that uh chocolate diesel maybe i don't know a little bit of chemical there from the diesel and uh my experience every time i've had the flour it's always had a like a burnt chemical taste to it almost like a burnt tires but rubber you know how that smells that's what it tastes in my opinion so uh maybe that's how true leave is trying to uh you know represent it here in the distillate i don't know it almost tastes like chlorine like i like pool water you know when you were a little kid drinking pool or you know swallowing a little bit of pool water as a kid but not a bad way or anything nothing that would put me off just it's got that chemical taste to it it's definitely like a cam dog or a uh i don't know what else i don't know it's got like a like i said a sweet sour chemical taste to it i would definitely agree with that looking at the back here august 29th so this is about a month old every month yeah august 29th yeah about a month a month and a half here my math correct overall i definitely uh i'm enjoying this strain as well as the battery i know i've been talking a lot of [ __ ] about this battery been hyping it up from over truly for 10 bucks cannot beat it and anywhere else besides the dispenser you're not getting a battery like this for 10 bucks i guarantee that so if you have a chance to get over there truly definitely recommend picking these up like i said ten dollars you get uh two of the little metal adapter things and a little charger cable but it's just a micro usb you can use whatever if you've got an android phone it works like that the birds are real active this morning damn there's anything you'd like me to review everyone go ahead and let me know down in the comments below or over the dms on

in pa medical right here uh hundred dollars apiece for these cartridges uh they're one gram um but we're gonna uh open them up and try them on see if they're worth a hundred dollars make sure you guys hit that like subscribe and hit that bell and make sure you uh if you want to legalize medical marijuana make sure you hit that subscribe button you guys rock here we go so this one here i already did open uh i've been smoking on it i love it it's a great great great great sativa rhythm is a great company uh there you go picture of the cartridge from rhythm nice liquid don't move at all straight uh nice thick thick stuff throw it on the battery here like so like i said i've been using this one a little bit so i mean it does have uh some out of it but then we have this one here this is the gelato from alera this one is also a hundred dollars but they even bling this one out for you it has a golden blinged out uh cartridge and i did take a couple hits it was full so i mean it was fuller than that but i just figured i'd do uh the most expensive cartridges uh video but oil looks good it's a little lighter than the other stuff and to be honest with you i always thought the lighter stuff was better but i'm starting to think the darker is better i don't know but yep let's give this guy a try we'll flip his camera around and uh try these babies out now this one here is what i don't like you need a big battery for uh you need either a push button battery with a big high voltage or something like this a yo can to make this thing hit to its uh proper proper capacity because it has these air holes in the cartridge that are kind of a pain in the butt but like i said if you get a big battery uh it's not even a problem all right screw this on all right we got both cards hooked up and ready to go all right we'll start with the rhythm here this is lost coast travel diesel 1 gram 86 it's like almost 87 thc boom rhythm great company great cartridges they're half grams or a little a lot of head space in them this one here was pretty full i was really happy with it uh this has been three days now four days i had this and it's still a good bit left so i mean i'm liking how long they last it's really good oh whoa has a great uh citrusy flavor instantly three seconds in you feel it very good cartridge is it worth a hundred dollars no but very good cartridge love the taste of that lost coast travel diesel okay round two a second hundred dollar cartridge this is a gelato from alera gelato and then we'll give you the boom again like i said you need a good push battery for one of these so we've got the yo cam plus here make sure she's on she's on and here we go gelato is my favorite strain another 100 cartridge right here uh here we go that thing rips oh that gelato man i like it i really like that gelato i bought the 0.5 for like 45 or whatever it was 50 bucks uh this one here i got it for fifty dollars it was on sale i got it on a discount so i wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for these cartridges at all they're i mean they're worth it they're one grams but sell them for 85. come on give us a deal uh we should be 60 but then we go here this is the hundred dollar one here and uh like i said this one here i paid 86 for after the deals so i really didn't pay the hundred dollars for them but i did pay for them uh i don't know if they're on sale at a good price i would buy another one but i can't spend 100 on a cartridge you guys rock like subscribe hit that bell love you hey them [ __ ] got me dumb litter", "U3ZldGnlGvw": "what is going on guys it's your boy 7g back at it again with another review for us so for today's review guys we're just gonna hop straight into it man we know we haven't done a review and so long I've been kind of trying to like you know since its first of all it's the end of the year so there's not really too many other cartridges to try out and plus I am if you guys didn't know trying to evolve my content I'm not only doing cartridge reviews anymore because I kind of want it I want to do more you know I want to do more stuff so that's why I've been expanding so I've been doing a lot more collabs and more hablok sessions a lot of [ __ ] that normally wouldn't you do right but I do miss those reviews man I do definitely miss doing reviews because I don't know I feel like since that's my thing that's my thing there's there's so many people out there that tell me what like you're you're the originator of the car reviews brother like I've been watching you you're the first one to with your car because I was like I mean I didn't say the people said it man I'm kind of happy you know that people kind of know me for that because you know that's that is where I started technically some reviewing cartridges and I'm kind of I'm so happy that you know I built I built this platform from literally just reviewing cartridges but like this thing is pretty amazing he's pretty amazing so it's getting straight into the room you guys today we got a special call I have a special collab man I've been waiting to review this for the channel for so long and if I was able to go out and comp a couple of these because these are not easy to find man these are not easy to find anywhere if you're in California if you're over the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal state and you just have this make sure you guys try it man because honestly it's pretty crazy so happening - they're so friendly farms cool friendly farms X alien lab - Cola this is the area 41 hybrid and then I've I've already achieved if you guys haven't watched my top 5 cards of 2019 that video is up in that video will be down in the description below but yeah like I said I cut I copped a couple of these and I already like I literally just started chipping around this this is by far one of my favorite cartoons you know just because the taste is phenomenal everything about this cartoon is phenomenal and all right so like I said I'm gonna slap it on here when you guys get it you guys are gonna get the black tip with a little alien engraving in it and full spectrum you already know the oils gonna be a little bit darker no need to worry though full spectrum if you guys don't already know what it is pretty much you're getting every single spectrum of the cannabis plant from the taste to the feel to every pretty much everything row all inside of a pen so that's pretty amazing so I know a lot of you like to see the packaging and stuff so let me go ahead and give you guys a little closer the close-up look honestly dude friendly farms is doing some sick-ass things with with their packaging because mostly all their packaging looks like this but this alien labs co-op specifically is pretty damn sick dude I'm not gonna lie this alien labs co-op box is pretty unique dude honestly in in terms of artwork it's pretty sick it's pretty sick alright now that you guys saw the close-up of that man let's get to chief and boys I'm pretty much in this review we're gonna be media as the full taste test with a full body effects high head effects all that stuff what I like about it what I don't like about it what I wish they would have done all that good stuff you guys already know how we get down with the review guys so I'm excited man I'm excited like honestly this is this is so this is a whole different type of cartridge like honestly the taste in this is such unexplicable like insane it's insane like I've never tasted anything like this so give me you guys the full rundown on this review so area 41 alien labs ex-friend firms let's get it cheers guys and by the way if you guys do end up copying the proprietary battery from the feliforms I do recommend using a green setting anything higher than that which is I believe like the orange setting it's too hot it's too hot you're burning it too much you're wasting your oil it's always good to get such a little a little lower temp but obviously you're still going to get the clock so cheers guys if you guys are over the age of 18 21 whatever it is in your legal state I don't want any little underage kids in our that stuff in here you know we can't even enjoy it so choose [Music] so tasty bro all right so that my battery literally just died after that second hit back with that first hit so if you guys didn't see too much of clouds it was because that my the battery is dead so when also that brings up to another topic if when you use it as battery I do recommend charging all the way because it makes such a difference man that hits our way Milky Way flatter when it's fully charged compared to when it's obviously low and low and battery so let's go ahead and test hopefully this is fully charged simple choosers you could definitely tell when it's fully charged man the hit is just so much more strong I dude I'm telling you alright if I had it compared I know I said that the taste is not it's very very distinct you know I can't really compare it to anything but if I had to compare to something it has to be fall under like the lines of the cannabis drive terpenes from Suzy like those pods are so Turkey and so flavorful and when you hit them they're just so gassy and you honestly only taste like the straight-up but dude you just just trade it like straight bud no no preservatives no additives into that [ __ ] whoo shout to hydro hydro flaps if he has her oh geez on the challenge guys know I've been having this thing since day one right so uh for that first first two second initial hit you know right off the bat I feel my eyes getting heavy and that's that that has a lot to say dude because those two hits were very very very small in terms of the vapor products that you know yeah so for it to have that much packing so it's such a little hit it's pretty crazy so and the taste like I said super gassy super Turkey you don't taste no oil as it doesn't taste boilie and all I can like dis lids they usually do and it's something that you want to keep on hitting honestly and something's just so distinct that you're like hmm well you just want to keep tasting it because you've never tasted it before so cheers guys let's go in for another hit and then right away you want to enter your lungs they're like the longest benches instant dude it instantly guy I want to coughing so and on that exhale I'm getting like a little like some undertones of you know how like when you take like a pretty wanna temp tab you get those little it's taste like Turkey dude it tastes like turkey warm Turks in there you know and it just like fills up and lingers in your mouth and it's like cow like like like if you just baked some lie president you feel me like not not not cooked it bake it it you know when you bake something you get that aroma you get that full flavor taste that's kind of like what like you know baking out here boys I know I don't know if that makes any sense but you know making up new terms every day so when you go in on another one man because this thing is phenomenal I can't get off of it so even what I know I said let's not go to higher setting but I just want to see I just want to see how it compares on this cartridge so choose oh yeah that is what that is definitely way too hot like it tastes a little bit more burn so than anything not even burnt but a little bit too hot in my opinion like a hot attempt ugh I like those little lower temp ones and honestly man I know I keep saying dab and this is a pimp but this pen literally makes you feel like you're taking a DAB and the funny thing is I've tasted their full spectrum salt and it's literally it tastes exactly similarly super super similar like this taste that this taste that friendly firm produces is very very unlike be replicable and like it's kind of like like just just straight-up fire dude I don't know how to explain it like the taste like I keep trying to like bring out what the what the pinpoint tastes this but I just can't I just can't mmm so like I said the hi man I'm definitely feeling it more drawn my head than I am my body and then again it we've only been pinning in for like five to seven minutes so I'm pretty sure the longer I wait the more I'll feel their effects and it's a good smoke man it's a good smoke definitely you know and something's so exotic this isn't something gonna be picking up on the regular man definitely not getting picking up gonna be picking this up on a regular bed because the price there the price range is a little bit more up there you feel me compared to other cartridges that's why a lot of people don't really mess with with filming phones because they go into the shot they see the prices and then they're like the bounce I'll go to rock garden whatever whatever the lower end price is you know so but if you guys are in the market you know got a little bit extra money that you know is there the Christmas and maybe you guys got some extra Christmas money and you guys are in the looks for new cartridge alien laps X from the forums definitely check them out so we're gonna end this review out here guys I know it's it feels a little bit different reviewing this time I don't know what it is I just maybe I'm falling out of the reviews you know I feel like a lot of people have been coming out of cartridges so there's not there hasn't really been a lot of search for a new cartridge reason I feel like the time that I got into it was perfect because I was when cartridges were popping you know I got my I got my people and I got my viewers locked down you know things like that I think it's time to now progress on to the next thing which is you know going out session event doing big big whole lives with bigger people mr. TC you has seen that collab with Edwin sparks you guys having go ahead and go check that I'll put that description below and you know which is we're just working man we're just working we're just

cartridges before if they have that strong agitation or let me know so the total carnival noises 87% you know it's been a while since I don't select you know these I used to [ __ ] with select heavy I used to get one of these a lot no every week Gracie [ __ ] would select so and I don't know where I just you know like I expanded I started trying new things you don't [ __ ] it when your cartridges

some different kinds and [ __ ] these are one of the ones that hit the most you know you get big clouds so you go ahead and take it out so we're gonna go try hit it I'm gonna let you guys know if it's like if it's like really fruity so this is a citrus up you know I'm gonna be doing a dad in video if you guys you guys stay tuned for that you know I already done I still need an editor and [ __ ] so I probably have like two videos uploaded at once so yes stay tuned for that so here we have the whole ever know and flip it over it's pretty nice to go you know garance looks pretty good but they could do better like in the flavor why isn't she I don't know if they Todd what's the process they do it but most of these cartridges they kind of taste the same to me so yeah guys pack on this flight 35 attacks she's not bad you know so not here in Cali do the bubble test I really appreciate my new subscribers if it wasn't for you guys you guys I wouldn't be where I'm at right now you know you

big [ __ ] paddy and they [ __ ] rip so we're gonna enjoy hit this and we're gonna see if there's some flavors of it yeah I'm not lying to you I can't read it tastes like that strong catchy tasting this one and that's why I kind of like stop [ __ ] with select because they just have that strong hash taste to I mean it's not bad like I said but it's like I want to taste some mouths besides I want to try some fruity that's what I grabbed the citrus tabs or they don't taste like citrusy I probably I don't know probably want to stop I'll stop buying select so we're gonna hit this cheese if you got a smoke along with me go ahead and do so bring out your bongs pies whatever the [ __ ] you guys got to KI this one along with me cheers guys yeah guys it tastes it tastes clean it tastes good but it tastes like exactly like the other cartridge I had a gun like two weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to like rock gardens and I'm know if you guys heard of bear labs I probably get like a half gram with some bear labs or I don't know this just I'm not grabbing the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things but sometimes it's just I run out of options you know but that likes Dizzy's they have plug plays I have a whole bunch of [ __ ] you know so you guys just let me know like on the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see in the future and yeah if you guys like hot box of videos you know I

well yeah these cartridges right here they [ __ ] rip these see Stiles right here with the c-23 these are like one of the best cartoons you guys can have oil in because they [ __ ] [ __ ] but oil goes too quick so the high on these cartridges they're pretty good don't get me wrong you get I'm like you know you feel like the quick buzz like after like two big hits you feel like a good buzz off him this was a hybrid this one's a hybrid so you know you get the boat effects you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about so you guys let me know in a comment section if you guys like these or not so or which or which ones you guys have favorite flavor and let me know in the comments section I would I'm just curious mind guys hope you guys having a really good day and stay blessed cheers guys peace", "pKfDiX-2pVE": "YouTube

cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try white fire

at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm use the code rough 2 to get a free gift and

just [ __ ] fly so as you can see by the title which I don't even own a name yet about to talk about this role Clark I got the tangi and I'm start off by telling you he's a video not a video don't telling you the story about how one of my professors know what was hot was this wasn't this wasn't during during academic hours but this [ __ ] was that she was she was kind of crazy yeah just think of that back if I said that she was kind of crazy like yeah we got the row of tangi here [ __ ] [ __ ] is on it I also had the Kush indica which so far as to be like my favorite indica from though she the [ __ ] label right there she yeah bro I was actually scared these shits might be fake but they're not as you can see the [ __ ] in the soil does not move oh [ __ ] does not at all that [ __ ] dick makes you that's just miss banai so far but yeah I just came back from the gym and this is city bus like I wasn't Oh Dee hi but like I was I was I was pretty geeked off this [ __ ] I was I was I but like ya know now I'm just like reviewing you know I was like yeah all right let's take the first draw post Jim post shower still my job when I first started ripping it like it was like a citrusy grapefruit tastes like to me like that [ __ ] was like grapefruit which was [ __ ] fire that sure was [ __ ] legit like yeah I don't really to me with the carts like I don't really care about taste that much like the taste doesn't matter to me it's like it's the quality of the higher like I'm now I'm not like that that picky with it but like if it does have like a flavor to like change your eating like Usher's like blueberries sonson time when I had cush like my first draw out of cush was like legit like like [ __ ] like blueberry bro like it's like I put a blueberry in my mouth and like ate that [ __ ] like without washing it like that [ __ ] was that [ __ ] was [ __ ] fire and like I let's just say I'm more of an indica person cuz like when I smoke I don't want to be like slumped now I mean like I want to be like in the couch it's like thinking about [ __ ] just relax and like chilling but yeah like just to switch it up I got I got a sativa make it a hybrid next time like they have like row has a whole bunch of other [ __ ] like they got like sherbert OG Skywalker they got like a whole bunch of [ __ ] but like DD [ __ ] dude they're fire yeah I'm chill as you can probably like you Bullock yeah like animal talk about like carts do but like yeah this was this was last year's my sophomore year of like school and then [ __ ] me woman one of my boys we were what we did we just like smoked a blunt and we just walk into us and he's walking to see a soccer game and what am i professor so me my boy we went to the soccer game and one of my professors was there so like my dumb ass not knowing that lady did not like understanding the situation look walked up to him it was like oh hey was so professor and then he looked at me and looked at me and he was like oh what's up and then took another look at me had a little like lowly like realization it was like let's let's talk tomorrow let's let's talk tomorrow dream class if you have any questions so I was like okay all right I walked away like we did managed imagine what was high it was like nah Bullock yeah like that [ __ ] was [ __ ] hilarious but we're still cool like we're chill about you know it's it's pretty - its I even even though I've never I've never I've never brought it huh never brought it up Blake yeah let me take another rib in terms of like lasting me these like lasts me like a week usually a week to two weeks just about like how much like how much I like [ __ ] smoking [ __ ] but like yeah like these D shits are legit duh they're not it's not the best one I've had but like they still slacked out the best one out the best [ __ ] the best [ __ ] cart that I've ever died was a TKO car bro like that [ __ ] the indica like that [ __ ] just knocked me on my [ __ ] ass bro like I was on a different realm in [ __ ] huh like that [ __ ] was just crazy like that [ __ ] that [ __ ] was just slap if I was to describe the high like I'm not like swamped but like I'm just like relaxed like I'm just dumb relaxed like it's it's I guess in my head I mean like however you want to [ __ ] describe oh [ __ ] a [ __ ] sativa really like this is another thing I was thinking about like I like it's like when like before if I did this like I'd like look at other people's like reviews for carts to see like if I should buy it and [ __ ] and like I'd look at some of the comment sections and that [ __ ] would be like like [ __ ] oh like if you're in a legal state then like it's thick it's fake and like it's a fake car and I'm like but wait like wait what constitutes a real car like based on governmental standards like that have just been implemented or like what what were my Huggies doing before it cuz like there were restrictions on it everywhere so like who's to say like you can't get like [ __ ] it's like breaking bad bro like literally it's like who the [ __ ] is to say you can't get a Heisenberg who gets these shits up to like up to like 90 percent and like it's see like oh and like it's safe because it's weed it's not [ __ ] like it's not [ __ ] crystal meth bro but like what if you get a Heisenberg who just [ __ ] like just just has like the purest [ __ ] like that's just not sanctioned by the [ __ ] government so it's oil anyway and like bro it has a label on it of course of course this is like a like a drug it can't be like and can't be like compared to like food and [ __ ] and like food packaging labels or like the food industry like if you go to [ __ ] like like where where they keep like [ __ ] baby chickens and [ __ ] like you see those [ __ ] conditions are terrible bro and like that's the [ __ ] that you're eating that's a [ __ ] that we're eating like so who's to say it can't be the same like with with [ __ ] marijuana or let alone crystal meth with Heisenberg you think [ __ ] yeah like this this [ __ ] is this shits fire i [ __ ] with it be it's like what constitutes like real and fake marijuana burly Pete like I don't think legalizing weed is gonna is gonna like stop people from getting from the regular dealers cuz like if I like how I get it and it's probably cheaper than the [ __ ] that they're [ __ ] selling in a dispensary then why wouldn't I get that you know what I mean especially if you're in an in an illegal state like people smoke weed everywhere like legality has nothing to do with [ __ ] wheat you know what I mean like just cuz you're in Cali you smoke weed doesn't mean you have [ __ ] grade-a [ __ ] compared to what someone else has especially if it's regulated by the government dude it may be a lot safer but it's not to say that people who grow outside of like got like outside of like governmental regulations don't grow efficiently or use like or use pesticides or [ __ ] like that you know what I mean but yeah that's just like my two cents on it I'm like yeah have you happy cause you knew myself as [ __ ] like [ __ ] check out row cars this is fire I take like three pools and I'm good like do you think I'm just chilling especially because it's just a TiVo but yeah like check this [ __ ] out there's what my first video we just looking fire using my [ __ ] and like I don't know I don't even know no name the [ __ ] channel at the light you'll forget I should I sing enough bro", "aYqngjuJ1tM": "hello everyone cheapestvapesupplies.com uh we got a new product and lately um it's a wax cartridge for concentrate uh comes in two different styles we got a um a ceramic mouthpiece in white as you can see here if you look carefully in there there's a dab tool you see a little metal piece coming down from the cartridge here it's a dab tool so as you can see on the inside here you got yours your coil here your wax coil ceramic coil for wax um and then when you put the dab tool in here it sits right on top of that so whatever you dab is going to fall right into that area below these are real nice we have tried them already we're going to do a demo here right now for you with a loaded up one we already have we have two different styles we have this one here and then we also have this one here it's got a glass tip as opposed to the ceramic so those are the two styles ceramic white tip or glass tip they're both equally the same cartridge just the tips are different you have one loaded up here a little bit of concentrate on here from uh as you can see in here a little bit of shatter so so this right here you're gonna just we already got it loaded up with one of these uh zooted batteries here we sell these on our site so as you can see it's opened up you can see the coil area down there so we're just going to go ahead and put it right in there and you can see it touching the coil right there it's just hovering right over it so here we go really good hit for the first hit we had no absorption right off the bat it was just a dry hit so that was really good for the first hit real big hit second hits are always going to be larger because the oil gets the oil will absorb in the coil area here for the first hit after the first hit i should say so the second will be a little bit better here both really good hits um this is a small battery being a 650 mah if you put something on here stronger with a little bit stronger voltage without getting too crazy this thing could probably put out some major major hits um we're going to be selling these two cartridges on our website cheapestvapesupplies.com they should be uploaded here today tomorrow um hopefully we'll get them on there today saturday hopefully they'll be on there today check them out um really cool product uh we have a lot of people liking them already that have already sampled them check them out cheapestvapesupplies.com have a great day everybody", "DpXEya_eY2s": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka x420 and we're back here for another video guys it's just another chill-ass day it's actually nice and bright today it's actually pretty warm compared to the last couple days where it's just been cold and rainy and stuff um i'm out here in california but today guys man we're um this week has just been a budget week i bought a whole bunch of budget cards so your boy is doing budget cart reviews today so today i got a honey leaf and i'm trying this [ __ ] so you guys don't have to man but um honey leaves they're pretty cheap distillate but i've heard they're pretty good and i've never tried one or at least i've tried one but i've never tried one on the channel i've only tried them like you know in passing one of the homies had one so you know i ended up buying it but i got the northern lights and um it has 92 percent thc it's pretty freaking high in thc but that's a given with the distillate and it has 2.26 cbd guys so your boy we got the ursa bat today shout out to um ursa extracts i came home today and i got two packages um one from ursa x-straps and one from another company they sent me a gravity bomb but shout out to ursa extracts i love the lanyards because i love wearing a battery around my neck you feel me if i ever get big you know i won't have a chain your boy's gonna have lanyards with like different cards like different lanyards with different carts on it feel me so let's open this baby up and let's get into it [Music] like i'm not a big dislike fans but these carts are like 20 bucks 15 20 bucks a gram so when you hear that price you're just like huh should i try it should i try is it worth it do you guys think it's worth it so let's check it out see what it looks like [Music] the oil looks actually looks pretty good i'm not going to get a super close up but you guys can see it it's like a super gold color um darker than raw garden darker than a lot of distillate cards too in my opinion um but let's put it on [Music] and it looks like it's just in like some cheap cars not in an avd card or c cell it doesn't even have a name so you know you gotta watch out for those type of cards guys with either c cell or avd avd cards or one of the cards or any type of ceramic um but avd is um one of the big brands that are kind of dropping their carts and they have ceramic coils inside of them so they look like a normal sea cell but inside they actually have ceramic coils but shout out to ursa extracts man they got a full ceramic cart that's crazy so we might have to get pick up some ursa extract soon a strain that i haven't tried yet or something so cheers guys we're gonna take a rip of this northern lights it's not bad [Music] it's not bad but it's also you know not my type of flavor like it just tastes too much like it doesn't taste like they put any kind of terpenes or anything in it sorry i'm trying to get a fat rip i have it on red on this battery but if you guys don't know ursa strikes batteries uh they only go up to 2.0 voltage so sorry if it doesn't look like i'm hitting it but i'm actually i'm hitting this [Music] [Music] but this is good i guess if you're on a budget you need this lit but it's not the best distillate i don't know if it's just the terpenes they put in it or it's just because they barely put any terpenes or anything flavor but i don't know it just tastes like like basic distillate if you guys ever um had friends who just had a jar distillate and you ever just took in a dab or smoked a little bit of this religious straight distillate you guys kind of know it kind of tastes like that in a way [Music] man i gotta take super heavy hits to get nice hits off of this ursa battery but i do like the ursa battery but yeah guys man i don't know if i like this i would give this cart a rating like six six out of ten just because i would buy this if i was on a budget and this is all i could buy to get me through you know a couple weeks but i would rather go for a raw garden or a stizzy type distillate or any other this one's not as good like i think papa herbs is better than this one i would say papa herbs distill it is way [Music] better but yeah guys man today is just a chill day i just got back from work got some hennessy coming because

I'm testing out this road for you today I got this sativa tangi forgot my pants I was working on my car earlier so I gotten kind of dirty but it's fine first off right off the bat I gotta say this is a nice looking car it's a really cool looking I like the black chrome I like the you know little row of emblems on it I do have to say that this chamber looks a little small I don't think it's as large as the pure vape karts you know point five but it does taste really good I've been hitting this for a little bit now I feel really nice and high I don't feel like overly you know active I don't have like any like weird anxiety or anything from the sativa it's a good feeling I do have to say it's not quite as strong as like a przemek an sativa but it does keep me up a little bitter so that's good I would say it's a little bit stronger than the pure like jack hair this would be a little stronger than that but again you know the tube in here is really big and I just feel like this does not have as much liquid as some other point fives I would say it probably has about as much as the Prima can does so I mean it's no big deal but it tastes really good so I feel like that makes up for it Oh Rose I am gonna have to give them a thumbs up right now I'm feeling really good you know it's worth it if you can get these for 30 bucks that's a good deal I wouldn't go too much higher than that so I mean yeah it's a good good company pros you know nice and strong you know tastes really good Kahn's feel like there's not a lot of liquid in there and they're a little pricey but other than that you know go for it definitely definitely give road with thumbs up I want to try some other ones I want to try some indicas and stuff so stay tuned for that go ahead and subscribe and I'm gonna be doing a lot more you know vape test I'm gonna be doing some obscure companies out there so be sure to subscribe and check out for that because I'm gonna be testing them all you know the bad ones the good ones and letting you guys know so yeah go ahead and subscribe catch you guys later right", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "A2k1Q7rTNJg": "hey everybody its cannon Joe we are checking in today at Stinson Beach California one of our last days out in California and today we are very excited to review a Willys reserve distillate cartridge this is Mountain mist this is the flavor and we were super lucky enough to be introduced to a woman that basically gave us these and donated these products here to us from Flo Canada and we are very very excited to try this Willy's reserve as a Willie Nelson brand and of course everybody hears about that and they want to try it out and here today we are about to so let's just go ahead and get in on it so we've got our warnings of course this is awesome packaging I really like it local farmers you can check it out online recyclable packaging that's cool yeah this is nice packaging everything's nice I like the colors really stands out they did a good job they're got Willie Nelson in the background right there that's cool 81 percent THC again this is a distillate and then you've got 0.33% of CBD so oh I like that big packaging there I've never seen one like this now okay but you take that out like that wow this is this is a heavy-duty case right here [Music] okay that was an extremely long horn blow again we are at a beach so it's probably the get in or get out of the water call so here we go this cartridge is very high-quality we've got like a stainless steel feel here on the mouth tip it's a very large hole this is uh it's heavy too it's got the WR right there on the right there on the logo and so we're gonna just go ahead and try it out here see what happens okay here we go mmm that's good lemony hmm Wow mmm that's got everything you're looking for I mean it's got the Terp tic it's got the back of the throat choke it's got the whole tickle in the nose it's got pretty much everything but it's not bad in any way shape or form because a lot of the times that all those things can go into a bad you know they can be too much term tech too much choke throughout all them things that you don't want but this is pretty much all that you do let's try this again just get one more try see what really happens excuse me I didn't expect that okay who's that my friends excuse me all right so you want to be careful with this this is no joke this is not a joke this is the lowest temp a lot of times with your vape pens you know you can take the whole hit sometimes maybe even two you can time out the pin to really get the flavor saver going but this one here no this is a one I mean you can barely get through one time out with this and yeah I feel I feel a little on the road again so yeah I definitely appreciate this this is an awesome pin I give it pretty much a 10 let's give it a 10", "SLihlyzlkHE": "hey guys new cat discount vape pen and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like the new these products they're available for purchase on our website at discount vape pen calm you feel like the video give us a like and subscribe [Music] [Applause] you", "i-vbmMqxtQg": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] butas up DGC scotty real and hanging out today have my buddy Damien from natty REM show up and man thanks showing up the bakery brother yeah no problem yeah actually thanks for showing up at the concentration celebration you know that was so much fun thanks for having us hey guys [ __ ] crushed it over there man has some beautiful contact UK cheesy all entered yeah that one's a great one it uh it tastes like a blueberry muffin and it's about like a like a 50/50 hybrid yeah it has us just [ __ ] is this man that's the banana couch livers and cartridge yeah this thing's fruity is all hell yeah that's why I invited him over I asked him he's got a fat has anything interesting going on and he says you got to taste the live resin cartridges and I've actually recently gotten into these I started buying a few different brands auditioning them but it's just Turkey as a [ __ ] and thank you so much as I'm surprising because I don't normally get super high off these and unfortunately I got super high before we're doing our interview so yeah let you know how it works but yeah delicious man the libraries and then that is a hundred percent pure uncut we don't put anything in it and we just keep it that way I'm gonna try to match like the turkey and profile as much as we can it didn't help me out with okay so the first cartridges that came out I completely dismissed them cuz I tasted on my taste propylene glycol I was at an event last night down in Denver and people were showing off their their new technology and I tasted a cart and it was just it tasted like bait juice it tasted like you know and I was just like dude I don't think you know I mean I don't want that [ __ ] yeah unfortunately like when when vape cartridges and pens are getting really popular if that's all you were tasting this PG and then people start cutting with dislike because of it cut similar right it was not as like harmful to your body as PG but now it's the point where we can have libraries and cartridges and then our next step personally is going to be a solvent cartridge as well all right interesting now now sama I hear these solvent lists newts all the time man that will only do solvent list and everything yeah I like them both I really do we do - honestly well most of our lives smokes butane or not butane but BHO and then a lot of us also smoke live rosin or don't let me hit this I'm gonna be I'll be too [ __ ] all right so what's it explain to me just because I'm trying to learn about cartridges I'm sure other people are what's the difference between the cheap cartridge at the dispensary in the AO and the $50 one it's all about quality there's a lot of companies that are more about quantity so that's the peak those are the guys that are cutting it would probably glycol and that kind of stuff yeah it's a lot easier it's a lot easier for your resin to get into that liquid form when you're cutting a PG or distillate so I could smoke it without it buttering or sugaring or crashing Lots inside the cartridge but we found a way where you don't have to mix it with any of that and you can just literally pour the live resin right into the pin and close it and give it to the customer a sick and that that's when these things have really evolved now I went to a concert recently just two nights ago and I'm normally used to having a bowl or a one-e-and and some container for flour or even if I have one of those pins you know if I got like a goby or something like that I got to go be I got the shatter that I'm loading it with I got something to get the wax off my fingers yeah these are [ __ ] easy and they're a little too easy but I just thought I was gonna hit one now I can easily smoke one of these cards she's just like sitting at home or right if it's the Durbin poison and writing like all the dishes in my entire house or love it you know all the tours so so this is just terpenes you get to like get to back to my education so when they when you distill or I'm sorry when you run something through a column you get what the I don't know how to like what they pick the Diamonds out of the terpenes and then they use the terpenes to make this sauce is that right or to make it live these parts with the with the live resin we're able to pack the column the shoot butane through the column right so what you get is the butane the cannabinoids and the terpenes and then you pull that butane out of the terpenes that cannabinoid right so then that's what we put into the pin so you're getting everything that you would get if you sucked like the diamonds and drank the sugar if you salt the butter anything like that but it's all in a cartridge now Varian just okay I love it I'm starting to get an understanding here so you said pull the butane out what's that wood residual butane and all that stuff is that something you got to worry about it's nothing that we have to worry about too much we've been in the game for a while over a century now and so we have over a century over a century and we're there for a hundred years no not centuries I told you these things it was him and Henry Ford it's our decade yeah no we actually have been in the company for a decade now and what we've been doing is like fine-tuning that tech so now we don't have any of those issues that's cool I mean it doesn't taste like anything but but turps honestly thank you yeah it's actually we try to match the exact terpene profile that you would get with the actual cannabis plant interest like a banana cush there's the Michelle gross banana that's what the banana cush is actually tasting like 1980s that's when the plant was produced and so that's why they named it banana cush because it was that banana that was hard to find at that time and when you say matched herpes I don't understand what that means um so when you smoke the plant or when you smoke the bud and it's like even from like the from the original breeder you're still gonna get around the same terpene profile sure and so what you smell in that grow is what we're trying to capture and keep inside that cartridge is what it's like a recipe um it's not a recipe it's like a it's like a natural recipe that the plant produces okay so you thought we're trying to keep it the entire time while preserving the terpene profile I'm not adding terpenes no just now I get it don't add anything yeah excellent makes sense man so we were talking about the big word the buzzword in our industry is vertical integration are you vertically integrated men and all that means is that do you have everything from your own grow to your own processing facility I guess sometimes it means your own dispensary right yes we're completely vertically integrated we do have outside processing on the side because you've good adding yeah so what doubt side processing means some growers ask you to process their [ __ ] yeah so we have a lot of companies similar to like it cut above where they will give us our fresh frozen and we will process that fresh frozen for them right and send it back to them so they could sell out their store but at the same time we also process our own in-house and that's about 95 to 90 percent of our in-house or all of our processing is in-house and so with that in-house then we sell all that wholesale throughout Colorado God so if I wanted a natty Rams cart I should ask for him by name though if you want an atom's car I suggest following us on Instagram you can sign up for a newsletter where we drop every week where we drop all the cartridges that's enough for a newsletter to get one of these made come on you got a store fine or something we also have a sore point deal that makes all right so as far as managing a grow as far as managing quality control I'll be I want to tell you a story that I got some edibles I've been getting into and actually going back to the dispensary recently got me some carts and got me some edibles and I tried this I said what's the most bang for the buck for edibles like 2000 milligrams in this tincture well I tried and it's bunk you know I mean just had nothing going on it and I'd [ __ ] drink half the bottle there's actually frightened for the first hour thinking it was gonna kick in I never did yeah it's all about quality control but I mean so and actually I went back to the dispensary who's my local dispenser really cool folks and I was like hey I want to show you guys this stuff seems like it's bunk no you can't even bring that in the store holy cow I can't give you a refund and it was like you realized what a yellow hour our hands are tied on doing business you know even the advertising credit card processing it's so difficult in business you know definitely well even as far as quality control how do you guys handle that well from grow all the way to selling and processing and getting it out the door there's always quality control so we start from the clone as it's growing there's always people checking it right and sure all the plants look good then as it's getting harvested and getting frozen there's another quality check and then as it's getting processed and then as it's getting created and then that's getting packaged in years out the door there's always the quality control check it's just even kind of corporate here man do you got white lab coats and stuff no it's not it's not very coke right it's more just the whole team cares like we all look at it we're always inspecting it even if we're not told to so you're hoping that we're just like naturally looking at smelling it making sure it's like the actual thing and it's not that we have that issue but there's so many different strains and there's there's always like different phenotype we'll checking making sure it's like everything that we want man I'm thinking I have a bamboo nursery a 20-acre bamboo nursery down in Florida can we do like 20 different varieties like I'm 20 different strains and I just think about the quality control that we have and what it really comes down to is if we lose a thousand plants that's a thousand plants you have to fungus or something that's a thousand plants that those guys work their ass off on it's also a matter of pride they're actually producing something so there's a you know it's just a inclination a pride to actually produce something amazing yeah we try to keep that tegrity and we tried to did you say tegrity yeah I love it a farm no but there's a we always try to keep that Tiger tea and we always try to make sure we give the love that each plant deserves just as if it was one of six plants in a basement so I guess it is but as you expand it's like you have to make sure that you are that efficient precise and so then you can slowly grow with the rest of the company yeah yeah you say slowly grow as the rest of the company yeah I know a bit gonna dunk your time I know about growing but I'm always interested in what's going on with this industry as far as what's going on like I don't know as far as I see Oklahoma blowing up now there's all the Michigan blowing up I'm a little bit confused about the state of the industry nobody gets to do interstate commerce anymore or ever I should say what do you guys think about that where do you see the industry in five years so they gotta open that up and I kind of national legalization what do you think I think it's gonna take around like three to five or even more years just for like that to switch over and basically because of the tax code that's with federal government right now is that way you know the more I think about it and the more I study it the more it just has to do with money or how they collect the money you think it'll take that long they're pretty good at figuring out how to collect money I don't know it's like since the beginning they always had a way for them to collect money even if we thought that all of our money was going to the public and it was going to for Denver is going to the homeless look even if we think all the money is going towards that they're still making good amount of money she's messed up in the in the system or in the industry then you get a fee and that fee is like out the door grabber aegis yeah yeah I've heard stuff goes yeah I've heard stories so a bedroll legalization who still stinks five years away four or five years away um I mean we're not holding our breath for right now right um it would be great if it did happen you all were looking forward to it yeah most companies I talk to her like hey and I'm doing just fine in this in this niche I just had a lot of money to get here yeah I'm not looking forward to competing what sold out what do you think about competing with I'm pretty confident that we can compete with them as we're growing we're getting more excited and our coffins is getting like bigger and bigger and it's been more than 10 years and we have just been sitting back and like making sure everything is exactly the way that we want it right we're out trying to jump a gun too quickly and in the next six months or so it's gonna start building a little bit bigger and then after that then I would in about two three years we plan to be in multiple states so yeah that's all it takes that long to [ __ ] expand huh yeah I mean I guess you got to get a grow set you got to get a location you gotta get like successor is that what the big the big hang-up is licenses yes they give you a license you can [ __ ] hit the ground running yeah it's just one of the first tube so you have to jump through just a interesting man so a dude if so if you could change anything if you were in charge of cannabis policy man any ideas man could you fix this get any big ideas if there was one big change I would try to have like all the companies in the cannabis industry try to work together cuz right now it's a lot of competition right and if we all actually work together and talk together then I think it would be easier for all the companies individually and how do you do that one it's such a hard product of just English you got such an that's hard it is tough I mean we try to set up as many meetings as we can with different companies and try to collaborate with them and like become like one solid team the beer companies do it though yeah the beer companies aren't all at each other's throat you go to a tap room and there's 25 different taps from 10 different you know 15 different breweries so here we're figuring away everybody's got to have their niche these are interesting it's y'all's niche yeah uh yeah I think I like it yeah yeah he's a nice easy chair everybody like said there's not even a button on it it's just one pole it's easy to get in man it's easy to get into a show or something like that anywhere you want let's go for concerts and events yeah obviously as a as a professional company because it's just that like you bring into a concert or anything like that but like it's the perfect thing all right I gotta ask man everybody's always even dreaming in prohibition land if I could just go to Colorado or California Michigan and work at a cannabis company man that'd be amazing that'd be living my dream almost like like winning a lottery don't yell don't uh don't wish for things that you don't understand yeah so is that something that if if I went to a cannabis company do I get to just smoke all day do I get to dab all day is it [ __ ] yeah no tell me about it first and then dabs later okay um we we always go in like early in the morning hit the ground running um just so we can get as much work as we can right into the end of the day and then after that you can relax and you can like with that we usually hang out with each other after work sure um but yeah we can hang out we could smoke and all that kind of stuff but yeah when it comes to work it's very straightforward we get stuff done he makes sense she just fired up what time you guys fired up in the morn then I got enough I was talking to because I was talking to an extract artist yesterday just ten hour shifts [ __ ] yeah our shifts on the rig this for personally for me I think I wake up around like 3:30 4 o'clock in the morning such as that and then guys are dedicated oh yeah yeah I start checking my email probably like around like 5:30 all right get into the grow around like 6:00 6:30 and then I'm there and sometimes until like 7 8 o'clock at night Jesus Christ man what happened out yeah geez how do you keep motivated like that it's insane well just like honestly it's great working in like our facility because everybody is like integrated so there's wrong in the lab and everybody works together around the same place so like if you look over and you see like a seven-foot plant I just got chopped down that goes by the harvest sure then like obviously like that's gonna get you hyped up because right oh man that's going straight to fresh frozen we're just gonna concentrate which might go on are these pens so is it ironic but you have to go into the bathroom and sneak some cokes to the pen then no just [ __ ] yeah kind of like the office with how many cameras are set up at the Grove for like yeah yeah oh it's actually some place so actually somebody put a meme up that was like you know back I deal 10 years ago I was hiding in the woods to try to smoke a you know a bowl with my friends yeah and now it's like you know 2019 it's like should I hit this pen and target yeah I love it the Internet is just probably like I'd say like the Internet is thriving just as much as the cannabis industry is right now share this from the tools we get are absolutely amazing you know like that you know being able to use Instagram being able yeah was that a kind of professionals association I don't know how they that man knows a bunch of cannabis professionals and I didn't have any business cards so just like nah just follow our instagram oops I need to do what's your Instagram I'll catch you there yeah mine's actually digital about

nearly as faded as this but this shit's like a killer it's [ __ ] dank like it makes him like hard to breathe after which is weird like it looks like it comes with you as you can see like it doesn't look full and it's like that all the way around and like I've only been using it mine for a day it's already there but like I don't know what's up with that but it's a really wide cartridge so I don't

video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "FGAEMze9fNQ": "main character is what am i called the mind its mastery its capacity to represent throughout history attempts have been made to contain that those experiences happen at the age of the limit where the mind is vulnerable but I think we are at a very significant moment in history what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be another Nate cartridge review it is a proprietary I wouldn't say proprietary but it is like they have a battery for that specific cartridge and from the looks of it this chill very very much similar to that of orchid essentials but you know they have their own twist on anything at different flavors all that good stuff but I picked this up at haul of flowers for only two dollars so I don't know the exact price of this but I will post all their information or on the screen I'm not too sure if I'm gonna post it in the bottom description below just because I've been getting this is my third channel now and I don't want to risk linking to any other sites or whatever so I'm just gonna post on the screen now I'm saying and just you know you could check out their Instagram by typing in yourself manually I just feel like this is the better way for me to go about my channel because this Bureau I don't honestly I don't want to be deleted again so I'm trying to take the extra precautions of not to get deleted but at the same time I could get deleted again so I mean whatever but you know let's just make this a less of a chance for me to get deleted you know zine so I mean right here off the bat you see sour apricot good stuff chill is the brand yeah but the back you can pause if I'm going too fast guys I know I'm usually yes oh yes but as you can see right here it is a distillate paid cartridge so definitely something that we've tried before it is turn in terms of you know the oil like we tried to slip before but let's try to get this out so there is a thing right here just get that open for you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on today as usual you know I'm saying it's just this is life's better when you chill and you got a you got a hold these two little thing right here and a little thing right here very very nice so we're going to sit this down right here we have a micro USB charger you know I'm saying it's a the braided cords as well so I mean it's a small cord I think they only use the braided to like have less tangles on your cords play if it's this small I mean it's not really necessary in turn win a $2,500 for a location of your choosing once you get away from all the chill text winner to that and you will be entered for a chance to win $25,000 I mean $22,500 as well as a chance to win other cool daily prizes check them out at chill calm chill keishon all that good stuff then thank you for choosing chill with us our team of growers and connoisseurs go to great lengths to deliver the careful balance of quality flavor and potential potency in all our products why because we believe that the feel-good effects of cannabis and community go hand-in-hand I don't know if they want me to show that I mean they have in here they probably want me to show there you have it very very nice paper go [ __ ] never seen paper like this um basic stuff with that you know and it says all the stuff that's better when you chill so you could pause if I'm going too fast but I'm gonna get straight into the to the pen because I mean I've been doing this for so long five times to turn off three times have changed you know all that good stuff so the cartridge itself very very nice very very and it is a distillate guy so you will see it kind of move I'm actually not seeing it move but I mean I left it upside down in the package before and I seen it move so but very very thick the battery for a very very nice looking sleek gunmetal dope just just a nice overall pen all right since these are different I gotta read it at least so five times to turn it off uh click three times to enter so you click it three times and then you press it again to adjust then you hold it down oh okay so basically three times and then you adjust it with each one but then you hold it for two seconds to stop it it's a bit different but not too hard to understand cheers guys there is no preheating so we're just gonna go at it Cheers whoa cloud productions there this live it does taste like apricots I'm not gonna lie very very much like apricot it is a hybrid as well and as far as distillate goes you guys already know what distally it's unflavored the final product it's unflavored and then they add terpenes into it so if you guys are like into that stuff you know like plug and play or this horse dizzy and I really recommend it like people will just see this and think it's just another vape in and I'm not gonna lie for our artificial fruit Terps I'm liking this apricot it's pretty good I'm not even a fan of apricot but it's pretty good mmm let me hit it again where you guys it's definitely not lacking in vapor production and uh as far as like the price goes I'm guessing that this is going to be costing you a pretty penny like I'm guessing maybe around 50 to around 90 maybe 90 for the whole kit because you know with the battery they usually sell things with the battery for more but I'm either guessing maybe in the 40 to maybe 60 dollars for the cartridge this is just my assumption I have not seen it priced anywhere I have not even seen this in the local dispensary near me so if you guys want to give me a better understanding of what the prices are if you've seen this before you can let me know in the comments below but like if I had to guess it's probably going to be up there in terms of like plug-and-play orchid essentials it's just a really neat hole around looking pen you know I'm gonna hit it one more time for you guys I'm probably gonna end the video here check out chill I'll post their [ __ ] on the screen not too sure if I'm a post in the description because you know all that YouTube [ __ ] delete my account for selling and linking things so we're just going to be extra careful but one more hit you're probably gonna call it video yes oof tastes like [ __ ] my fruit candy but yes that's going to be it for the video hopefully you guys enjoyed it I will see you guys in the next one [Music] [Music] [Music]", "YynoXbI3O8g": "[Music] howdy folks welcome to wheats it has been a couple of months for me since I've done this so you excuse me if I'm a little rusty but we are back here and we are talking cartridges one that you guys have really been riding me hard about and that is raw garden we are finally taking a look at a raw garden there I'll try to actually get it in focus this is their SAP very OG in sativa hybrid with eighty six point two one percent THC and you can see the lab testing results there on the back everything you want to see right off the bat I actually really kind of admire this austere packaging there isn't much to it you're not wasting a whole lot and you're not sort of screwing up the environment by you know the super ornate packaging so III dig that fact and this cartridge it's a half gram cartridge and it cost me thirty bucks at a dispensary a legal licensed shop here in Long Beach California and this is a live resin cartridge which means that I believe it is just the distilled flower itself out says right here 100% whole cannabis flower oil 100% cannabis terpenes so no additives just refined cannabis not cut with anything no thinning agents nothing to make it less viscous none of that just just the good stuff so for 35 for 30 dollars rather for actual live resin cartridge is a pretty good deal uh so I will endeavour to open it here which I'm struggling at surprisingly perhaps not surprisingly boy this uh sticker makes it quite difficult to rip open as you can see ah there we go so you know well I take back all the nice stuff I said about the packaging because that was a pain in the ass but still just a small small discretion okay so here we go we have um like a childproof container there I've never seen a cartridge with these push down and turn this is just like an aspirin bottle I was really nervous that I was gonna [ __ ] this up but I did it I did it I'm just as proud of me as you guys are so here we go here is our cartridge traditional half gram looks like we've got some kind of very nice plastic herb some kind of material it almost looks like ceramic or feels like ceramic tip there I've had this quality before it's great I didn't generally don't like the plastic sort of tips but whatever material this is is very solid and doesn't give you that sort of gross mouthfeel which is a gross word in and of itself so a pretty standard 510 thread there oil looks great a very very golden yellow beautiful looking oil and we'll go ahead and attach it to my trusty 510 here this is the brass knuckles 900 milliamp battery it's been treating me quite well so now we will do the big thing the thing that you guys all came here for and that's the test so let's go ahead and take a draw here [Music] I don't know why I didn't see the vapor I certainly tasted it let me get one more and see if I can get a bigger sort of cloud for you guys [Music] whoa there we go and this is a taster guys I have never had SAP berry OG before but I think I like the taste Wow kind of fruity little yes citrusy almost very sort of refreshing almost kind of tasty apparently different than a lot of strains that I've had in terms of flavor profile which makes sense because it is as they say a hundred percent terpenes there's no flavor additives here it's just the terpenes from the weed itself so I guess it would make sense that it's super flavorful but I really dig um in terms of draws super easy no resistance was having no problem there and does not burn hot doesn't I'm you guys all know I have baby lungs no problem there barely felt it and barely felt it in the lungs really smooth consistent kind of hit let me get another one in here oh boy that is delightful actually and not only does it taste great but this [ __ ] is strong as [ __ ] um I've been on a bit of a tolerance break recently so I know my opinions gonna be a little bit higher than one that's it no pun intended but this is every bit as strong as they suggest which was what 86% I do not doubt it it feels every bit that 86% a nice clean head high I feeling giggly actually right now boy this could not have gone better you guys know your [ __ ] because I absolutely love this and as it for right now big thumbs up but but as you guys all know for my cartridge reviews I like to review the whole thing not just these first couple of drags here so I'm gonna enjoy this very much over the next couple of days and as soon as I'm finished I will come back right here with you guys and let you know all my wrap-up thoughts because as we all know these cartridges are not bulletproof they're they are prone to problems so I'll be sure to let you know if anything happens but you know I'm really excited about this one so guys that's gonna do it for this first half of this review thank you so much for watching and I'll see all you find folks right back here in a bit ciao [Music] hi guys welcome back to weeds it has been about two and a half days since I checked in with you talking raw Gardens there live resident carte SAP Barry oh and guys I am happy to tell you this one Rockets right to the very top of my favorite cards list this is a mercury I loved every little second of this I loved the taste I never got harsh tasted beautiful threw out every last drop in there is gone both because I wanted every drop to be gone and it was easy to extract it all um as I said one of the best tasting cards I've ever had and in terms of the high itself guffy quite high higher than most cards do I take I got up to a 7 after I maybe three or four good inhales and um the dye itself was actually almost kind of giggly in a way I really was euphoric it was a different kind of high but a very good one um one that I absolutely enjoyed and guys I am thrilled with raw garden I love that you guys suggested it this is gonna be one of my go-to cards just for personal use at 30 bucks amazing deal rock garden super super big thumbs up for me at this point looking forward to trying some more of their products so guys before I go here I'm gonna share with you a little cherry on top something you can enjoy throughout your week I've let that dog kind of go she'll do her own thing well maybe where you going dog alright well we got that dog now so uh cherry on top I want to share with you guys something that's a little bit basic [ __ ] I guess for me but something that I love doing my wife and I have a tradition every year where we watch a season of Survivor at like 20 year old CBS show we'll stick it on usually around Christmas time and we'll put it on Amazon Prime they have a bunch of seasons we look up which seasons are the best and we'll watch one a year it's a great tradition and if you haven't watched survivor since 1999 and you haven't watched any reality TV shows like I have since then you don't give it a shot there's a reason it's been around for 20 years it's a hell of a lot of fun even if it is you know on CBS well guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top and then that's gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching as always and we will see all of you fine folks right back here on the next review I gotta get walking through these dogs are gonna get killing me come on guys [Music]", "BMSzf_bzJ14": "and how's everyone doing today we're gonna be doing a cart review and this one I'm actually quite excited for it because I bought this just yesterday its indica Skywalker the eureka cart these ones are really high in potency and this is coming in that THC level eighty-seven point fifty-two percent THC mg at 875 points to mg CBD point twenty six and more CBD mg coming in at a whopping two point six feet before this vapor cartridge now we're gonna be unboxing it so it is but put some close-ups on the screen for you guys I love the box here because it actually is a really nice box I don't think you just will end up to the camera really does it justice so exactly a sense of what you hope you guys enjoy this for other people we just had you orgasm you I really do you don't really digging this packaging Buddhist oh my god its packaging you don't really get that you must get them in a vial or something this is how they normally are open so foggy we are going to a he's faking his reviews these things come like this artisan so this is the cartridge here it is a clear oil as you guys can see it clearly obviously explained the title of the video yeah it's real cart we're gonna try to get on this booze penny at really trying it at three point three votes if you guys can see that they're hittin this bad boy alright alright its baby boy hopefully you guys were big along with me and it's can to hit in this car [Music] [Music] first impression all right first impressions of this really good this is a really nice strong pool I like it it's a it's a really nice pool body's pretty thick I like that adds a really pungent and same taste to it this guy Walker by the way but now already mentioned that already but um yeah okay well after those two shitty ghosts um I like said this oil is pretty freakin dank it is pretty freakin fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or something it's not like an instant high like how you get with these fake cards out here that just have other stuff in it unknown stuff by the way I would just like to mention that just makes the effect of the hike um so much quicker than when it's actually supposed to you know but this one feels like I'm smoking like a blunt and it just comes steady and steady and steady and then it just hits me in the face when I'm just too baked and I'm really baked right now so hopefully you guys did enjoy this video leave a like comment and tell me how you guys are doing on this quarantine and yeah it's been your boy visa", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "Q5xorweaNTU": "So you want to add terpenes to your THC\nproduct. Well how much terpenes do you use? That's called the dilution ratio. My name is Drew, owner of MrExtractor.com, and\nI'm here today to tell you the truth about what dilution ratio you should be\nusing in this week's episode: \"Terpene Dilution Ratios\" from The Terpene\nInstitute. So you want to start mixing terpenes in your product, and you don't\nknow how much to use, and your products are expensive, and you don't want to mess\nit up. I totally got that, all right. So what I'm gonna do, is there's a whole\nbunch of different products that you can mix terpenes with, and I want to do a\nvideo on every single one. I'm gonna give you a tutorial, whether you already make\nproducts, or you're just thinking about it, on how to make every single different\nproduct with our terpenes. But the fact is, I just don't have time right now. So\nI'm gonna give you a basic understanding on how much you should use with all\ndifferent products. And I'll skim through it, and hopefully this gets you going, and\nlater you can watch a full tutorial on each individual product. I'll just give\nyou a walk down on how to make it. Make it, sell it, knock yourself out, alright? So\none of the main things that people are doing right now is they're taking our\nterpenes and they're mixing them with distillate and they're making a vapor\npen. So how much do you want to use? Now, always, every batch of distillate is\ngonna be different. And all terpenes are a little bit different, but they're all\npretty much the same. So I tell everybody; no matter how professional you are, no\nmatter how big you are, no matter how small you are, you always want to do a\nsmall batch first. If you have a thousand grams of distillate, and a big jar\nterpenes, don't just mix the two together because if you blow it, then you're\nscrewed. Start with the 1 gram batch. Get your\nratio- I do that on every product I ever make and so do large companies. Small\nbatch testing, that's the term for it. So what I recommend is that, well first off,\nyou need to understand that the ratio between terpenes and your product is\ngoing to differ every single time, because your distillate will always come\nout a different viscosity and it depends on what pen you use every different pen\nand cartridge that you use has different hole sizes in there and burns\ndifferently if it likes specific viscosity that it works best at\nknow your cartridge first and make a few different samples and see which one\nactually tastes best and smokes with the biggest clouds in the cartridge that\nyou're using and then don't switch because you're gonna have to do it all\nover every single time so basically with distillate you want to start out at 10%\nof terpenes no you take your distillate say you got 100 grams of tur picking a\nhundred grams of distillate 10 grams of terpenes now you're gonna want to mix\nthat heat does help the smallest amount of heat quickly mix it and make sure it\nemulsifies all together now if you heat something at a low temperature for a\nlong time at darkens I've personally found that if I heat it high really\nquickly and stir it and then cool it down I have less darkening because it's\nreally like a baking effect in my opinion high heat doesn't always like\ninstantly flash it everyone's got a different opinion on it so whatever you\ndo you have to heat it up a little bit make sure that it emulsifies in and take\nthe heat away from it and then you want to let it cool down to room temperature\nbecause your client is gonna be using that pen at room temperature you want to\nput it in the pen while it's still warm check your pen at room temperature not\nhot see how the bubble moves see how it smokes and if I were you I'd make a\ncouple different pens at different rates and find out what works best for your\npen like I said it's gonna be different there's a million types of pens out\nthere you may live in Arizona where everything's 100 degrees you may live in\nAlaska you're gonna want to make it a little runny or in Alaska and a little\nthicker in Arizona so all custom work here so you've mixed in 10% this works\ngreat it's probably not gonna be too runny I could pretty much guarantee that\nbut if it's too thick still then you can just add a little bit more terpenes and\nstir it in being that the terpenes have already emulsified in your distillate\nyou don't need to reheat it at that point it will mix in just by hand just\nfine now if you've made it to a thin add more\ndistillate in there stir it back up until you've got it the right way you'll\nnever really ruin a batch if you're doing that ballpark ratios for\ndistillate 10 to 15% is what we recommend now like I said we work out of\nLos Angeles we supply some of the largest pen companies in the country\ndown in Los Angeles and we always talk with their R&D teams what they're\nfinding is you can get the amount of terpenes to make it function in the pen\nbut customers are actually just getting more flavor they you know they\njust really want to taste some things and that's what we're just seeing across\nthe board always work with what your clients want because that's your main\ngoal not what you want nobody really cares what you like just remember that\nyou got to keep it in perspective you may be the owner of a company nobody\ncares customers want what they want so make sure to give them choices and let\nthem choose you know it's one of the fallacies that we all have as\nmanufacturers that everybody thinks like us so give them a few options let them\nchoose if they want a more flavorful pen or a less flavorful pen cannabis\nprofiles flavor profiles whatever remember 10 to 15% is a ballpark in Los\nAngeles in the major areas we are finding that they like a little bit more\nterpenes for a more robust flavor in their pen thistle it tastes like crap\nanyway I think it tastes like plastic and I don't like the taste of it I'd\nrather have a little more flavoring a little weaker pen and take an extra hit\nof something I liked then one less hit of something that I don't now when\nyou're dealing with shatter and hard extracts you have to remember there's a\nwindow here the scale you've got liquefied oil down here you've got solid\nshatter over here you are taking either end of this spectrum and you're trying\nto get it into a liquid obviously this oil over here is closer\nto a liquid already so all you have to do is add a little bit of terpenes if\nyou're over here in a solid state you're gonna have to add more terpenes so on\nthe hardest shatter we've ever seen just like some glass the most we've ever had\nto add was 50% by weight cool thing about my products which makes them\nbetter than other people's products as other companies give you a max dilution\nratio of 5 to 8% because they do not know how to blend their terpenes watch\nmy other videos on how to blend terpenes and why our products are better\nscientifically our products will taste fine at 50% you try doing that with\nanother company your throats going to get all jacked up because they don't\nknow how to do it they're just reading a piece of paper from a lab we don't do\nthat we handcraft our blends so that regardless of what product you're using\nit's gonna taste good and it's gonna taste the same and it's not gonna be\nharsh so for BHO some solid shatter you're gonna want to use a up to a 50%\nratio we can pretty much guarantee that all of our products will taste good up\nto a 50% ratio and it's kind of unheard of other companies require the use of\nMCTS or polyethylene glycol as a cutting agent I don't like it it's not how we\ndeveloped our product so one gram of BHO shatter 2\nthe half a gram now our terpenes are about 48 drops per gram so if you don't\nhave a scale and you have a gram of shattered what does that 24 drops will\nliquify that down so what about wax isn't crumble well that's just in the\nmiddle of the scale so you know you've got 10% over here 50% over here you\nwaxing your crumbles are going to be at about 25 to 30% those things usually\ncome out fogging when you stir them up if you have an extract and you mix them\nterpenes and it's kind of foggy hit it with a little heat those are your waxes\nthat are showing the waxes loosen up they melt and then they emulsify\nthemselves back in there and then it stays clear it's a really cool process\nso what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do demo videos on each one of these I'm\ngoing to take some distillate I'm gonna mix it I'm going to show you the\ndifferences in everything I'm gonna take some BHO it makes it teach you how to do\nall that and another time right now I've just got a lot on my plate so hopefully\nthese basic ratios help you out in your products and go try it out start with a\nsmall batch always make sure it functions at room temperature always\nscale yourself up there's companies out there making millions of dollars that\nstarted in their garage and so can you alright so thanks for watching the\nterpene Institute was created just to give you a simple common-sense\nunderstanding of terpenes and the cannabis industry make some money help\nsome people trying to help you guys out alright thank you for watching go to mr.\nextract or calm I will see you in the next episode take it easy", "I9babjQA-aM": "whether you got an exotic car or a tank art I'm going to show you how to get the oil up so this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got an exciting one for you today all right so a lot of you have asked me how can I get the oil out of my broken cartridge well if you've got an exotic card or a dead bank card or one of the many other cartridges that use this style of vaporizer cartridge I'm going to show you how to get the oil out of it first things first let's take it to the deck and introduce you to what we'll be working with all right so here we are first things first let me go over the utensils that we will be working with today this is a stand that I made myself to hold cartridges in while I filled in these are a couple of varieties of syringe that are available this particular style right here works adequately for filling and emptying most cartridges that you get on the market today specifically 1/2 gram cartridges and 1 gram cartridges this will generally empty most of those now this tip is a little short and as such I'm showing a few of the available sizes this is approximately 1/2 inch one inch and a one and a half inch tips right here in varying diameters for filling no next to it I have a 1/2 gram or 0.5 milliliter and a 1 gram or a 1 milliliter cartridge these are one-time use non reusable disposable cartridges these are also 0.5 milliliter or 1/2 gram and one milliliter or 1 gram these are refillable and reusable the mouthpiece screws off where these are a press fit and they have to be forcibly removed now these are the two styles that I recommend when you are replacing the oil into another cartridge as you will see the exotic cards uses a slightly different cartridge right there but I prefer when I'm refilling to go with a tried-and-true cartridge to ensure the failure does not happen again with that in mind the first thing we're going to look at is these tips now as you can see this is a one and a half inch tip right here this is an half inch tip right here no this is a half milliliter or 1/2 gram cartridge as you can see this tip would work adequately to recover just about all the oil in that cartridge very well in the 1 gram cartridge as you can see you would be able to recover most of the oil except for what is stuck around the chimney right there for that a longer syringe such as this is a much more adequate okay now that I've shown you a couple of the utensils let's get these cartridges open real quick and we can see what they look like all right here we are so this is a lemon berry Gang babes cartridge with a C cell with a pronounced THC of 90.9 9% here's a little bit of a close-up if you'd like to pause that to get a little bit of the idea of the flavor then this is a C cell cartridge right here just like it states C cell right there this one right here this I believe is an eye crusher cartridge and this is some fruity pebbles from exotic cars this has the hologram I'm right there and this is a hybrid this one here says it's been 80 and 85 all right okay and here we are now please bear with me this may take a minute for some of these I have found that on some of these cartridges this perfectly round tip right here does not always work and I have modified one slightly so that it is slightly oblong to fit down around that chimney a little bit and that's what I want to be using right now to ensure that I'm able to reach cover as much oil as I can I'll be working with this first one this is a fruity pebbles from exotic karts I believe this is an eye crusher cartridge what we're gonna do we're going to start off with just removing the lid it just twists off just like that right there you can see set that to the side now I have a custom-made stand right here that I tend to use to hold my cartridges when I'm filling them if it tends to stay pretty pretty good right there right and you're going to take your syringe and just insert it and start drawing up right as you can sort of these have both been warmed up a little bit to ensure that they do flow decently I definitely recommend that as you can see you want to try to get as far down into that that edge right near that hole right there as you can get and then lean that the cartridge as far away as you can and just try to recover every little bit that you can and don't don't be afraid to suck a little bit of air up in there I mean you really want to you want to be able to try to recover everything that you can there for sure all right there's a little bit there what I recommend you do at that stage is just set it on the side and let it gather on one on one side real quick heat that up a little bit let all that oil gather on that opposite side and then you can stick this back in there and and utilize it that way well this is warm I'm gonna put this into another cartridge real quick just to ensure that it flows pretty good like I said then just put this tip right down in there this is able to go actually down in there like this to recover oil from one of these are necessary and then all right there you go sit that put Leon that and remember this let these sit for a few minutes that then oil bubble down in his holes and if it's good and warm like this one is it'll get down to those holes no problem alright and that's basically how you do that one as you can see on this there's a little bit gathering down on that edge we'll just gather that up as much as we can right there and uh this here just set it right off to the side with the cap there and uh that's basically garbage now with the dank veins it's a little bit of a different different different ballgame here you've got to remove this mouthpiece this mouthpiece is a press fit on here it does not just come off so what you're gonna need to do you're gonna need to grab this with a pair of vise grips or a comparable pair of pliers and there you go alright pull that mouthpiece right off of there now we take our syringe we insert our syringe all the way down and get just down there see how far that went in and then we slowly start to draw that all out of there all right we want to put the syringe on the bottom edge and start drawing there we go he's just taking all that oil right out of there all the way down until there's almost nothing left in there she'll be able to empty that thing out completely alright and there you go that's basically one done unit that point you can get comparable unit exactly basically the same unit brand-new these cartridges can all be purchased at vape art smart comm there is a link in the description you simply take that cartridge you take that syringe you put it right in there just like you four set it right down near that inside down there just like that there's a fill up in there all right and there you go put the lid on that get that near the old vise press that in and WHAM bulb Lambo there you go let's get this back on top and I'll tell you guys how this works out alright folks well here we are back on top with the new cartridges we got the fruity pebbles crammed down into this bad chicken right here this is a refillable csail cartridge available in the description below at Bay Park smart dog on go ahead give them a click and I'll go check that out the syringes that I use also available at Bay Park smart dog but go down there give up click on that link in the description and go check them out we've got the lemon berry from dad baby sitting here on another non refillable press-fit sea cell cartridge those are also available at vape arts marcom click that link in the description if you're interested in those all right well let's strap this on this old battery and see what see what she is Susie it's like Shelly all right yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about all right well there you go you guys have an absolutely wonderful they think is so much for to me and I started to appreciate it if you learned something and you enjoyed it but like on the old thumbs up down there make sure you share this so other people can also benefit from the knowledge and you have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with CMC connoisseurs peace", "w0_1bXksiUM": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up guys back here for another video and your boys back here with another freaking cart review slash versus guys i haven't tried these too strange in so long so your boy had to try him um the homie he picked up and he's just been you know collecting a lot of cars so you boy had to you know hop on and he let me try the bezel so shout out to the homie you already know see get yourself a homie who got cards that you can review you feel me and try out you feel me so we got the nug and the nug is a big sur it's a live resin and then the bezel it's actually called bezel i think i said bezel earlier it's actually called bezel it's a sauce cart and this one is actually i think higher in terpenes and stuff than this other cart and it's actually it's also um made using butane actually i read it on the side in their ingredients but it also says it's high in terpenes so we're going to check that out see how good it is it's a a disc chill it with terpenes basically turns it into sauce i guess but the other one is more of a live resin so sauce versus live resin you kill me but um let me give you guys a close-up this is uh what the bezel comes in like a tube comes in a pretty big box but they only sell uh half grams so if you guys are in the full grams you're probably gonna end up having to buy two they haven't made a full gram cartridge of this yet but you know what it's all good let me take a hit before i even open up this other package hope everyone's smoking right now i'm smoking on um the rest of the absolute extracts the orange creamsicle freaking fire we're going to turn this temp up i know y'all like seeing them clouds because y'all like seeing a brother cough i let a lot of that get away but y'all saw me but um as you can see it's hard to get these shits open with one hand but it's all good the bigger one is the nug it has their little symbol on if you can see it you can barely see it but as you can see the sauce cart it's a little lighter and that's just because it has distillates and the terpenes you know it's not enough to make it super dark but it makes it dark the terpenes i'm pretty sure is what makes it darker but it looks good it's a nice little i don't know what kind of i don't know but you know it's pretty much the same as nug it's just another is a little bit darker but they're both kind of an amberish color this one's more yellow though you know what i'm saying but um we're gonna try out the nut first just because i am a nug fan over basil so we're gonna try snug first shout out to nug if y'all haven't seen um i made a video on their dispensary so go check that out um and also i did a review on one of their freaking fire ass products called thc a if you guys haven't seen that i'll try and put it in the top of the screen but don't be mad if it's not the top of the screen just go through my vlogs check me out watch it man you guys will catch a [ __ ] vibe all right cheers guys enough time let's see if i can take a blinker hit we'll see it's on a very high temp right now so i don't know if i can bam what street big sur i don't know what [Music] what freaking strains they use flower wise but it definitely has like a um let me taste it one more time guys hold on i give you exact what i think in my brain what it tastes like i don't know i feel like it has like a little taste but it's not necessarily sweet but it's definitely just like super dank because it's not guys it's live resin you guys already know that but it tastes super smooth like it's not harsh really at all you already know it's freaking it's amazing like nuggets probably one of my top live resins that i would get and one day i'm gonna do like at the end of the year when it's a new year guys i'm thinking about showing you guys all my product so tell me if you guys want that vlog showing you all the products that i did um that i smoked this year and telling you guys which ones i thought were the top best ones because i feel like in some of my vlogs i don't necessarily you know tell you guys oh this is better or this one's better because some people like different things and i want people to try things you know think for yourself you feel me because i'm not an influencer guys i i'm just gonna put that out there right now i don't want to be called an influencer if anything the thing the message that i want you guys to get is to think on your [ __ ] selves you know but um shout out to you guys let me take over here before i try this sauce yeah that shit's a hit man that's just to hit you turn the temp down and try oh yeah let me turn the temp down and like maybe i could taste it better that's facts i forgot see this is the honey stick that i used to have guys you've seen it in um vlogs before but mine broke or got stolen one of those i can't remember but hey it's almost 10. it's a little tip and we're high as [ __ ] but um let's see what it tastes like on low temp because low temp guys this is what people need to understand like yes it's cool to have big clouds get that fat head get loaded as [ __ ] hella quick whatever but it's also cool to just gradually get high and take low temp hits because you actually get the flavor of the strain that you won't you know that you're smoking like that's why it would be dope to you know vaporize but you know it's just a lot of vaporizers that i want like the volcano are super expensive because i would honestly bake the bud get high you know and then use the vape bud to make edibles or something but we're gonna try it on low temp [Music] i don't know it don't almost taste like uh like a cake like plain by itself you know what i mean i don't know if you got like just you know like pound cake or something i don't that's just me you traced in i don't know you i don't know maybe i'm wrong it has something in there like a certain taste to it that i feel like but it is dank as [ __ ] mainly it's just like a super dang dab taste but it has a taste to it i feel like what do you think [Music] dude i could taste this sauce it almost tastes like like lemon cake see i'm saying it's like a i feel you it's like lemony or something bro i'm puffing on this right now and like it tastes sweet as [ __ ] take a puff on that the sauce tastes sweet as hell when you puff on it right now like don't you think holy [ __ ] like i think this might have this might win no no we ain't gonna say that yet we're gonna say that yet hold on let's switch it up [Music] and i'm not the biggest fan of these tops because like you can end up seeing the oil there but these tops because they're circle they're good for taking bong hits you know if you don't have like the tool to smoke your boners so cheers guys we're gonna taste this on low temp because it tasted super fruity like it had like flavor to it guys so we're gonna see what it tastes like [Music] damn bro [Music] this [ __ ] is good guys holy [ __ ] i'm trying to match the flavor on this [ __ ] bro it's like um like a like i see like i don't know [Music] it's like a sherbert you guys can barely see the vapor probably because it's on low temp but it tastes like freaking sherbet or something taste it real quick tell me i'm telling you bro flavorful papaya papaya okay papaya what which one is this dude this is the the miss usa this is miss usa guys sorry i did not say in the vlog you guys probably can't see that but it says miss usa and it's an indica hybrid slash hybrid so it's a hybrid probably dominant indica or indica dominant you turned up 10 a little bit [Music] all right guys this this bezel is is giving nug a run for their money not not trying to dis nug but you have to see it like this guys the bezel is a distillate that's high in terpenes nug is a live resin so it's not a fair comparison because they don't add anything you're not you don't really add anything to librarian some brands do like um i'm trying to think like buddies they add terpenes to their live resins but um i don't think nug adds any terpenes to their live resin i'ma look at the ingredients [Music] they might have terps in it but it's like maybe low in it low in terps but um this freaking diesel actually tastes freaking fire you gotta try this strain exactly guys miss usa try this straight exactly i'm gonna take um a couple more hits for you guys and i'm gonna dip out and just chill you know gotta chill a little bit you know you know spend time with homie talk a little bit and you know maybe have some high moments some high thoughts guys tell me if you guys want to hear our high thoughts video comment below if you guys want to see a video about just my high thoughts or some [ __ ] we've been like me and the homie been thinking about it so maybe we'll just jot some things down that we said because we say some like crazy freaking [ __ ] that's just like what the hell high thoughts guys like i thought but let me take a rip real quick [Music] damn yeah this cart i'm buying this car soon i'm buying this car

another review video make sure you like subscribe and watch to the end for a chance to win a free prize also check out my website that be dead without Ohio canvass live.com enjoy the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "6-qXy-MVgh8": "[Music] so [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another bear laps cartridge video you know saying we got the gorilla glue 4 i actually went to the club thinking i was able to get another lemon sorbet but it sold out quick and i was just kind of like sitting there thinking about what cartridges again i was just like well let me just try another gorilla glue but i was kind of like iffy about that because if you didn't see my video already with the other bear labs video that i did randy got the strawberry cheesecake and it wasn't that great it wasn't it was a cartridge that i probably wouldn't even buy so it kind of was just like oh there's like a 50 50 chance that this might be bad as well so i don't know i got it anyways we're gonna see but i did get some boba as well so let's just [Applause] yup mango peached green tea so this is my old lemon sorbet one just pop that out put that right here let's just open this so uh let's see what this is running at did i even tell you the box didn't even see what percentage i think it did last time but here it is one gram that's weird let's try this though so i mean even though it says live resin cartridges i believe it's they use the same method as royal garden because it's very light or the same method as buddies i don't know what exactly they do but [ __ ] it let's crack this open and let's just see oh wait there's some sort of uh wrapping on here some keys for this but yeah hopefully you guys have been enjoying the content and let me know if you've tried bear labs i've only tried two bear labs cartridges and only one of them was good i'm not saying the strawberry cheesecake one was bad but it definitely was not good [Music] so [Music] let's try this this was 32 out the door so definitely not bad i'm not bad at all all right cheers why was it clogged already i'm thinking when it's clogged i think maybe they transport it in a little bit of a warm temperature and maybe it clogged it i don't have no idea but cheers boys not bad a very lemony zesty type of taste but definitely not bad uh i was dreading that it tastes disgusting or at least not not tasty at all but this is very good i would say it's a very minimal tasting lemony one uh kind of like the lemon sorbet but it has its own gorilla glue you know like that piney-ness i'm gonna take another hit though [Music] [Music] it's definitely a hitter holy [ __ ] oh gorilla glue 4 strong sativa hybrid oh it's a bit weird that they didn't have the the can uh cannabinoids or or the yeah i think the last ones i had they had the cannabinoids in the front right here i could be wrong honestly my memory's not as good but definitely not a bad cartridge for 32 i could definitely see myself getting this again and i'm going to take one more hit because why the [ __ ] not it's gorilla glue it's around three it's around 3 p.m right now and what better way or what better time to smoke gorilla glue right then right now you know so cheers i'm about to meet up with the homie be legit maybe do a video after i don't know but cheers wow might even try the other ones because they had because they had a triangle mints but i remember stevie saying that it wasn't that good because he had the wax form i might try it um but they only had three i believe they only had three raw uh i mean i believe they only had four strains when it came to bear labs cartridges triangle mints lemon sorbet strawberry cheesecake and then gorilla glue four so i've already tried three out of the four and triangle mints i might try but like i said my homie stevie tried the wax version and i remember him saying that it was it might have been something else but i'm sure i mean triangle mints is a very strange name something that you probably that would stick out right and uh i just remember him saying that it wasn't as good but i could be wrong so i might try it in the future other than that uh very very good cartridge 32 bucks not bad at all not bad at all i'm gonna take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here cheers oh look how much i hit it all right guys that's gonna be it for the video peace out [Music] uh you", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on

for you today so if you keep up with my channel you'll know that I review a few different cartridges well in the last week I planned on going hiking so I picked up a couple that seemed to be good quality I picked up a pure which is premium ultra refined extractions limoncello alright this butane processed 89 percent for a total of 90 so it's a 90 percent THC cartridge or you know basically alright it's all it says and I also picked up a brand that I'm really happy with this is a Jack Herer this was a sativa from canna clouds hashtag kin of clouds 502 and this one here ninety one point seven percent THC or cannabinoids with the THC of 83 and TCA of 7.5 worked it out that's good cuz point twos right there alright this is persue stand produced and processed by eh farms this was done by eh o alcohol solomon extraction okay so we've got these two different oils we've got a butane processed oil we've got an alcohol processed oil both of them seem to be good there's one ever the other difference this cartridge right here is produced by C cell this is an M 528 Jupiter okay now this came from the can of clouds very nice this particular cartridge here this came from the pier this one as you can clearly see is an AV D cartridge I think we can see the model number underneath it looking at AV d 0 6 to 9 RP 1-800 - okay now well I was hiking I was utilizing both of these cartridges as they have different flavors and different effects and I was enjoying them immensely however I noticed before too long that my AVD cartridge which you can see right here this actually has a little bit of oil on the end right there and see it's actually caked all the way around the base of it here no for comparison we can get the C cell right here no oil in any of the pores the draw ports very clean very nice no you may think that this one was used quite a bit more than this one and therefore that may have been the cause that's not true I was utilizing them both through this vape mod battery it has a very simple magnetic connector you screw onto your 510 thread cartridge it is draw activated works very nice big clouds battery stays good most of the day not to worry now this cartridge which is only my second AVD cartridge that i've gotten recently has started to leak this of course is a C cell cartridge if you watch my videos you will know that I get C cells regularly for an example there are some of my cartridges from the recent days this is my only other AVD as you can see something is inside that cartridge I don't know if that was done when it was filling by the processor or if that was something left in there in the construction of the cartridge I'm not sure but this is my only other AVD I decided not to utilize this because that is an unknown factor it could either be from the processor or from the manufacturer but that being said these are all C cell cartridges they all work exceptionally well see cell C so C cell C so C so so that being said a VD I'm afraid I'm gonna have to buy another one and see if it does the same thing I am very happy with the quality of the can of clouds cartridges there were no massive temperature differences maybe 2025 degrees they were not sitting in the Sun at any point in time nor sitting in a freezing area this is something that does happen and it does occur so shop around a little bit watch some more of my videos and don't just watch my channel watch some other channels to see what they have to say about different cartridges that they've had experiences with because not all these companies are available in all the states that being said this is John with C&C connoisseurs you guys have a good day and I look forward to seeing you again peace", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys

"FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "HE1ok2hM8ak": "hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm gonna talk to you about how to choose the best wax dab concentrates pen for you based on your awesome feedback and all the great emails that we got from our guide on how to pick the perfect concealer it's only fitting that we give you a rundown on how to pick out your best wax pen so I'm gonna walk you through a lot of the things that I say to my clients when I help them pick out the best wax pen in my line of work I work with a lot of extractors growers of cannabis a lot of big customers and part of my job aside from being the CEO here is playing vape matchmaker with a lot of people and it's something I truly enjoy doing and fitting them with the perfect vaporizer and that's what I'm gonna try to extend to you guys today so when I get a big customer that figures they want to you know start buying wax pens or whatnot or concentrates pen I like to ask them a few questions the first question that I ask them is what are you looking for are you looking for Foreman function concealability are you looking for something on the go and generally based on how they answer that first question you know I will direct them towards a certain vaporizer and then the next question I ask them which is probably the most important question is what's more important to you is it the flavor that you get off of the concentrates or are you more of an intensity person to where you like the volume of the hit the the amount of fills with the heat up time so let's run through our devices and see how they fit in those categories so we can let you pick your perfect honey stick wax and that vaporizer so let's say that you like things you're on the go you like things that are stealth you want to be very discreet about what you do but you don't want to sacrifice the big box perform which comes with every one of our honey sticks by the way so to start off our least expensive wax and dab pen is the rippin ditch and I mean this thing every major delivery service in California is carrying this so many dispensaries do because it is a disposable wax pen which means that you use it and when the battery runs out then you can just throw it away I love it because it's super convenient because even you know I deal with vaporizers all days so when it comes to you know handling your vapes I don't want to have to clean it or maintain it I just want to use it for a while it's there and then I want to toss it so this unit you get about 200 puffs off of off of one charge and then you would throw it away it has a push button operation which you could tell you pushes their lights up to the end the little leaf and also it has a five-click lock like most vaporizers it still has big power and good taste because it has a ceramic bowl and a quartz atomizer so you're still going to get good flavor and you're gonna get good intensity and because of this battery you're still going to get a decent heat up time it's very convenient for you especially if you're traveling and you don't want to fly around with a vaporizer that could possibly have medical residues on it so you just take these bad boys with you on your trip you vape them while you're there when they run out you throw them well you don't have to worry about getting your precious pen confiscated or getting yourself into any trouble or having any hassles there to be safe than sorry very convenient very very price conscious so if you're an on-the-go guy doesn't want to deal with maintaining and cleaning your vaporizer you know or your your traveling this is definitely a good pen for you and you're still get good taste and good intensity off of it next up in our concealer ring is not something that we sell is a kit but a lot of people a lot of our customers have actually figured this out they've enlightened us to it is they purchase the replacement wax a dab tank from the phantom and pair it with our awesome minimax battery and when you pair these two things it turns into an extremely small extremely light little vape pen that you can attach to your keychain very concealable there's no window on this thing it's all stainless steel here so you're not going to get anything that spews out and it has a dual chords rod and ceramic bowl let me just show you and it heats up very fast because our minimax is a very powerful little battery this thing is so light and you're still gonna get good heat up times and really good flavor but again these two units aren't so robust they don't have a very large bowl so if you're one of those people who really wants to you know tack up a vaporizer and then take it out and not have to worry about filling it back up you probably want to go with a bigger unit these are more for on-the-go very convenience very concealed oriented since we're already talking about phantom cartridge and minimax you can just go into our phantom which is already a 2 in 1 which everything is completely concealed it has a thousand mAh high-capacity battery everything is completely protected you can just fit it right into your pocket you simply excavate the magnet adapter and just like I showed you you have your dual quartz and ceramic atomizer there which is gonna give you fast heat up times good intensity and not sacrifice on your taste because you can see again like I just explained the bowl isn't that big so if you're one of those guys that wants to pack it up and go out for the evening you know you might want to get a larger unit so that's that's pretty much the convenience side and those are the certain price points let's say that you want something with a little bit more power a little bit you know more robust so what are you going to go now I say do you have your flavor preference or do you have your intensity preference so if you're a flavor guy and you absolutely you know just want to taste terpenes and your high-end concentrates you cannot go wrong with our stinger the Stinger is a ceramic doughnut atomizer unit which has three different temperature settings on the battery which you can alternate through by clicking it three times you get different colors knit is powered by a ceramic doughnut atomizer it's it's not a large bowl but it is pretty deep so you can pack it and a ceramic unit the downfall of a ceramic unit is that it takes a little bit extra heat up time even on the most intense ace an intense setting as opposed to the court so with the donut you're gonna push and hold and this is something I tell people is you're gonna push and hold the button down when it's packed and you should count one Mississippi two Mississippi and then start your inhale because it does take that extra two seconds to heat up and it doesn't get as hot in total temperature like the quartz units do part of that reason it's like slow cooking a steak is you're gonna get much better flavor you're not gonna overcook your concentrates and you're gonna what you lack in intensity and overall density of your vapor you're gonna make up for taste on your palate you know so this is really a flavor chasers unit for concentrates it also has a very big button it's very good for delivery so let's say that you know you're more of an intensity guy but you don't want to sacrifice on flavor either so what we have is we have our cannabis cup and we entered this into the cannabis cup and the people that we partnered up with they made a sauce you know a high terpene sauce and also a high terpene extract crumbles and it's more for solids because this unit paired with our hybrid tank it heats up very quickly it still has a ceramic ball it has these very wide quartz rods dual quartz rods so it's gonna heat up very quickly and it's actually gonna let the gas pressures build up in here so it's really gonna concentrate and give you an intensity it does have a ceramic bowl so it's not gonna have the flavor but it is gonna heat it so it's gonna have you know it's not gonna sacrifice your flavor but those quartz rods heat up extremely quickly especially if you use our battery on the most intense of its three heat settings so you get a very large hit and people who really enjoy power and a vaporizer and heat up time but don't want to sacrifice on taste are gonna love this vaporizer you know this kind of brings you the best of both worlds but intensity wise it really does take a step up from the ceramic doughnut I don't think that it's gonna give you all the intricate flavors that you can with the slow heat up time but it does come close but it's definitely gonna make up for in vapor volume we have these now coming with glass as well as plastic bodies so you don't have to worry about you know it breaking if you fall if it falls down or it being in your pocket our early hybrids had glass and a lot of people who had them on the go and broke them so now you have that option as well so this is gonna be protected and lastly what if you're like oh man you just presented those two vaporizers to me and I really can't decide which one I want because they both sound great which they are and you can buy them both with our discount code but if you just want one vaporizer we have a little unit called the aficionado which is one of the best-kept dab secrets on the market and what this thing has is it says it's for the people who can't decide is it's got a very small sleek fully concealed battery very light very easily transportable it has four different temperature settings in the vaporizer it even has an industry revolutionising the only one on the market iPhone rapid charger so you could plug your iPhone cable in there and from dead get a full charge in 15 minutes so it's perfect for on the go it comes with two heaters it comes with a ceramic plate which is very similar to the doughnut and it has a wide bore mouthpiece here and in the kit it also comes with a hookah mouthpiece and very nice large quartz rod double quartz rod ceramic bowl heaters for when you want the intent to turn dial up the intensity now again this battery does have four temperature settings on it so what you can do with it is you can really go from mild to wild with the push of three clicks when the units on to cycle through your temperature readings it has a honey stick insignia there and it really has a very high quality hand lathe feel so it's really one of those units where you have to you have to really feel it in your hands to really understand its true value but it does bring you the best of both worlds in one kit so thank you very much guys for tuning in I hope that this video will help you make your decision on how to pick out your best dab pen please do check us out on

know what i'm saying so i was really a fan of the lemon sorbet so all right we are gonna try this so very much very light what i've noticed is with that light lighter stuff it might have uh terpenes mixed in with it instead of reintroduced i mean instead of uh already being in there [ __ ] wait what is it that you just don't know uh when i when it's lighter i feel like they add turkeys but when it's darker they don't really add much children to it or if not any but that's just an assumption i don't really know but he's going to be opening the strawberry cheesecake and we're just going to take some ribs off this i don't have my battery on me you guys and my bad and maybe we shouldn't just meet get out the car we'll just use this battery let's trade them off oh yeah that tastes like the [ __ ] lemon sorbet oh wow refreshing hits that's like super lemony like if you haven't seen my lemon sorbet video it's exactly the same way it tastes like a lemon slushie oh my god that [ __ ] this is the [ __ ] that this was 32 buck that 27 [ __ ] even though it's still it's all right the cartridge itself is good [Laughter] damn bear labs you guys go check them out that's the damn seatbelt is

like they're both gonna taste hell again if this one doesn't taste good we got a [ __ ] problem i didn't just say it doesn't work uh yeah there's something wrong with this car it tastes like [ __ ] it says strawberry cheesecake but it tastes like [ __ ] let's try strawberry cheese [ __ ] or what strawberry cheese [ __ ] all right cheers guys i'm excited 32 for bear labs i kind of want to just go back and buy like two more but i'll reserve myself because that's not the way what's the way that no it moderation taste like strawberry i don't know but not even the wires came out right there i think that was broken well did it taste like strawberry cheesecake i didn't even taste it it tastes flavorless to me i need to try it again i'm bad y'all need to try to slightly like a little bit in the beginning but not really huh yeah damn i always get stuck with one of them [Music] turn again try it again i should have got me uh the other one that they had the gg4 or some [ __ ] i don't know do you think the gg4 would have been good that's crazy this is strawberry cheesecake you would think it would taste like strawberries no something you know we shouldn't taste like the name sometimes or sometimes it does happen you know i don't know i don't know i mean it doesn't taste bad but it didn't taste this good no they're not it's not bad yeah that's not bad i've had worse doesn't taste like that limited sorbet but it definitely hit so i'll tell you that right now thank you uh but yeah that's uh it for the video uh i'm really excited that we did get to try uh bear labs the cartridge but i'm a little bit disappointed that randy didn't get one as good as mine um but at the end of the day he can just use that one first and then he has that other uh the other jetties one that's way better than that one so yeah yeah but it's only 32. you know well it's not like you're paying 40. that's what happens when you're not moderate [Applause] yeah see he was actually going in there not trying to buy a cartridge he was just gonna buy wax and then i saw this beauty i thought that was beautiful it was all right it's not bad it could have been worse yeah but whatever strawberries okay and we also got uh i got a bad fish so expect the video on that um you got anything to say to the people before we end it hope you guys enjoy the video man continue like i said to support the homie and stay safe out there you guys cover 19 is still a thing uh let us know what you thought in the comment section below man and also yeah have a good day peace out [Music] you", "zZt4m-I8gZo": "if you want a canvas patient or of age please back off with this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be smoking this crescendo true leaf cart that they sent me so i forgot the exact type of cartridge that it is but i'm gonna have a picture of it and you guys will know what it is but is it open and i'm pretty sure it's a cured uh resin that's what it is so it's gonna have more of like a greeny taste is what they say so it's gonna taste more like the actual flour so since it's gonna be more like a resin i'm going to change the temperature oh it's actually on the coldest temperature right now so we're going to head on this on this toki 510 thread battery so here is the cartridge itself um the battery i guess and let me show you the cartridge this isn't the box it came in but this is the tube it came in because they have new boxes now so there was no point of me taking out the old box but yeah the cartridges are pretty much the same so let's go ahead and take a hit and let's see we could do as you guys can see i did change the background or i changed you know where i usually record my videos just because i want to change it up a little bit so you guys aren't always getting the same type of content and same area so let's go ahead and try something different [Music] so as you guys can see i've been getting a lot better at my ghosts and they're a lot easier in the car because there's no wind or anything moving but yeah the flavor's good it does have a green taste like they say i already smoked a lot of it so i already know how it tastes but it is true to what they say it does taste like it should let's go ahead and take another so this is a half gram see i'm just going to take a look around the cartridge so you guys can go ahead and look at the oil if you want i don't know if i'm too close so i'm gonna move back just a tad it's hopefully everything does look good that was a baby head and it still looked pretty nice i feel like you guys may want me to hit a blinker i usually don't hit blinkers on live resins or live yeah i guess cured live resins just because they're a little bit harsher on the throat and it's more of like it's hard to handle i guess pretty much i'll try i'll try to do it [Music] to be honest i didn't do it but i know this thing has like a seven second counter i was about one second away but there's no point in [ __ ] myself up for that i would have just coughed it all out and i wouldn't even have you know a decent head it would have just been a waste so i would rather just use that or stopped it there instead of wasting the hat because this stuff isn't cheap but uh thank you guys so much for watching this is ethan oh actually no make sure you guys subscribe come and leave a like because it really does help out the

"LZoRacclv2g": "hello world I'm a legal medical marijuana patient in the state of Florida and this video is to show you a an easy way to save some money by reclaiming all the stuff that's left and your distillate cart store you're just a little arranges your carts basically any container that has to concentrate in it you can do this with it and reclaim some of that THC as you can see what I got here it's a doesn't smell great you know it's been degraded at this point I mean if you look at this jar this is over probably six months or something that's a lot of sizes and carts in there as you know these parts when they get to the end of their life you know the oil doesn't do so well in them they start browning the oil so you know this isn't gonna be the tur piaced it's not going to be the tastiest but it's very effective and one thing about this stuff that I found is it leans towards the sedative side probably because a lot of the THC or at least some of it I don't know exactly how much but has converted into CBN which is a sleepy cannabinoid so but it's very effective and it's pretty strong so I'm just gonna show you how to do it you collect all of your old syringes carts well first let me go over what you're gonna need you're gonna need a jar you need some 99% isopropyl alcohol you can use 90 percent or 70 percent if you have to if I wouldn't because it's a pain in the butt evaporating 99% alcohol is so easy you could just leave it on the counter for a day and it will evaporate you probably do need to run a fan over afterwards to maybe a little heat to get every bit of it out but you could just leave it for another day and it probably get most of it all now you stir it up a few times a day excuse me so you also need a funnel you'll need some coffee filters just regular standard sized coffee filters and I'll show you how to cut them now you need one of these it will find screen sieve or something like that parchment paper put your collected reclaim on scissors I think I said panel so evaporation dish if you want the silicone go for a silicone dish because this is a little annoying but you know these mats have their place you'll need some tinfoil I'll show you what that for a little bit I think that's I think I got everything obviously something to put your dad's in alright calling them dabs but really I should say reclaim is what it is so first step put all of your used syringes and carts into a jar and you know I like to use a jar that's as close to the volume of what you're reclaiming as possible so this in this case a big old ball jar or cur mason jar anyway so you fill this up all the way to the brim with alcohol leave it like this for a day or so and you just want to come to it several times a day like a lot of these syringes and carts where the old stuff has built up it's dark brown and that's because all the terpenes and stuff are oxidizing in there and that I find that it turns into kind of a varnish almost it's still got a lot of active ingredient in it but it's a it's a much stickier tougher not sticky but more of a hard varnishing type surface and you know substance and it's harder it doesn't dissolve as well in alcohol so what you need to do is give the alcohol time to work on it this isn't something like a bud where you just put it in there there's stuff in there that's been treated by heat and that makes it harder to dissolve so this will take at least a day probably now I haven't tried this but I bet what you could do is put this in a hot water bath and then it might speed that process up to like you know a few hours a couple hours or just so after the day is done and you've got and you're looking and you can't see buildup in there you don't see like a bunch of spark stuff stuck in the corners of those things hooray so you take this well actually first we need to get your filter you see how I've cut this down you want to cut it down because this is going to absorb a lot more of your active than this so the way you do that is you can fold it in half and you just keep folding in half so you get into this cone shape right here alright now take your screen put it in the middle of it this is so you don't make your thing too small and you want to cut it you just put it right in there a little like this the tip of it and then you cut it right on this rim right here just a little bit there you go that's not hanging everywhere that's basically all you need you just want it to sit down in there if it's hanging out of the top too much then it'll have a tendency to try to get out of here yeah it doesn't like being shoved in this thing now you take your excuse me you take your evaporation dish now if you're not using a silicon dish and I think even if you are what you're probably gonna want to do is you see this right here and I've used several different this is just the latest thing I've used but they always have the problem of this thing can just slide right off now there's a couple ways you can deal with this put it in like an Allen or something this is a better way to deal with this just taking a little strainer and just wrap some foil around it and use that as a spacer that will keep your basket right there all righty now take the jar and just pour the liquid in here it can be helpful to use this this won't let this funnel will not let any of this stuff through obviously so you can just work straight into the phone and not worry so much about just pouring out the sides you don't want your gonna have like sediment and stuff from that that you don't want to vape you don't want it to be in your final product that's what we're using this screener so this is a good way to just see what as much bad in there as you want it's not going through only the liquid alcohol is coming through all right so once you poured all of the brown liquid golden brown I guess out of here through this you're gonna have just a pan of alcohol solution in here with a bunch of THC at this point there are a few ways you can deal with it you could put this in a hot water bath and just get a bigger pan basically it has a lot of water volume whenever you do a hot water bath you want to make sure that you know the amount of hot water you're using is is is enough to kind of overwhelm it's to the the other substance that you're trying to evaporate you know with heat that heat energy is gonna is what is making it evaporate so you you need a plentiful supply of the hot water and you just let that stay in there for a couple hours um it would probably take longer than that without a fan so you had a fan it might get it done with that timeframe but if it takes too long you need to start changing out hot water out periodically until it's all evaporated so that's how you do it and here's what I got what's my result after I scraped it up I should've gotten a fool here a little bit it'll work let's see if this is focusing very well and so this is the result it's I would guess about 2 grams of this stuff maybe more and um so what I kind of started to say earlier is that the consistency is different depending on how what kind of stuff you're using and how far you take it and see look you can butter this stuff up pretty well or not butter own or they call it taffy maybe I like taffy I'm not sure if you can get this to pull and snap without a whole bunch more heat treatment you know likes more heat and air running over it look at that how pretty this is so it was dark you know lightens up really well this definitely it doesn't have a great I need to say yeah it doesn't have a great smell it kind of almost doesn't smell very much at all and this is just mostly distillate almost all distillate so that explains why you know this isn't why this is not reclaimed from add a break or anything like that this is purely the leftover stuff and cartridges and just lit syringes so alright that's about all you need to know and this will get you plenty high I'm probably gonna use most of this in edibles edibles aren't my aren't the most effective thing for me but they are good for sleeping nighttime pain relief that kind of stuff but this would definitely make some potent edibles and you don't really need all the weed flavor when you're cooking you know that's sometimes the weed flavor is it doesn't really complement what you're cooking with so this could be really good in that respect it just seems pretty neutral and definitely get you medicated very well medicated all right well thanks for watching and check out I've got some true leaf lemon OG came in 29.3% oh man you've got a scene you open one of those things up delicious it's one of my favorite strange lately out of tree leaves alright thanks for watching", "KurpY8TmkNE": "hi there

think about the elite", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "7pdgC2TnHfk": "[Music] today I'll be reviewing and comparing the tax era and the cz against each other to show you the differences the pros and cons of both and which is actually worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to dive deeper into either one of these vape pens have a suggestion for another vape pen or just a question let me know down below if you want to see more cannabis related content like this stay subscribe to see my newest videos like the next one we'll be showing you how to refill these pods with your own concentrates or follow me on social media if you enjoyed the review please leave a like thanks for watching", "wWN8KL2KLvQ": "although friends have we doing it's been a decently long time since I did a video I apologize for that you know it's just like anybody you sometimes you struggle with content that one of release really good content so it's just been a few minutes since I release and stuff today's video I get a lot of questions about is what are we going to do with your leftover carts and we get a lot of these you know questions about these cartridges there's so many of them there's a bunch of different ways they connect together and really but it's really quite simple you can definitely get inside the carts even if there's a lip just a little bit of oil less than that we want to make sure we're using all that yeah this is a very expensive program and using all your medicine efficiently is really what's going to make that make or break it one month to the next without further ado you're gonna need a few things so I got what I did is I put a hook up excuse me a couple different cartridges together just show you different brands who we got here we got standard forms brand cartridge we got GTI brand cartridge and then we have a Terrapin brand cartridge right these are simple they just screw off they're not hard I'll do one for you right now this particular one is GTI and you just squeeze here and rotate righty-tighty lefty-loosey real easy to way to remember don't you get that off that's your trash this is what you're going save now some of you might be wondering what in the hell are you gonna do with that that that's gonna be worth my medicine there's a got a lot of things you can do you could soak it alcohol you can soak it in warm dump MCT oil or like tonight what I'm going to do tonight is I'm gonna heat up a little bit of high fat milk on the stove and once it's up the temperature I'm gonna drop like no no like 10 of these and there mix it together you'll start to see the milk turn like you know an amber color if you use the llars or the co2 carts how about them light tint to it that's your indicator that nicely you know this is already smoked up you know and you just kind of stir it in there you know not overheat this is something we made out of so it does get warm so it's okay to begin something that is warm you know you don't want to go ahead and throw them in the milk turn the milk on high and boil the cart in the metal together I don't recommend that I always heat up my milk and one for my milk is that temperature which is just slightly similar in our a little bit of bubbles I'll go ahead and throw it in there I'll mix that together add a few little bit of a chocolate then I'll mix that together but that's in a different video we'll do that specifically for the other brand cartridges like let's see we got here like your moxie carts or your LLR carts yes Koecher tangi whoa love it best corn ever and then you got your where these that's your outage this is your another one of those Cresco carts as well all right so we got that banks are you know what to say in a christelle cart this is actually a grassroot cart so these three carts here have compression fittings and this is why you're going to need these two tools and the two tools I'm speaking about today it's just like pair of vise grips pair of needle-nosed that's all I'm going to show you how I'm going to take this apart let's move this camera down here to see these guys are able to see what's going on on the table alright so once I've worked with a lot are these crest coats like I said kosher tangi you know sorry everybody all character changing is my favorite cartridge in the whole program it's amazing if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you check it out we're gonna want to do this right where that strip is you're going to get that in your vice grips now if when you initially put that down there I can't squeeze that it's too tight you don't want to squeeze it too tight so then you're just gonna loosen this up which is gonna allow you to lock that end see that and without holding it it's gonna not fall out and we want it to not be able to be wiggled either because if this is you can wiggle this that means it's not tight enough even if there's a little bit of play in there we want to make sure you got as much tightness as possible you know without squishing it okay so that's how that's going to look and then you can try a couple different ways you can put it on here and just work your way back and forth slowly but surely you don't want to squeeze this metal piece here bat metal piece if you squeeze that a bunch of times you're gonna make it hard for yourself I come out here or what I do another good trick is to stick your needle nose inside there put a flap down on the table and just give it back and forth little Wiggles stabilize your base of your car just so if it becomes an issue you can get it out what I like to do is increase the tightness on the court remember you don't want to squeeze you don't want to squish it and then and as you can see I'm squishing the crap out of the top of that but sometimes that's what's needed if you just wiggle back and forth boom off cam your piece and as you can see the end is good and I squeezed out of there and now I can gain access to all my compression fitting carts with all my medicine in there and that's what that end piece looks like I know you ladies are gonna ask me where I where I got this sweet little robber thing for the car actually a buddy of mine and 3d printed it for me my man Eman you're the man dude thank you so much that's awesome all right so just dump gonna do one more a couple one more here with these twisties just so you can see it up close just kind of twist it that's it if that has a bunch of stuff on there you can even throw that in just don't throw any rubber in and buy rubber you'll see like that sometimes I had this little rubber piece or they come on the bottom you don't want to go thread up and there don't kind of get in your way I know another one of the carts that have a big problem is these Moxie carts I'll do one more of these just to show you squeeze it right there clamp it down stick your partner map there we go squeeze the crap out of that hmm actually the moxie was easy easier to get often the crest Gallic has like it's like a little rubber piece so it just kind of flexed off on me which is nice that's pretty cool now you just kind of repeat this process until you get a bunch of carts opened any stuff you can move away from the top you feel free to do so but all that hot liquid is gonna get inside these carts so you can just leave these open like that and believe it or not there's another thing you can do now I don't recommend anyone just doing this but you can definitely get one of those extractor kits with the hollow needles and just suck up as much oil as you can honestly this is I've did that before this is still the best way I've ever figured out how to use my empty carts it's very efficient people are gonna ask me what's your dosing size generally when I do this I'm doing this on a Saturday or day I know I'm gonna have off I'm gonna do about five to ten carts that have a little tiny bit of oil if you get one like especially the standard forms ones oh wow I caught that you see how much of that is up there that's a lot of will right so maybe on this batch if I have something that has that thick that much oil at the top caked on there I might drop it down one or two carts just cuz I know it's gonna be pretty strong that day you know and then you know like I said I'll be making more videos and I want to definitely make a video on how to actually put these in some form of edible or drink and I will definitely be doing a video that in the future so thank you every much everybody thank you for watching take care of yourself and each other and hang loose", "y3Bjg6nlYyY": "what's up everyone john here from respect my region and today we have another west coast wii tour review and we are going to be doing a vape review we have a tomahawk 510 cartridge from napalm it's a live resin diamonds they're one gram cartridge so let's read a little bit about we'll see what they got on the back here it says tomahawk live resin diamonds vape cartridge 69.01 percent thc 0.78 cbd and one point seven two percent total thc um weight one grant net weight and then just tells you the total weight with the cart um twist the cartridge onto the compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved so um pretty vague on the information on the box but the box itself looks [ __ ] stunning i mean look at this napalm it has nice raised edges you just like grab this and this really does feel like a luxury cannabis experience you know you buy this and you feel like you spent your money well i guess is the the best way to put this so napalm is partners um with exhibit exhibit is behind napalm cannabis and he fancies himself a firearm if you've ever watched excuse me if you ever watch exhibit on his instagram he's always shooting all kinds of guns and so the brandy napalm cannabis the grenade pre-roll it all kind of makes sense you know all kind of based off like military hardware um so i'm gonna go ahead and slide this open and a nice slide box boom and right there we got a nice nice the cartridge is beautiful with the green um some of these are orange too so it just kind of matches with what the strain is you've got the green branded flame look we can really see the color of the oil this is a gram cartridge i have smoke been smoking on this i was on vacation in wenatchee so um yeah but you can as you can see the color of the oil is really translucent really good definitely looks like live resin let's see if we can see it move that's the other key with live resin is you want to be able to see it move like with your eyes and yep it's definitely um moving in there you can see the the liquid is starting to go to the top of the cartridge so i'm going to go ahead and pull off these little rubber stoppers scroll this onto my battery you never want to over twist so once it's on it's just boop stop most vape pens click five times and it's on let's see what's up super turpy terps hit your back your throat you definitely i have no idea um what the tomahawk is what if that's like a into mix meaning they just took two different types of starting material and blended it during the extraction process i'm not sure if tomahawk is is a strain of theirs one of their uh you know flagship strains but i definitely get like a really florally earthy taste it's nothing spectacular but it's really smooth and yeah let's go down this uh the rating score 10 point that's a 10 categories 100 point rating system let's see what's going down presentation presentation i got to go with 10 it looks wonderful from the sliding it out with just the the little raised edges of the flames and the whole the gold trim it looks different it stands out and that's and uh you know napalm cannabis it's easy to remember it sticks in your head so yeah i'll give the presentation a ten product appeal nine um i i think it would get a little bit higher if there was a little bit more information about the oil in it about the the strain that went into the oil it says live resin diamonds but uh you know a lot of people don't even know what live resin diamonds are honestly so i would like to know a little bit more about the strain and stuff to to maybe get that perfect that perfect product appeal score color yeah you know you go with a nine it looks really really good the oil is just uh fantastic it looks really good nine color i did color smell um you can't really smell you know i don't really get like a turpy smell through the car or anything like that but when you rip it you just get like a basic vape oil smell it doesn't smell crazy terpe so i go five taste seven i said didn't blow me away by any means the taste uh i didn't really get like a potent terpy taste potency uh i would give this this is gonna get a good potency for i'd give it a nine um i started smoking this last week i ran out of dabs and i switched to my pen and this more than got me where i needed to go um when i wasn't smoking on dabs you know five or six rips of that and i was blazed for sure so high potency score experience um i'm gonna give the experience a seven i definitely didn't hate it but i definitely didn't love it you know i wish i just got more flavor when i think right live resin i just think of crazy terpy flavors and i just kind of got like a basic vape distillate taste you know didn't really give me the live resin experience more information they definitely give me all the basics about you know manufacturing packaging things like that i wish i got a strain lineage more information maybe about what live resident diamonds are somewhere on the packaging you know they have two boxes you could put some stuff right here just because uh you know then the knowledge around extracts is still very um niche in a lot of ways and so i would like brands to take that step up to educate the consumers more on their packaging would you recommend i actually would recommend this though i would give this you know not a strong mega recommendation but i definitely you know my friend hit me up was like yo what do you think about napalm cannabis i'm like bro you should probably get one of those you know live resin diamonds cards because they are nice they look cool the the cartridge itself is is awesome like the design behind this is very cool it looks cool so yeah definitely a seven on the recommendation and overall yeah stick with the seven as well like i said the flavors didn't blow me away but the quality is obviously present so i think napalm cannabis is definitely on the right track to um you know just absolutely crushing the game and that's all i have for you today make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel uh check out respectmyregion.com on youtube because we have a bunch of content coming soon video content and make sure everyone has a good day and i'll see y'all later", "2fZK7ykAPBI": "yo yo sup guys back here for another video man it's a sort of rainy day today it's kind of cloudy hasn't rained yet but um I'm about to go to a dispensary called purple Lotus and I'm gonna buy a bara garden because my raw garden is pretty much empty if it even shows you it's pretty much empty so I'm gonna pick up a raw garden so then we can do a review of these new cars that I got up in Finn and I've been waiting to even try these I haven't even tried it yet it's called Ursa extracts Ursa extracts this is live resin I don't think it has any additives or anything so we're gonna test these out I'm gonna put the link to their Instagram and stuff down below check those guys out there kind of a new wax I've never even heard of them so we're gonna try them out and we're gonna compare them to the raw garden we're gonna see which one's better but we got to pick up some more raw garden because this shit's done sup so about to knock on my friends door and he's gonna pretty much take me so I'm waiting for him he doesn't want to be on camera so using probably not gonna be on camera this whole time sorry guys but how you doing bro all my friends dog dogs except for me as you can see we're gonna get out of here soon guys oh I'm still mad I'm mad about these versa extract the only thing I'm mad about versa extract and I want them to explain to me is how how is this a gram when it's 659 milligrams of THC and 2.3 milligrams of CBD that makes no sense it should be a thousand milligrams all together for 1 grand if I'm trippin tell me I'm trippin in the comments but I'm pretty sure it's a thousand [ __ ] milligrams this is almost like I have [ __ ] gram it's like a big-ass bubble it in [ __ ] but it's probably hella good we don't even know if it's good so I don't even know but no cars guys new cards so we're gonna see what it is I'll get back to you guys when I faith back in you guys already know [Music] [Music] we just pulled up about to walk in here probably won't bring the camera in because I don't think they'll let me record even though cookies let me record inside there I'm still not gonna bring it in just in case you know I don't want to be awkward as [ __ ] but we're gonna go in here bro didn't get as much as I thought I was gonna get but here's Nicki from me this looks like he got the Mendel punch golden gold sauce cartridge strawberry banana cartridge and then yogi berry let's check this [ __ ] out [ __ ] was how much was that [ __ ] BAM 177 53 after taxes for three carts oh four carts I mean sorry four cards one two three four and I only got two cars because I'm broke and because I already bought two other carts to raw garden mendel punch dough see about 120 125 up the tag [ __ ] taxes guys um it's gonna be like an hour and my card 17 minutes just to get back so that these were all garden carts then Nick he got some unique [ __ ] never tried these the Cresco tell me if you guys ever tried them if they're good in the comments you know if you try the cress goes and and you know if you tried the rolls I've never tried to roll I don't even know how to open this box man it looks confusing us [ __ ] probably not even confusing but probably get the taste those later maybe finish lets me get some eventually and then he got the raw garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking for a good rock garden flavor to get it has punch in it or some kind of berry in it usually those ones are pretty good honestly compared to banana bread definitely good banana bread was cool though I ain't gonna diss banana so we out and we're gonna get it we don't get it Ian soon we just gotta find a good place to smoke man all right guys it took [ __ ] forever to get back here but we're back and it's kind of dark so I'm not even gonna go outside and smoke or are we gonna go so I don't know what do you want to do we gotta go outside can be smoking it so we're gonna try this real quick behold alright so we're gonna try out the banana OG first I don't know if I'm gonna try the next one yet but well I mean we're gonna try it

alright guys here goes I'm not gonna lie this [ __ ] is [ __ ] shits ding this shit's powerful it tastes like legit just straight wax was put in there you're taking a straight dab so I guess the live res like it has no distillate no nothing nothing at it cut it to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw garden stuff we got to try that we got it compared to the raw garden no one's better so far though I like the Ursa this shit's pretty dim did

and you know stood that the robber so I love mm I was like oh I gotta go because someone else hit me up and made me go to a movie or something baby I love you I don't know maybe this won't even make the video but [Music]", "ljdgvqCZHW8": "attention i want my videos to look like this and not like this so if you're under the age of 21 and don't have a medical marijuana card leave what's going on everybody willow g here back again with another video in this video i'm doing a vape cartridge review i'm going to be doing a vape cartridge by papa's herb this car only cost me nine dollars they're half gram carts and they're only nine bucks i copped three of them so 27 bucks for three carts is really not bad at all i would think they were fake but i've had homies do reviews on them and i've also i've seen reviews on home pages about them and it shows that they're not but i just went straight into this and opened this up without saying anything i'm going to start off with the lemon cello today the limoncello is a sativa and i'm gonna go sativa hybrid indica gotta go in the right order oh there we go all right we got it open i know in one of my videos i told you guys if the carts in a bag it's probably fake but i take that back because these carts aren't fake and they come in bags most cards that you find in bags are fake don't buy no exotic fake [ __ ] mario kart type [ __ ] that's a scam so i got a new battery today it's called a yo can and it's electronic it goes from 2 volts all the way to 4.2 i think so i'm gonna give it a go with the papa's herb cards let's throw this in here oh [ __ ] that worked perfectly all right five clicks to turn it on uni pro it's at two volts right now because to taste them i'm gonna have it at the lowest setting and then i will try them out at a higher setting too so here's lemoncello on 2 volts cheers you guys damn that really does not rip at all let me try it again hold up there's a 10 second rip right there on two volts but that actually tastes very good i can already feel it in my head low-key carts don't really do much to me but i you can't feel it it's this one is 85 along with the gelato 33 i believe yeah and then the granddaddy perp is 87.5 but they're all around the same so you're probably chilling on whichever way you go it just depends on what your preference is with sativa hybrid indica and taste plus there's more on flower cup there's there's six flavors right now but i only got three let's try one more hit but let's put it up to 3 volts for this one cheers [Music] i can already tell that going up to four is just gonna burn the coil because three rips pretty fat [Music] all right that's enough for the limoncello though i'm gonna get this out this battery though is actually really far i'm low-key more hyped on the battery than i am the carts but that limoncello was good it was actually very good for being a nine dollar cart like you do not expect much from that [Music] next up we're gonna try the gelato 33. this smells good as [ __ ] already oh my god this smells really good way better than the limoncello did all right i had i don't remember who it was that told me but someone told me that granddaddy perp and uh gelato 33 were the two best out of the six so i'm hoping that they were right throw that bad boy in there cheers [Music] yes yes yes yes i like the taste a lot of this i like the gelato 33 taste way better than the limoncello so there's my first rating of it is that it's much better than the limoncello let's give it a rip on 2.5 volts [Music] even like french inhaling that it didn't tickle my nose and wax usually like tickles the [ __ ] out of my nose and makes me sneeze so i'm really liking the gelato 53 i might have to make this the first one that i neck all right let's take a rip off three volts real quick and if i'm feeling it i'm gonna do this one on the max [Music] but so far if i were to rate these out of 10 both i'd give this limoncello like a seven out of ten because it's good and i mean it actually like for some reason i felt it which i don't know how i felt it that's crazy the gelato i'm gonna give like an eight and a half to a nine like somewhere around there like the gelato is really [ __ ] good you guys i'm gonna take one more rip of this before i go on to the granddaddy perp i'm gonna bring it down a little bit cheers [Music] yep i like it i definitely like the gelato let's get this [ __ ] out for the grand daddy purp finale see what i did there all right this is two point five percent more than the other two cards plus it's an indica which ain't smack the hardest everyone knows that so let's see how this is because because i'm excited to see if this hits me in the face i'm gonna pull this down to a 2.2 cheers you guys cut it yep that tastes exactly like a [ __ ] granddaddy purp should taste i've had so many granddaddy perp carts i'm hype on that because i at least have an indica wax i only have sativa with my stizzy right now so i've just been chiefing stizzy wax um that's sativa it kind of sucks because when you want to go to bed at night and you hit a snizzy that has sativa in it you're like but uh yeah i got i got indica now let's take a rip off 2.5 volts see how it is let's take a rip on three volts of the granddaddy perk cheers [Music] before i take a giant rip off of this uh limoncello card i want you guys to do me a favor subscribe follow me on instagram and follow me on twitch everything's going to be in the bio and it doesn't take very long it would help out immensely when i hit 1k on here i'm doing a giant giveaway so just know that all right you guys the grand finale i really don't know how this camera is focused or where it's focused but i hope you can see that it says 4.2 watts right now we're on the highest wattage um i'm just gonna rip it for as long as i can without dying and coughing the lung out so cheers everybody [Music] that wasn't even big what the [ __ ] the cloud was big but it didn't hit like crazy crazy maybe i didn't take a big enough hit let me hit it one more time to 800 subscribers you guys here's to 1k thank you guys for watching like comment subscribe do it all peace i'm out damn you", "F20EmG4W9Vk": "oh it's not above to make me change like a castaway you know you pay that you bought the cooler today hey guys I just shot this entire video and I wasn't even recording man so I'm stoned as heck right now having to rerecord this for you guys but it's alright that's alright so without further ado guys my name is Teddy G welcome back to my channel for today's video guys we got something crazy we got a freaking comparison all right guys from two of the biggest brands out on the market right now we are going to be testing out this dizzy live resin and we're going to be comparing it to the raw garden refined live resin alright guys the only reason we're doing this is because I felt like you know these are two of the biggest brands on the market right now in terms of cartridges so it would be just fun to just see what's that what what is the difference between these cartridges you know what is the taste difference what's the why is raw garden refined light resin and why's dizzy luck regular light resin and we're gonna touch base on every single detail as to what each company brings to the table and just so you guys know man who is the best live resin out there right now before this video starts though I want you guys who are watching this video right now let me know in the comments below spam that [ __ ] let me know what do you guys think is better we got this dizzy live resin or we got the raw garden and refined by resin so hey let me know if you guys have tried any of these and let me know what's your favorite and why alright guys so without further ado man I think the only thing there is to do now is to test these out get an ice and stone and let you give you guys the full rundown as to what I think is better alright guys so we are going to be testing out this one right here which is the key lime pie it is an indica and we are going to be compared - the banana slim from raw garden which is also indica the raw garden is sitting at 85 point 95 percent of THC and though it is e itself is the seitan at a nice seventy nine point seventy one percent THC all right guys so the difference is already you know seven to seven percent differential in the THC percentages is it really going to make a difference I feel like it all depends on the product itself man it all depends on the strain it depends on you know yeah I think it just depends mostly on the strain and how much smoke consumption you can get because obviously if you're not getting enough smoke in your lungs then you're not getting hot so I don't know which one to test out first geyser so we got the key lime pie plus the sour gorilla which is a hybrid I'm just trying to compare both of the indicas though so not that we go with this dizzy first alright guys so we're gonna take a big fat blink of a note off of this dizzy and tell you guys the full flavor profile what kind of time it gets me get to be right off the bat because with the blinker man you have to feel something right guys so cheers boys if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 man that's all I'm saying choose the initial flavor flavor that I'm getting I am getting a little hint of like select a line like Elvis citrusy which is pretty freakin cool man none to say the least but I uh I'm also getting that natural like if you guys know if you have ever smoked live resin you guys know that it tastes kind of like it doesn't taste burnt but it does taste like like obviously something very very earthy that like you know it's something completely different than the within what you're used to if you smoke raw garden something completely different man this type of live resin you know is actual live residence how it's like you know the industry standard of live resin and that's what's tizzy puts in the pot so comparing it to the refine light resin though so pretty much what raw garden does what they're refined light resin is they take out any extra lipids and things like that carcinogen I mean I'm not really too sure if it has carcinogens but if they take out pretty much any extras that they really don't feel should be vain alright guys so compared to this one this one might have NEX some extra lipids just from the process of the you know squishing the plant itself as opposed to this that it's gonna take out all that extra stuff so that's why you also get it so clear right so it's just refining it that way you get a better end product it's basically what they're trying to do so without further ado guys I think we should just go in for a fat little toke and yeah choose [Music] oh my gosh dude the raw garden blinkers literally they kill me every time I like I used to when I first started smoking these I used to take blinker after blink after blinker but by now man I don't know what it is but they're just so like so much harsher now and then what they used to be it's out there so much harsher or it's just my lungs they're you know slowly decay ting but either way man it doesn't matter yeah take touch base on both of these though man off the first two initial hits like this one right here I got it was it wasn't as Turkey is what I'm used to to the to the raw Gardens but they that's what sucks about these is they always change man I mean the base flavor profile Oh is always the same you know it's always usually the similar taste but I'm talking about the Terps you'll get some that are really really really chirpy and gassy and they just like you know expand your lungs and destroy your lungs and then you'll get something like these that are kind of kind of subtle like you know the Terps are very very subtle in there but they these always have more Terps in my opinion compared to these live residents from ste I like the the ones from Suzie honestly they're just like very very smooth and they're not too harsh on your throat like I said like I could let you guys saw me take a blinker and just take it like a champ right okay as opposed to this when I was coughing like a little bit after like these are a lot smoother the live resin is they give you the full entourage effect so the highest completely completely different guys all right and that's what I'm gonna touch base next after after the flavor profile so yeah this is like a more plant-based you you're not really getting too much Terps it's more of just getting you the full entourage effect and what that does is basically give you a full spectrum hot alright guys as put to this this one it's just the flavor puffs on this is just turquoise tantrum and likey there's nothing else to say about it I mean not this specific regarde in general you know they're known for being gassy for being therapy and yeah man so flavor-wise I do like the raw garden a lot more so next up on the list though like I was saying we're gonna go based on the highest and I know I'm not I'm not basing the highs as a right now I'm just basing the overall highs that I've had in the my past experiences and I'm gonna just let you guys give you guys the full rundown all right so with with the Stacey live resident I do get the full entourage effect all right which is basically I do feel like very very soothing it's a very very soothing high man and it's not if you take a blinker you're not gonna really feel that high right away it's a high that progresses so every single time that you take a hit you're gonna get more and more high and it's not really a very very rapid high at least for my personal experience is it is a slow high but once you reach that peak level it's a very very enjoyable high as opposed to the raw garden where I feel like this one man you it's just in your face it's just very very in your face but the thing is it doesn't it's like quick it's a quick high you get me so you'll take a hit of this you'll take a blinker hit of this so you get a very very stone you'll feel like like oh my gosh dude like I'm stoned right and it'll last at least for me it'll last for like 20 minutes at most and you know I feel like I have to take another hit to get that high again and it's just not it's not it's not a soothing high as opposed to that how this dizzy is right this one is just like I said like I was saying it's very in-your-face and it's a very being rushed high so you just like you just like oh my gosh you're like I'm a high like I'm super babe and then um you don't really get a chance to just chill out in my opinion you know it's a very very like dude like I'm afraid and I have to get like you know experienced the highest opposed to this one you could just sit down and chill and enjoy the full effects of the plant and how it's supposed to be soothing you which is really really weird man it really goes to show you know the different types how different types of live resin waxes things like that affect your body affect your mind and things like that so take it from take it from my point of view guys you know give different things to try don't just be stuck on one product because you enjoy that hi you know there's you'll probably find something else that you might like a little bit more you know so I think the only thing we we talked a lot right now but I think it's tough to get nice and baked so Cheers [Music] like I'm super bagel I was saying in the beginning of the video I made I want to say it was at least that eight to ten minute video guys for you guys and it it was going so good in my opinion who is it was really really good but I'd like this one's probably gonna come out a lot better just because I picked out my flaws on the last one so this one was just kind of just donating rolling rolling rolling but yeah that kind of pissed me off a little bit but we're already started so really couldn't be too pissed off but I'm just enjoying it I'm enjoying doing these videos for you guys I love the support that you guys have been showing to me man if you haven't already what are you doing man go ahead and hit that subscribe button it supports me more than you think alright guys so let's go in on this raw garden hit next Cheers [Music] therapy super therapy we tell you guys like the flavor profile from the raw garden is just completely different from this dizzy man and I feel like that's what that's what's gonna really make this decision hard is the fact that I feel like these two even though they're both like resin I just feel like they're two completely different things you get me like right here we got a very chirpy pen that's just a very very completely different high right here is something that's very very subtle but it gets you it's a very very soothing high and yours you're getting the full flavor profile from the plant as opposed to this one I mean I don't know I don't know it's like you get me if I smoke the plant well it will it give me the same high is what I'm trying to say it's like I don't feel like I'm gonna get the same high but I like with if I smoke the plant from this but if I were to smoke the plant from this I feel like it would be around the same high you know and it's kind of something that that I don't know if that just kind of brought it to my attention is the fact that you know and why how much can the highs really change from the bud look at that bud state to the wax date you know and it's very very crazy man they're very very crazy guys so I'm gonna be honest with you guys I am NOT gonna be able to decide who's gonna be the winner because like I was saying there are two different completely products and I'm gonna need your help for this one guys all right so let me know in the comments below I want every single person watching this video to comment down below if you've tried these products which one do you think is better and would like tell me why tell me why do you think they're all arms are better tell me why you think this dizzy is better right I want to know your opinions I want to make this interactive video and hopefully you guys are down for it so because I can't really choose I'm gonna need your help on be 100% honest right so I'm gonna drop this video today and you guys are gonna we figure out which is better than what so without further ado I'm gonna end out the video go upload this and so you guys have something to watch alright guys hope you guys have a blessed day don't forget to leave a like comment and subscribe and we'll catch you guys on the next one we practice is a great function on the ground buddy know cuz I've been super buddy I'm some to the runaround are you sending me are you coming now cuz I'm post on", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the

video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "kfFCn_25EtQ": "introducing the all new cool jars 810 hotshot 1500 are top-of-the-line lightning fast kart filling system capable of filling 12,000 cartridges in an eight-hour day with next to zero waste an absolute minimal clean-out required for the next minute or so we're going to give you a very quick look at this remarkable new system to include its speed precision and flexibility you probably have questions and may wish to see more so will follow with a detailed step-by-step guide to the installation and operation of our new 810 hotshot systems for openers you're looking at the number one reason you need our hotshot 1500 speed at the rate you're now watching you can fill this entire tray of 50 carts in a few ticks under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done

to the product spotlight of the lava core heated oil cartridge filling gun now a lot of you may be saying well what the heck is that well stick around to the end of the video I'll demonstrate it but here's what comes inside of the box you get the unit itself the heating unit and then the gun there's a couple of tubes that will show you what you use those for there's an instruction manual of course there's also going to be a power core to supply it the gun itself as you can see there a couple of tips and some additional washers and o-rings now let's take a closer look at the front of the device you'll see the LED control panel and the heating lights and the connector where you'll connect the actual heating gun itself at the back there is a rocker switch to turn the power on and off and the plug for the provided on a 20 volt outlet at the tip of the gun is where you will put the attachments there's a little pin or a needle type attachment that you'll use to fill cartridges with the middle of the gun is the chamber that's graduated to show the 25 milliliter capacity then there's a rotating dial that will let you dial the output of the gun from a half a milliliter all the way up to two and a half milliliters for different size cartridges there's a release mechanism that will let you release the plunger that pulls and pushes the oil in and out of the heated chamber at the end there also as an adaptor or a fitting where the rubber hose will go that you use to pull up the oil the function and features are pretty simple you power it on the top light the red one shows you the current temperature and then the green one at the bottom shows you the set to temperature and you hit set and then you use the arrows the directional arrow to the left to scroll between singles to ten to the hundred degree range and then the up and down arrows to set the actual temperature and then it heats up automatically [Music] and now for the usage of the gun the gun is intended for filling oil cartridges of 510 thread or what ever kind of oil cartridges the size you use but the tube that you see there is used to put down into the VAT of oil that you're using and then to draw it up into the gun you then use the trigger to push out the excess air that may have accumulated in turn filling then you put the tip on and then you set the size cartridge that you have I have half a milliliter cartridges here so I set the gun to half a milliliter and pop every time I squeeze it it puts the exact right amount into the cartridge of course this is probably for more for manufacturers

welcome back to the icemoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm going to be taking a look at two new flavors of the goods disposable distillate vape pens if you've been watching the channel you would have seen my review of the grape ape last month and boy did i enjoy it there are two new flavors out this month straw nana and blue dream both of which i really enjoy anyway so i am going to try these out in the video today and let you know my thoughts so if you want to get your hands on any of the goods distillate vape pens you can do so on the hemphealth website they retail at 19 pounds 99 however at time of filming they're on offer for 15 pounds you can even use the discount code i smoke 10 for 10 off let's take a quick look at the packaging that they came in so the box says ingredients broad spectrum cbd distillate and terpenes instructions for use our vapes are auto draw activated simply take slow smooth drags until the desired effect is reached do not exceed 70mg cbd a day must be 18 plus to use this product good manufacturing process certified gmp big thanks to the goods for sending these over for me to have a look at today they come in the same packaging that the grape flavour does that the maui wowie flavor does with the package that you peel open to ensure freshness inside this little box inside we have the vape pen which looks like this and it's actually a proprietary vape pen it's not using a c cell cartridge but rather is using their own device in this pen is 45 cbd distiller in this case flavored with blue dream and in this case flavoured with straw nana this is part of their hustle range which is for the daytime and this is part of their chill range which is for the evening although being a cannabis consumer i tend to just consume them whenever i want that flavor profile and with great results as well each of these will deliver up to 300 puffs but that is going to completely depend on how big your puffs are you can treat this more like a dab pen and do some quite big puffs and get some quite big clouds with it or you can sip it and it will last longer they don't actually have a charging port because they are single use you just use it until it runs out and actually you never need to worry about charging it worth mentioning obviously as a disposable product in 2020 it's not as eco-friendly as something that you would use again and again but they tend to last quite a while and i'm still only using my second or third pen so i'm not creating a lot of waste with it so what i'm going to do now is try out both of these flavors and let you know my thoughts starting with the blue dream here we go oh that's got a nice flavor profile to it so it's kind of sweet blue and berries like all together as one literally no hemp taste at all it's just pure terpenes and that is very very nice blue dream is actually up there on my list of cannabis strains the distillate delivers a really nice turpee flavor although it's not going to taste like if you were smoking blue dream in a bong for example i'm impressed with that really easy to vape as you can see you don't need to press any buttons hold it to your lips and inhale let's take a look at the straw nana flavor profile which looks very similar it's the same device but it has a different logo printed on it this is a really cool thing about the goods range say you had different flavors just sitting there on your desk you can flip them over and see which flavor is which very easily you're not going to get mixed up not that you would once you've tasted them anyway but the the color code and the little icon on the back is really handy in that regard looking at the straw 9r1 i could actually smell this when i opened it and i was like really excited just from opening it out of the packet and getting that terpy aroma i'm going to taste it now oh that is the terpest of them all that is strawberry and banana and the blue turp and yeah mercene all the nice ones that that go into um like the sort of sweet good sex tracks i think leaves a lovely sort of taste on the inside of my lips there and it's really present during the exhale as well really can taste it as i'm breathing it out lovely straw nana really really good indeed which do i prefer out of the two that's an interesting one i did this with the grey paper and the maui wowie and the grey paper came out on top when i'm trying to pick between the blue dream and the straw nana i'm leaning towards the straw nana because the flavor profile is just so distinguishable you can smell it you can smell strawberries and bananas you can taste strawberries and bananas both of them deliver a really nice smooth vaping experience but this one has got a really deserty kind of feel to it which i really like so do i think this is a good product and how do i think it compares to other stuff on the market personally i'm not vaping c cell devices anymore i'm just vaping these distillate pens from the goods i didn't vape a lot of vape pens anyway but these deliver a really nice responsive result and a really nice flavor as well so i've just found myself vaping these i also think they're worth it as a product on their own merit because 20 pounds for a single use vape pen that's going to actually last you quite a while and give you regular hits of cannabidiol i think is quite a good deal when you factor in how good it tastes it does make it a really easy decision for me and i will certainly be getting some more when this runs out but if you are really stuck for flavor profiles and you can't pick between them then go with the straw nana or go with the grape ape in my opinion you will not be disappointed one thing i wanted to try was just trying out these flavor profiles together just to see what they taste like blue nana or straw dream it's a nice combination guys what do you think of this video have you tried any of the good disposable vape pens from the hemphealth website do leave your comments below let me know your favorite terpene profiles and i will catch up with you in another video in 2021 folks thank you so much for watching it has been an absolute pleasure this year here on the channel thanks for joining us on our 2020 journey looking forward to 2021 as always thanks for watching and keep talking [Music] so [Music] you", "yJjIx2A2zHk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is Shabazz and I'm back with another CBD and flower review now I am super excited about today's review we have an amazing product over hope is gonna be amazing from the vendor we've seen on the channel before my CBD Haven my CBD Haven has my opinion probably the best CBG and CBD concentrates you could get currently well they just change the game and they release read what that says delta 8 THC distillate syringes you might be wondering what is delta 8 THC well the THC that is illegal is Delta 9 THC there are other forms of THC in cannabis THC a THC v delta 8 THC Delta 9 THC is obviously the most psychotropic the most strongest the most noticeable it's the thing that really gets you high and that's why that's what is illegal in most places Delta 8 THC is not illegal it's legal so just proving your started in case you're wondering right now man this is too good to be true yes you can order it in all 50 states it's not illegal it's not Delta 9 THC this is Delta 8 THC which is not illegal does Delta 8 THC still get you high to put it bluntly yes is it as strong no he says racy rushy no no no from just from what I've heard in my research everything I know Delta 8 THC is kind of like a watered down version of regular juice definitely stronger than CBD stronger than CVG but not as strong as THC or I should say noticeable or psychoactive and with that means that it doesn't cause as much anxiety we got Delta 8 syringe we also have CBD syringe and a little vial of the same stuff in each here goes the delta 8 and this is the CBD with my CBD Haven logo we also have test results all right so we're gonna start off with the CBD distillate and that CBD comes in at four hundred point two seven milligrams all the COA the test results with a small amount of CPG CBN and CBC so that is a nice combination a nice smorgasbord of cannabinoids right there so let's see here goes it's a syringe and while I'm opening this the awesome thing about these syringes is you can use this oil to dab with you can dab it like wax you can make edibles with it a lot of people just simply enjoy putting it on top of flour rolling a blunt or smoking bowls of it and it does come with this little skinny applicator so so I'll give you up close that's what it looks like you unscrew the end of it out like that and then you put this in you screw it in and then then it's ready for whatever today I'm gonna be dabbing it so that we just get the pure effects of that I don't want to you know I would recommend personally putting this on top of flour to kind of you know intensify the experience but it since I'm reviewing it I want to tell you exactly how this feels [Music] [Applause] we're gonna squeeze this right into the banger Wow there's no flavor in that no harshness I mean it's my pure CBD distillate so I wouldn't expect any kind of harshness or flavor this is really really interesting now even though hitting concentrates like this usually does take effect immediately let me kick back for a few minutes and just let it fully sinking and I'll come back and let you know how I feel a few minutes later all right I'm back that was interesting it's just so interesting to feel CBD without any other little bit of THC or anything CBD by itself is very like it's not like psychoactive psychotropic it is very in the body and behind the scenes so I don't really feel any different right now maybe a little bit more relaxed but this type of thing is intense concentration of CBD this is really recommended for people that really need it for like medical reason so if you have some kind of ailment you know I don't know I'm not gonna go through the list but if you need a high dose of CBD and you need it quick this is perfect you know those little syringes are you know it's so convenient you can carry them everywhere like I said you could just roll these on top of a joint stick these on top oh really quick just a tiny little dollop distillate I have absolutely nothing to compare this to because I'd obviously never tried anything like this before but I'm gonna give it the sebastio approval I think if you really benefit from seeking you by itself this is a really good option to get a very high concentrated dose of it all right now to the main attraction the real reason you're here this is the Delta 8 THC cartridge 66.3% Delta 8 THC 0.62% CDN so 66.3% Delta 80 X and I'll just think about a few Mets with something at 66 percent Delta 9kc you're gonna be gone like you're gonna be in space packaging everything is the exact same deal appearances exactly same little syringe the little adapter piece to get it you know in a small amount you know same same deal we twist this piece off right here and then we twist this in and you do have to kind of handle it for a little while because at room temperature this kind of settles and hardens so you got to get it just a little bit of warmer than room temperature so that it starts to know so that you can you can get it moving down the row syringe so we're gonna handle this for a minute and I'll just talk while I do this I am THC sensitive like I told you before I love cannabis but I cannot handle the high concentrations of Delta 9 THC it just makes the experience unenjoyable for me like I know it does for many others in the hips and CBD community Delta 8 THC might be the perfect answer if you thought CBD was a perfect answer well this might be a way to enjoy th see without the negatives that come with it for some people [Applause] all right here goes to Delta Wow once again no taste no throat burn I come coffee is just irritated from inhaling something but absolutely no harshness nothing it's interesting I'm getting the most craziest sensation just like a wave going down my body and throughout my limbs Wow I know wow it's hitting me it's hitting me fast and it's hitting your heart and I want to break away for a few minutes but I almost kind of want to share this experience with you you've ever hit if you've ever taken a hit some really strong TMC flower concentrate and you know that feeling you can feel it come creeping on handy just you know and you could that's what this is doing right now it's just creeping along heavy and that's it's getting me this this is amazing there's like seriously right we thought CBDs would like the answer to our prayers I mean there are many people in McD's amazing CBD will forever be you know the standout aside from THC but there's Delta 88 see this this doesn't this feel like th it just doesn't feel like City this feels like so like strong hopes to make city but I'm not feeling literally any anxiety in Russian I don't feel my heart beating faster I'm not worried about nothing about what we're thinking anything I feel like I'm baked but my head is clear like I'm able to control my thoughts and food I just feel like yeah I feel like I'm Paris Thomas [Music] Wow Wow this is amazing this is amazing yeah I just I love I love how clear-headed I am I love how control I am of my own thoughts and everything my own feelings I'm not letting anything get the best of me this isn't invoking those kind of feelings and I think that's amazing well here it is it but it ain't here I think this is the answer to a lot of people's prayers a lot of people who want to enjoy cannabis and maybe CBD flour just doesn't do it for you a regular THC but it's too strong here you go right here you could thank me later I'm really glad I'm doing this review because not only am i reviewing the product yourself but I'm putting out some awareness about what Delta a THC is and what it does and that's awesome because I think it needs to be more focused on for sure I think that this is probably the best thing in cannabis and I think if you mix Delta eight with CBD you have the honest-to-god perfect combination Wow this is Bob this is Bob I'm sorry I can't shut up but this is absolutely bomb I have to stop myself someone just let me say this is one of the best things I have experienced in the hemp world since I first started using hemp flour and reviewing hemp flour this is I mean this is this is amazing more focus needs to be put on those Delta 8 THC and obviously this is concentrate so you know 66% Delta 8 THC so you know it's not this isn't light weight one tiny drop does it take my word for it I put just a tiny tiny squeak like the size of the drop of water and that's it that's all you need pretty sure this feeling is gonna last for at least a good 45 minutes to an hour I don't think I need to say do I need to say this gets the Shabazz silver pool now I believe there's other Delta 8 products out there they're few and far between my CBD Haven is a stand-up company I I could vouch for them this right here this right here this is dope definition soo cool I love this product I love what's in this product I really like look at this this looks official this looks official like you could whip this out people in like am like what you doing me like look at this do it over here this is spicy spicy pan I'm enjoying myself

hitting on the hundred federal officer on the audiotape trying to pick her up and sitting there on their pigment in a bowl of oatmeal", "GGGW1xP3Uyg": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video and if you couldn't tell from the title this is overall garden video I mean got the sweater on as well and I got the cartridge as well and yeah like the title says this is basically like a video just letting you know that there are fakes when it comes to raw garden it's it's so stupid in the cannabis industry once you've been like once you become like an established company people are just trying to like make money off your name they're trying to sell fake products under your name and basically with your heart the hard work that you put in for your company is just easily easily used for another person's gain you know and that shit's not the business you know and we're gonna be talking about the fakes when it comes to raw garden I have a few pictures that was taken from raw Gardens Instagram let me just pull them up right here so I'll also be putting it on the screen right here so you can get a better look of what I'm gonna be talking about and another thing I'd like to mention is that I guess my packaging is a newer packaging so it's not gonna be I don't know like here's a thing with raw garden and with other companies that do the same they're gonna constantly keep updating their packaging because like I said people are onto their [ __ ] and they're they're gonna just keep you know they're gonna keep at it so you just got so we're gonna bring it up right here and right off the bat you can see that the font is different and actually the color is a lot different especially the the font on here it says like I'll post on the screen don't worry but basically you could tell from the font and where the positioning of the flower is I guess so right here I got the tray clip good I bought this from flavors I'll post it right here I mean they have it on their website as Walt rock garden if you go it on raw garden the raw garden up farm you can actually search up all the dispensaries that have it there legally so I bought mine at flavors as you can see right here all that good stuff let me just so I'm guessing that they had to update this because they just pulled over the QR code but I mean you can go and check all these I actually don't have a QR code like scanner oh I just download one real quick so we'll see this [Music] basically running the same but the numbers are a little bit different I mean it says right here eighty one point zero three zero five and then this one's eighteen point eight six so I mean you gonna have to take my word for it I bought it at flavors I do not have the receipt on me but if you didn't see that video previous from this I showed the receipt in there exactly not bad just gotta be careful with the raw garden you should go on their Instagram also to basically check out how to tell the real from fakes you know this is it right here very very clear stuff and yeah I mean I've been hitting this already and it tastes very very good it does not taste like it's some fake [ __ ] you know and you guys know me I've been I've been getting raw gardener for years now and honestly like I would know if I had a fake [Music] good stuff this is the chill battery very very good battery for itself for what but like I said check out the photos or the pictures that rawr and put on their Instagram yeah it's a little bit different actually it says four right here it actually has the percentages right here as well but I guess they switched up the new sticker so yeah I don't know they just keep changing a [ __ ] every time so at the end of the day like unless they update those pictures it's gonna be hard to tell you know because they gotta keep switching their packaging because each time they [ __ ] get settled in these [ __ ] people just trying to fake the cartridge fake the packaging and all that stuff another thing that I've noticed from the pictures is that that ever should be on its own column or its own row so the other ones they actually has no additives ever in one single line so that's another that's like the biggest difference that I can notice just by you know looking and scanning at the box ooh and if you guys haven't seen Shaka x4 20 video on the subject already please check it out it's a dope video I posted it online community posts so if you guys haven't checked that out already you should really check it out does good content similar to that of mine so you know if I don't upload you know I'm saying you got more other content creators to go and check out them you know so shout out to you Shaka X 420 shout out to you your boy should be some cool collabs if that were to ever happen but yeah I'm gonna take one more hit and we're probably gonna end the video here be careful with the roll of iron cartridge you know I like when they was first brought into my attention that raw barn has fakes or had fakes and stuff I was really like hesitant like I was like no I'm gonna copy raw garden you know because like I don't know I just I just didn't think that they would and sitting here now knowing what we know like anything can be copied it's crazy so if you're an upcoming like cannabis company [ __ ] I don't even know how to like avoid this you know maybe like some really intricate into your kids ass packaging that is alike cost a lot so therefore they wouldn't buy it because it costs a lot I don't know who knows but I'm gonna take a million hit for you guys and we're gonna call it a video and uh I just had plumbing service at my house and one of the plumbers actually watches my videos so whoever you were I forgot your name but it's a small ass world and it's crazy like he came up and he was like it simplistic you me what you do videos so I was pretty interesting but yeah shout-out to you thanks for doing a good job on our plumbing you know I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably gonna end the video here [Music] these are guys [Music] [Music] you", "HxbthKzHWNE": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is another fake cartridge video I recently came across this fake cartridge if you're curious about the title about fake cartridges evolving let me get to that first of all my homie my homie comes up to me and asked me if this cartridge was legit or not not like actually physically coming up to me but like through a facebook Messenger and this brand the so-called brand that he brings up is can i clear he tells me that the oil was slightly pinkish which was like a red flag right off the bat you know you never oil that's pinkish come on like bias the the branding question is called can you clear and why ice titled this video fake cartridges are evolving I mentioned it in my lives recently so if you guys were in there you probably know what I'm talking about but basically when you think about fake cartridges you think about think face or supreme babes and a really good indicator of them being fake is that they're using copyrighted material maybe like cartoon characters from a beloved cartoon series or smartcards you know taking a brand's name and running with it with their own thing you know basically taking the brands likeness and applying it to themselves anything with Bank faves just their names already give off a red flag but this one can a clear I'll post it right here it's probably the most out of all the fake cartridges the most legit looking and I'd like to mention that you can just tell by the box shape that is very similar to the box shape of dang babes mind you that the packaging outside appearance is different it's still the same box shape everything's still the same and before I start this any further I do not have never tried a canna clear I've never heard of canna clear some people probably would assume that maybe it's a real brand then then they kind of just you know the black market kind of just took their name and went with it in the into the black market that could be the case but as far as I know my friend came up to me with candy clear said it was pinkish oil and it was like 30 bucks okay first of all you know I told him go to the club you know you can get a cartridge from the club for $30 now you know I'll be it's not gonna be we're all guarding quality but it's still gonna be good I got the free cannabis cart for 2350 at one point you know I just want to make this video you know I know a lot of this debate related deaths have actually been slowing down now that coronavirus has been here I don't know if that's uh actually like you know goes together in any way but I'm pretty late with this because I went to read it and they said kind of clear six months ago was faked so this is something new to me like I said my friend brought it to me I was unaware of a brand like this existed I know there's other brands out there but I feel like this one is probably the most dangerous one because it's it looks [ __ ] legit you know so as I'd like to just make this video and you know tell you guys let you guys know beforehand like myself you know I'm know probably some of you guys have probably heard of this brand already but like I said I only heard about it just a few weeks ago and I figured some people are like me as well and don't know about this brand so it's good to spread awareness for those of you who tried canna clear let me know your opinions in the comments down below you know did you have a good experience where'd you get it from did you get it from the club but just be aware you know that there are fakes out there and that's the thing when it comes to fakes you know it really just makes you paranoid it's kind of like this whole coronavirus thing where you don't know who has it you know and I don't know it's just just be aware guys you know I'm not saying all of them are bad but like I said there's fakes out there what raw garden is kind of different because raw garden if you go to a legit Club you don't have to worry about fakes at all you know so I know some dispensaries have had fake cartridges and I would assume that those dispensaries were either non licensed dispensaries or that they were just ignorant to the fact that maybe they just bought stuff thinking that it was real you know but like I said can I clear it's crazy it's dangerous you know I'm saying can it clear it's a very dangerous fake black-market cartridge because like I said it is it looks legit you know it really does but like I said the box shape is still the same as database very same [ __ ] all you're gonna see pink oil I mean need i say more oh yes I'm gonna take a sip of this t be aware of can of clear guys okay so if you enjoyed the video or if this helped you in any way you know please feel free to like it if you want you know I'm saying but other than that have a nice day [Music]", "KWYreO14T1I": "all right what's going on YouTube it's your boy chirpy Tom back with another review MPX grim dog a grim baby saw a grim baby lineage is

sauce right so it is full spectrum live resident harm percent cannabis oil denied see seulji man she said technology right this was $80 at brown half around a center I picked it up as you guys can see the head space ready one thing I do not like about this packaging is that anybody can go in open it up i straight take out and put in whatever the [ __ ] they want right there's no type of SILS

kinda has like a cushy kind of like purple kind of like a grape soda kinda yeah at f1 I like this this is a nice tasting thank you this package variation or the time the golden is standard but for $80 would I buy another one for $80 no I would much rather stick with the live cartridges from [ __ ] Cresco to be honest with you yeah $65 over $8 there's a lot more a lot better but you know with the $20 off of using my points it's what makes a 60 bucks is still still I won't ever do it again I just you know did it for a review and in the in the tribe but it's not bad I like the taste of it do I feel the effects as of now not not Jett let me take up more pools the taste is crazy just like it's like a soda pop I like it I like the taste of it really the taste is really really good oh you definitely get the the lung expansion feeling all that good stuff I'm sorry fill it in like in the head I do know that this is a indica dominant I believe yeah everything I got today was indica

flavors great tastes like tape great crepe and cushy everything it's a really good taste it actually reminds me of something that I've had before but yeah only thing I don't like about it is the price range the packaging is pretty cool and that's the second thing I don't like about about the packaging about this product is that the patching like you can open it up and put any [ __ ] type of thing you want in there so um just make sure you're like once the [ __ ] the person packaging people put it in there just put like a little thing I don't know if this part here is supposed to be like you know like stuffed or he can't open it up but it definitely was not like this yeah anybody could get into that no child per for anything like I said that's the only really negative thing I have to say about this cartridge in the packaging everything else is wonderful I mean I'm definitely feeling a nice buzz right now I'm kind of feeling more lazier which I really didn't want that but you know it is what it is I'll get back up and get motivated here in a minute err but uh yeah go pick it up make sure you smash that Lake subscribing all the stuff I did playing for you guys hopefully you guys did playing with me turbot I'm out peace", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "s79qD-XsbsY": "[Music] we're really gonna be talking about real carts versus Street carts I'm gonna be really honest guys real carts are the ones that come out from a dispensary they are licensed and everything to actually be making these type of TC cartridges Street carts aren't Bank babes exotic cards supreme cards supreme no exotic carts thanks Supremes Mario cards what's another one car tonight which I just saw from I think um Jimmy Jam too damn man that's a street car cartoon carts that's a street car Kalli plug that's a street cart um what else let's see what other ones have I see you those random ones that don't even have a name just like lemon haze that's a street car even I think SoCal is a street car there's a lot of cards up there that I just made and the packaging is bought compared to something that's really licensed Lee made and actually the spent like actually sold at a dispensary have you seen this right here there's a VBS pen this is an actual dispensary cartridge made by Ben baller which is the owner of EVs and if you look at it guys there's no THC percentage if you look at any other cartridge in the street all of them have a THC percentage which is not real this does not have anything at all the only thing it tells you in the back is the servings and the well the suggestive serving and how many hits you'll get off of the off off of the cartridge suggester serving says one five-second inhale Indic indicates activation basically every five seconds is a serving and this contains a 125 servings basically 125 hits and for best results stored up right at 65 to 75 Fahrenheit and it says right at the bottom it says governor government warning this product contains kind of as a schedule 1 controlled substance keep butter reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is qualified patient the intoxication effects of cannabis product may be delayed up to two hours cannabis used while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive an operate machinery please use extreme caution and look all it says at the bottom guys is at BBS pens and their website VBS pens calm you can find VBS pens on weed maps we demands is literally a website that helps you find a cartridges or whatever you're looking for in different dispensaries that selling you you'll find VBS everywhere on we to maps and this to tell you guys this is animal cookies look at that that says there right there SC labs so there was lab tested you can look it up and you'll find the lab says results on this cartridge look when you slide it out look at this I already finished the guys these reviews will be dropping soon but I literally wanted to bring this up cuz I've been seeing a lot of cartridges coming out and I know I smoke dank things alright I'll be honest but the main reason why I smoked them is because they're easy to get and they're really cheap compared to one of these like it actually the spring seeker guys is not know 20 bucks 30 bucks is not nowhere near that actually the suspensory cart runs from 60 and up so you're paying the right price for you for your good product compared to thanks you're getting like probably like a little bit of THC this doesn't not much or none at all if you're buying the ones that don't even have any at all but look guys the cartridge comes in here you pull it out look this is a point three guys this coaches from EVs from Ben baller was a point three cartridge I bought them and I actually really liked them they're really clean like the hits don't hurt your throat when you when you French inhaling it doesn't make your nose tickle like a little itch or nothing and also you can't really do much to this cartridge it is a disposable so once you once you're done hitting it and you finish your servings it's basically trashed the only reason why I haven't cuz it looked really nice but has just a little bit and I can probably get a little hit let's see barely my battery is dead if you look at it as well look at all these I have three of them guys I had a Sour Diesel which was in this one which is the silver color and it has your California label right here when you look at things I haven't smoking things for a while guys I started from when they when they have their old boxes and I only hold them because these are the ones I've reviewed if you look at thanks guys look at this is mainly to catch your attention like your attention and they look pretty cool but there is no California symbol or nothing like at all guys like all these are just nice design boxes that you know go with the name or the strain that they're selling but none of them guys none of them have anything look I have so many boxes guys like it's ridiculous I've been smoking these for a while and like I said guys just because they're easy to get and they're cheap so they're not hurting your pocket that much what look here's well Supreme Court definitely don't recommend these Supremes Supreme does not even sell cartridges I'll tell you that right now and this one goes of the California lip symbol on it but that batch number is mainly on all the boxes no matter what color of the box is if it's white red blue black it don't matter it's on all the boxes and this just makes it try to seem legit but it's not if you look at these these are serial courts they're meant to catch your attention as well and all they do is just tell you a simple percentage of what it can range which I don't think is true at all look Applejack's my bad guys but Applejack's just got hit by a copy a copyright strike so it's already taken down I'll take the El for that one I think it was mine [ __ ] up on what I did which was put you know the Box somewhere in the video and Boo Berry it's all just meant to catch your attention guys like lemon berry look and they have the THC percentage in the back well ace of spades as well is the same thing guys LA Confidential I got skittles I got mimosa watermelon orange daiquiri which I just dropped yesterday Cookie Crisp like eight ain't no serial company making Tac cartridges like just being honest Girl Scout cookies gelato blueberry kept blueberry pancake Crunch sunset sherbert and key lime pie I have all these flavors they're all Dinks and mainly mainly Dinks but when I finally started getting actual dispensary carts I can tell the biggest difference is you don't really have to be worrying about if that bait pen is real or fake if you're buying it at dispensary it's real unless you know they're doing some dirty [ __ ] but if you're actually getting it from there it's a do you know what you're you're paying the price for the right thing like this one right here is the rose gold version of the VBS pen and this one is animal cookies right there when you slide it out has the California serial number right there you slide it up look the other ones guys are ripped it off I didn't know who's gonna need it but this one looks way nicer so look look at that tells you right here at the top fully charged prefilled disposable premium-quality oil one five-second inhale activation time immediate as soon as you start inhaling in this cartridge it activates it starts burning the oil so you start getting smoke if you see you guys look comes in here look at these fancy little cartridges these are made by Ben baller has the Ben baller symbol at the bottom every time you hit it it lights up if you hit this one but lights up but they're both dead they're really meant to throw away the Sour Diesel one I gave it to one of my buddies so I don't have it I just have the little casing just to keep it cuz say the truth they're probably the best cartridges I tried that are actually from a dispensary I will be getting more cartridges cuz I'm heading down to Cali this weekend so you'll see more reviews on them but guys just be safe I know a lot of people were like you know are saying that you know they don't believe that they faves the streetcars or not I'll tell you right now they're Street carts I review them because a lot of people a lot of people use them and there is good tank babes and there is bad thing tapes if you buy I think babe the the oil is dark from the instant before you even smoke it you don't know what you don't really know what they did to get it that dark now if you buy one of those that the oil is thick and it's like really nice gold and that when you flip the cartridge like this the bubble barely moves that's pretty good too you see distilling and if you don't have to be vaping it a lot to get high that means you got the right product you're just buying a pink so it's not a dispensary card please guys just be safe know the difference between actual dispensary cards and street cards or black market cards cuz they're going around a lot like car tonight I I heard of it that's that's a fortnight name like cart night and if you look if you ever bump into them they have for tonight characters on the front like for tonight is not doing them to these guys Mario Kurtz Nintendo is not selling THC cartridges exotic cards who in their mind will make exotic cards and put an eyeball in their front of the little images like this this is all for like catching people's attention if you look at this this looks more just basic and professional like you don't really have to be oh like this design looks cool I mean when you get them they look really nice but they're maybe just to do their job and then you dispose of them so like I said guys just be safe know what you're smoking and don't forget to like and subscribe down below and also if you have any suggestions while I'm down there in California just let me know I will be dropping a lot of reviews and more when I get back also stay hi guys and burn one with me while I'm over there [Music]", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "pneymr1PpZU": "ONE ONE WAS ONE WAS THREATENED ONE WAS THREATENED WITH ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE ONE WAS THREATENED WITH THE 4@ ONE WAS

Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "A24Y3JyHLAQ": "this video is made of a user's request today I'm showing you how to winterize frozen in a small batch here I have almost a gram of rosin about a point 8 I made just before this video I'm placing into a beaker and adding 10 ml of Everclear I'm adding the alcohol to the rosin so that I can inter eyes it apply like bleep and mix until all of the rosin is dissolved into the alcohol [Music] here importing the rajma and alcohol into a graduated cylinder this is just for the purpose of the video [Music] I meant place it into the freezer and my cool for about 14 hours [Music] after freezing you can see that the wax fats and lipids have separated and sunk to the bottom [Music] here I'm using two syringes to pull out the fats and waxes as well as the alcohol separately this is also just for the purposes of this video to show you the difference [Music] it does help however to pull them out separately as it makes it easier to filter the cleaner portion compared to the waxy portion [Music] here I'm pushing them through a point to two microns syringe filter the syringe filter tracks the facts and waxes and removes them from the alcohol [Music] [Music] in the end I've caused it in alcohol and it's been winterized and I'm removed of any of its fats and waxes alright once you've done filtering you know how fully winterized rosin you can go ahead and use this for edibles or you can further refine it by boiling away the S&L and using it for bait pens or lowell devs my half plate has a built in magnetic stirrer it's a magnet that spins around and spins a magnetic stir bar this automates the steering process and speeds up the overall evaporation it may take some time for all the alcohol to evaporate keep checking back on it every so often so that you don't burn your rosin I don't recommend consuming concentrate that may have ethanol and then often if you are going to do this regularly you are better off getting it back through the final purge process [Music] after you've reduced most of the alcohol up I'd like to put another beaker on top to prevent any ball tools such as terpenes from escaping that having already in this final process removing the last of the ethanol now you can't truly remove all of it without a vacuum so I went to do this for as long as possible kind of medium to high heat right now it's heated at around 95 degrees Celsius I like to let it sit like this for a couple hours from four I feel it's safe to smoke and the ethanol has escaped [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "yeTp-8aHP5Q": "[Music] youtube what up your boy cushy here make sure you hit that like subscribe ring that bell we got the new select cartridge it

drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it

you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for

about five ten minutes I gotta say the effects are good it's just that at that price point you know sit over 60 bucks there's just other carts that are available that are gonna be give a better effect and so this is a you know I know this is available in multiple states but I'm talking about most California and Nevada in California you know select lead arrow Pro I would imagine Korova is probably stronger based on what our reviewers tell me about it than this this I would you know in Nevada roots is definitely better select lead arrow Pro you know and just the fact you can get better cartridges for less you know routes cart in Las Vegas is gonna run you like 45 you know range so it's about 15 dollars cheaper than this you might be able find this a little bit cheaper some dispensaries and maybe even save a 5/10 but you're still paying more than the routes is stronger AeroPro you do have to get a separate battery but those are stronger to and select elite doesn't taste as good as either three but stronger than this so even at another live resin cartridges the most recent I tried was the remedy live resin and I would say that they have better oil they have crap hardware if remedy took their oil and put it in this Harbor that would be an awesome cartridge you know even the clone or they're using now still pretty good but this at 60 you know it's a good cartridge and you know if you're getting a good deal on Vince cartridges and you're not paying 60 a pop it's probably worth that you know if it's on par with like regular cartridge prices sure but I would say even if it was on par with it was the same price as real same price as arrow Pro you know and these or select I would probably go with those still not bad it's a good cartridge if they were running a deal on these I would for sure get them so that's removed my review of bins and I'll throw the straight up on top now when we we look at the pictures but yeah I mean it's pretty strong it's just not best of best and as far as I've seen it so far it costs best the best prices so thanks for watching guys is dad connection and have a great week", "G1VQlA7A9R8": "what is up YouTube family boy Vasquez here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys those who are new here I really appreciate you guys for subscribing to the channel and those who've been here you guys are awesome you know I really appreciate you guys taking the time out your day and watching my videos you guys are the MVP for that and if you guys have any questions and think about it you know you guys just want to talk [ __ ] you know I'll reply to you you guys know could probably be friends you know just comment down in the comment section and yeah guys but let me know what you guys been up to it is Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back today you know I'm gonna be chilling at home so yeah guys if you guys have any good shows on Netflix let me know as well but today we have a special cartridge that like I've never thought to be honest when king pen came out they're really really popular but now they have a live resin like they kind of fell off you know cuz there was a lot of fakes and there was just I don't know they were just bad you know a lot of people they really liked kingpin but there are pretty good cartridges but you know I assume that they came out with the life resin line so I definitely had to go down to the shop and pick them up now they're half grams so I don't know if they have full grams yet but the packaging on these are [ __ ] amazing like you know it's like a ten by the tin box you know so it's really cool but yeah it's a half gram I've got it for like 30 bucks so let me give you guys a close-up on the on the packaging on the back the THC level is like sixty it's 61 percent guys so it's not as high so I mean the taste should be spot-on you know life residence should be always be good but you know kingpin a really shocked me when they came out with the light resin you know I was like what the hell because I thought pink paint just you know was regular distillate which it is but I don't know it was kind of weird seeing they came out with some light red and so some people had said you know to go check it out and they're pretty good so we're about to find out right now so the manufacturing date was January so it's a pretty fresh cartridge still I had paid $30 for a half gram so it should be good you know cuz the full grams gonna be like 60 bucks so you have this little sticker on the bottom and I grab the biscotti flavor because that's the one that stood out the most so we're gonna open it so has a little sticker in there where you can fi your product and [ __ ] like that and we're going to spill it damn it's really excited you nod I thought King pin fell off you know a lot of people don't really [ __ ] with king pin because there was a lot of fakes and they were just I don't know some people said they weren't good but to me they're a pretty good cartridges I really liked them a lot so the pill the little stick off I'm just gonna open the little thing [ __ ] here we have this little thing that came out pretty sure it's just like information you know it says the counterfeit the counterfeit prevention program ensures your product is authentic using a kingpin iZON it's the website where you can go check to make sure that you think is authentic your cartridge I should say which is pretty dope you know and yeah you guys can give you guys a little close-up on it it's cuz kingpin there was a lot of fakes and telling you the streets were flooded with kingpin a lot of black market and I'm pretty sure you guys know appreciate guys I've gotten one before so I personally have gotten a fake one before and it wasn't as good so this one has a little digit code on the on the little sticker we just ripped and you just type that up in little computer and you know it shows that you have an authentic pen which is pretty dope you know just to make sure so we're gonna go ahead and open this up and bam that is [ __ ] sick right there tell me now that is not dope right there guys that is like fancy packaging right there I've never seen a cartridge that came pretty sick like that you know it looks like something something that it looks like something expensive you know what I mean so that looks pretty good right there that's the first indicator which this is gonna be good so we're going ahead and take that out and there's nothing else so I'm gonna keep the uh I'm gonna keep this little box you know can probably put some doozies in it I'm in a couple joints you know take this [ __ ] off but this is what you guys came to look for so it's nice to man I'm also keep that it says kingpin on it and and on the back says made with a hundred percent recycled plastic which is pretty cool you know they feel kind of different which is pretty cool so we're gonna take that off I'm really excited about how they're getting the look and how they're gonna taste so I don't really expecting pet to come out with a light resin lines BAM that you have it guys it looks kind of little darker couldn't a live resin so we're gonna take these little rubber caps off and it says royal on it so I think it's like a collab with Roy I think it's like a different company because I seen a had royal on it so I didn't have kingpin so I'm pretty sure it's like a collab which is pretty dope and I was about time kingpin did something you know to come back but and they came back good with some live resin cards which is not bad you know and we're you guys close up and I'm going to flip it over and see if it's some nice thick oil this is a nice little day in there which is the half gram you know I'm pretty sure the coil absorbs some of it and it does not move at all guys and we're going to dry hit this yeah it's pretty weird cuz on the thing it doesn't say kingpin it just says row as you guys can see but I mean I don't care so we're gonna going that dry hit this and I'm going to see there's some flavors if I get some flavors off it this one's a biscotti so a biscotti is like how can I say to me a biscotti is like a cookie a cookie cross with something I'm not sure how it is if you guys are familiar with the biscotti straight let me know in the comment section below would really appreciate that I mean I smoked it before but I'm just like I said I'm not familiar with the cross it so you guys know and I'm not gonna lie to you guys this thing tastes like a cookie you can get you to get that nice clean Wow it's it's amazing guys it tastes like a cookie honestly if you guys ever had the the strain cookies exactly it tastes exactly like it so I'm really excited about that and I think we're gonna go ahead and hit it out of the yo can okay if you guys have if you guys are ever looking for a battery you know I'm not you know then there's sponsor me or nothing but you guys ever looking for a battery get a yo can you know order on their website or just go to the smoke shop any smokes just have it this shit's a [ __ ] [ __ ] beast you know I've dropped it in water it dropped so many times open beers within it still works you know it comes with a little magnet you just screw on bottom of the cartridge so we're going to do that I'm really excited man cuz it was about time [ __ ] kingpin came out with light resin which I've never thought they would you know I thought they would just stick to their normal distillate so here it is we got their magnet on there so make sure the battery's charged guys and let me know what you guys up to on this Sunday afternoon what kind of cartridges you guys smoking on and always don't forget to let me know in the comment section what kind of videos you guys would like to see as well so I know you know what what you bring out for you guys you know because there's times where honestly I go to the dispensary and I don't know what's a good cuz I don't like getting the same cartridges I mean I would but you know I like bringing out a new concept for you guys but if you guys would like to see some new some some of the different I mean some of this same cartridges are over and over just let me know you know I'll do it but yeah guys if you guys are smug along with me go ahead and do so we're about to get high so I'm going to drop this in and I'm gonna drop it in in the battery BAM so cheers guys if you got to smoke along with me go ahead and do so yeah really excited man hopefully hopefully it tastes good right like [ __ ] wow wow wow I'm not lying to you guys this [ __ ] is fired for kingpin a dual life resin honestly I thought it was a joke I thought it was gonna be as good because you know kingpin literally either solis people to come out with live resin and this [ __ ] tastes good it kind of tastes exactly like a raw garden but more of a Terp flavor in there like a strange Pacific flavor like this one's a biscotti and you really really get that cookie flavor him you know that earthy cookie flavor in this fire wow it tastes really good I'm going to hit it longer to see if it like chokes me a little bit so I can get high now I can explain to you guys how the high is it's just making me drool damn yeah this shit's fire guys I'm not you know I smoked a lot of cartridges since ever since I've been smoking I smoked a lot of cartridges before I ran through a lot of them and this this has to be one of the best life raisin cartridges I've tried i'ma have to compare it with the raw garden one day man this shit's fire it tastes exactly like would it like the strain if you guys had a biscotti it tastes exactly like cookie it's like fresh earthy clean taste - it's so good now the high you get a nice good of buzz you know I'm feeling good already I've smoked it in the morning I smoked a blunt but I kind of sobered up so that's why you know I decided to do the review so I can explain the high man but I feel good you know afraid for being 61 percent THC it's not a lot but it it also depends on the strain you know you also get different effects the THC level doesn't always got to be high to get a good feeling you know what I mean that's what a lot of people don't know cuz just cuz you hear it 90 or 80 percent doesn't mean all I'm gonna get high as [ __ ] it's not like that you know well some people it kind of is but to me like some strict like the strains you know they all got their own high so whether it's 60 80 per se you know just gonna is gonna get any hot so I'm feeling good right now you know I'm getting a nice little buzz so I'm going to hit it again just to you know the cartridge tastes good it tastes so good I can probably smoke it in one sitting but I'm gonna try and save it a little bit for the weekend so I'm going to hit it again before I take off gotta go to the store man I'm we're stuck I already booked and these things are so big if you guys ever see the kingpin man you guys you guys got to give him another try if you guys said [ __ ] kingpin before this is the time to give him another try man this [ __ ] tastes so good I'm not lying to you guys they had like four different kinds of flavors but like I said the biscotti ones the one that standard out the most so it is really good you know you get that nice cookie taste to it so do you guys ever see these you guys got a copper you know they're $30.00 1/2 gram right here in California in Modesto California that's where I'm from so I don't know they're probably gonna be twice as much over there from where you guys are from but over here at medical and recreational prices are the same so so yeah guys I really appreciate guys appreciate you guys watching my video and you guys stay tuned for more guys and uh hope you guys stay safe don't do no dumb [ __ ] and yeah just like and comment on the videos and don't forget to let me know what kind of videos you guys would like to see and you guys have a good day guys", "tn6ZpYK-L8M": "guys

"iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional questions or concerns be sure to leave us a comment down below you", "OAeayndHR_I": "so serious let's go I know YouTube has been getting like a little strict on this or before this video starts I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't wanna show you my personal information yo what's up guys you're on your money back at you so this video I have another cartridge reveal for you guys but first off um I'm sure you guys like all heard about like cartridges getting like um like banned in certain states by now and like people getting lung infections and passing away and like all that [ __ ] you know what I mean so I'm just like really curious to know what you guys think about like all that it's like go look everything going on I'm curious to know what you guys think so tell me down below in the comments um yeah I'm thinking about making a video on the subject myself so if you guys want to see a video about me talking about that subject let me know down below in the comments - yeah I don't know that whole thing is just like crazy and I just wanna know what you guys think about it so but besides from that um in this video I don't know if you guys seen it or not but we're going to be reviewing the branch rib and I've actually reviewed this brand before if this [ __ ] wants to focus please yes I've actually as it upside down yeah it was is I've actually reviewed this program before in the past but I never reviewed the own the live resinous aren't sauce cards so this is sounds fire especially this rate I got too banana and cream sauce like banana and cream sauce I don't know that just [ __ ] so inspired at least to me in my opinion like banana and cream sauce live resin sounds fired as [ __ ] so if you guys seen that it's tested at seventy seven point four percent THC 0.5 percent CBD at point almost point one for almost one percent CBD m5 CBN which I'm not going to familiar what that is if you guys want to educate me it is leave a comment down below some will be some over the packaging real quick I won't waste too much time on there and then we'll open this up we'll get to smokin on it if you guys want to see more reviews I like these pods let me know down below in the comments too cuz I was looking spots heavy um besides from now yeah just happened to the snow so the front of it is said um this drip or nose extracts live present sauce bait my huge five point eight milligrams suppose that happen yeah it's a half a gram part I don't know why this [ __ ] doesn't want to focus right now there we go just so yeah drip see it decide take this little sticker off its own on this time she said some premium quality drip extracts and oils so a pretty simple packaging you know to me the bad just has like the Arizona's Department with that department of health warning all that good [ __ ] that they had to put on it you know what I mean test results on this side you know I mean then you just pull it out like this yeah you just slide it out like that and you're greeted with this so the first look at the cart of bananas and cream sauce [ __ ] this sounds fire to me my opinion so I'm expecting this to taste like so yeah I'm expecting this to taste like [ __ ] amazing so the way I usually like your beauty videos is I'll go over like the packaging to the packaging I'll give this like I actually like to like this package in a lot is just like not too much details on the package and like about the actual oil itself not I mean if you guys want to you can go on the website and check them out whether it's social medias right there yeah go check them out if you guys want you definitely have some fireeyes products but I wish you just have a little bit more information about the oil one strain on the packaging but besides from that it's I like it on least like I like how they put like the shiny letters and I don't know it's just it's dope you know I mean I don't know I just like the package inside if it had more details on like more information about the the strain and like just the oil itself I'll probably give it a 5 out of 5 but but since it's like lack and the information a little bit I'm gonna give it like a four and a half out of five but that's just like the packaging so the packaging pretty dope next we're gonna go over like that the looks of the oil slick not like that the quality or taste there anything you're gonna mean just the [ __ ] the looks of it so this is looking a little dark but not bad I mean it could be like that the comodoro could be big but it could be due to like this trillion it could be good like how they like so many [ __ ] fact there's there's so many different variables I could look at that the color the oil but the clarity in like the assistance these like the most important or everything else this oil is a little bit art I'm not gonna lie the consistency is like fire though this it's not movement as you guys see the clarity is there I mean you can see straight through it there's no like fogginess or no white [ __ ] in it you know I mean so that's a good sign they mean it someone it's medical dispensary I buy [ __ ] drip products all the I know about fishes I know this is some fire I know it's not no like booty juice in here so I mean it's just I never seen like the oil this dark or that's interested but like I said I never had those sauce cards before but besides from that [ __ ] to my battery um there's gonna be smoking this off of um my CB v so yeah we're gonna be smoking this carted off my CBD 5-pin there were nice too nothing to send me this pin and actually [ __ ] with her a lot whatever pens I had yeah um the looks of the war dodo one out of five the consistency is definitely there like I mean like this [ __ ] is like no I'm moving at all that's not for have an hourglass right there the clarity is there you can see it like how dark the oil is you can see straight through you know what I mean but I don't know I'm not really liking the color too much I wish it was a little bit lighter but everything else about is fire um I was gonna say 4.5 out of 5 but if it's only because like the strain that is this color I've learned I can't really give it a negative rating because of that so I don't really know yet maybe I'm just gonna say 4.5 out of 5 when it looks a bit so now we're gonna do a little taste test so I'm gonna turn the song I happen in the lowest temperature so I'm gonna take a couple small hits real quick see what this tastes like and do all good [ __ ] I'm gonna put it like a little high yeah I'm gonna put on the higher temperature take a couple of batter hits do my little smoke test and like a little high test yeah they're not available I'll go over like the price point with you guys a little bit and then um we'll just to like overall review and then I mean so yeah stuff you guys are smoking along I hope you guys have spoken up the bank and you guys are Cheers let's get it again we're just I'm gonna taste this first so Cheers yeah yeah I barely hit that [ __ ] that [ __ ] ripped that [ __ ] like definitely has that lung expansions in yeah so that should definitely if you like one one expansion in your chest um yeah blow me going for another hip dose I don't really get too much taste in that here so um yeah Cheers so it tastes more like this like this strain I should have expected this I don't know why I was expecting to taste like some like them what does it bananas and cream yeah I was expecting that tastes more like the flavour bananas and cream rather than the strain that doesn't cream um if you guys know that the strain but how does in cream it's um that's a cross between like blue dream banana hoji and like a Ocean Beach oh gee it emits like a strong note of orange and like experiment in this thing yeah so has like a like I'm strong like a orange and experimentation know what I mean and that's definitely what this tastes like you can definitely taste like that um the orange you like it's like minty flavor I don't it's like definitely like a weird unique taste kinda hard to describe let's think I guess that's the best way you can describe it it's like an orange like mint taste kind of it's not the most tasteful I'll give it like a three-and-a-half four out of five that's not the worst tasty car it's [ __ ] fire it's definitely probably um I'll be going from one wearing it don't put on higher temperature and do that little high test so Cheers yeah definitely fire though but I definitely taste like that strain more than my passion but and isn't cream flavor but yeah I'll give a like a three and a half or four or five somewhere around there but let me put this on the medium I'll put on the medium temperature in the middle temperature so I'm gonna take a couple fatter rips now I'm probably thing up when hearing it this time so so yeah let's see all the smokes now and then we'll do a little high test to it so Cheers if you guys are smoking along again let's go that's definitely fire ooh when you think of that rip with that you can definitely feel that in your chests like almost like a [ __ ] tab like um um definitely [ __ ] fire um let me go for one more hit and then I'll give the higher a little taste but let me go a little bit hit you know I'll get the higher reading but the way this smokes I think I make of that like a 5 out of 5 because I just moved wow you guys seen issues so the way smokes 5 out of 5 I guess that also kind of depends on your battery you know what I mean and the temperature and a whole bunch of [ __ ] but the way I'm talking it's 5 out of 5 but let's hop back into this so I'm gonna do one more hit then we'll do a little high reading and then we'll go with the price point [ __ ] so series and let's go oh definitely a fire card here's another look at the oriole focus there's no last look at the world pretty far I mean it doesn't look like the most potent oil with [ __ ] away trips yeah this is fired it away smokes think I said 5 out of 5 at least for the one smoking for me right now but the high test I mean or the high reading I should say I'll get the high up for a car that's fire I'm not gonna lie I'll give it like a four point two out of five it's a pretty fire car but I've had better parts that were more potent obviously out there so it's not like the best part I've ever had but it's up there with some of them the price point it was $45 which is a little pricey for a half ground cart but considering this is like made without real live resin I know there's a lot of brands out there that claim to use live resin but a lot of them really don't I know for sure this is this company like they actually ain't there one of the friends that actually like they do that they actually do use live resin you and I mean so for the quality you can justify paying a little bit more but forty five bucks for a half a gram or that's kind of a lot you know I mean I can get almost like two to three brands of wax for that price so the price point I'm gonna give that like a three and a half out of five maybe three-point-eight out of five I don't know it's somewhere around there I still I've been saying this forever but I feel out of cards need to get a little bit cheaper they just they're good for the convenience II like the portability and how easy they are the smoke but like I feel like to put the price point on them grow like I mean if you did it like if all you do is smoke cards like if you bought it's like a half gram card last seems like a month when you buy a half a gram of wax that [ __ ] will probably last you twice as long as a cartwheel and it's pretty known it means so that's the one thing I don't like about cards when I go to a concert or something like that you know I mean all right did he discrete that's when they're like really really helpful and like come in handy I still feel like I'm gonna get Reapers you guys agree with hear it disagree with me let me know down below in the comments but the overall score on this car 45 bucks for this own Nana cream live resin sauce card reading on this like a overalls for a four out of five a fire card but the price point is a little bit expensive like I was just saying um there's a couple of other brands out there that are around the forty five dollar price point out honestly me I'd prefer to kick over this court but not to say that this part isn't fired but I just I don't know these brands that I'd rather have in this brand but it's still a fire car you know that means so I'd still be picking up I mean I don't know the main I saved on a lot of videos but mainly only pick up arch and a half I won't get one free Thea was going to me because I feel like that's when you get the best bang for your buck not to keep this video stretch um yeah I don't know if you guys want to see some more car reviews and videos like this we've spoken and [ __ ] like that I'm gonna down below in the comments and you guys are you know I'll do that ship uh besides for that I feel like the Lighting's in a little bit [ __ ] up in this video I apologize for that but give the video a thumbs up comment like subscribe like that's [ __ ] you really know what to do spend your money ready peace out", "Y7BRhEtOlx8": "hey guys what is going on today another cartridge this raw gardens now this is a company that has been faked like an insane amount so if anyone of you have experience with this company real or fake let me know let me know how it looks different from yours whether you think you think or know for a fact that yours is real it does have lab results I scanned it it brought me to the raw garden website except one thing one one little discrepancy I noticed the batch number I typed it in and it was for a different string it was not dojo cush but and then I typed in dojo Kush and I looked for the one gram one and it was like a two V two to three or something so I don't know if it was a typo that's mad weird what if it was fake why would they even put in the effort of putting a batch number that was two away from the real number why not just put the real number many questions you can pause that it and read that if you want to manufactured bang bang Best Buy bang 21 we're good ingredients you can let me try to get it you can pause that right there if you'd like to read that let's see Oh God a lot of writing composite right there if you would like to read that why they skipping spaces here I schedule 1 controlled Oh am i bugging contains cannabis like no spaces bro come on you're gonna turn the font-size down one the [ __ ] anyway eight hundred ninety six point four milligrams comes in this nice little childproof container here die here out of here I have chief Don this quite a bit as you can probably tell I'll get comments like bro your plug was hitting your [ __ ] it's like I I have to I have to hit it to review it some just some I hit a lot some I do not hit a lot but I've been decent I don't have any weird feelings about the cart itself even if it is fake I believe and normally live what's called raw Gardens usually clearer than most carts and that this is it looks more yellow on camera but this is clearer than most carts I've seen recently see if we can't get a nice like this so I think this I think this is legit it tastes very clean bro when I when I got this and I was like just named my car and like I left the room and came back and it like smell like weed so I thought that was kind of a good a good sign like it smells good and tastes good it tastes like tastes like bud has like a little bit of lemony I mean yes to it I would maybe if you if you're going to grab these I would definitely just scan it on the spot before you even grab it just scan that [ __ ] see if it brings you to a legit to the right and then you search up the batch make sure it brings up to the right batch you don't want to be smoking Bunco you need to stay safe especially now our lungs are particularly yeah at risk at the moment so make sure you're taking care of your lungs I am probably not gonna smoke any more of this just to stay safe but hope you guys enjoyed if you like this video I got a [ __ ] ton of videos just like it weed carts wax I also have a gaming channel [ __ ] forgot about that yeah peace out", "U9DRhcov5Jg": "[Music] what is up y'all p2 peeps here and today we're going to be taking a look again at the americana or americana blackline og i think it's actually americana um yeah so here's what it comes in big tube aussie i like the tube i don't i kind of dislike boxes when it comes to cartridges because there's already a tube inside the box you know it kind of defeats the purpose of having a box in in my opinion you just decorate the tube like you know americana does there and the cool thing about that tube it's super thick uh let me show you guys again this is super thick like you could fit like maybe like four blunts in here a few joints depending on you know how big you make them like a backwood that's maybe one or two backwoods but yeah so here we got the cartridge americana blackline emoji like i said before and let's take a hit so all you guys out there please pack yourself a bowl a dab all that good stuff get your pen ready about to take a hit cheers it's a steam man i really really like the flavor profile of this um sorry my hair is a little messy because uh hectic day didn't really get to do much with it but yeah i'm really impressed so far is what i'll say about the americana brand in general like i said in a previous video with this i have had the pineapple express uh cartridge before and this is just my second cartridge from them but um it's honestly so good like i personally dislike distillates uh mainly for the taste and i just feel like live resin or cured resin cartridges give me like a fuller spectrum of a high especially that since a lot of them include cbd and things like that but this is probably the most solid distillate i've had in a long time and i have not tried any buddies distillates yet so um that's coming very soon so maybe my opinion on this might change but i've had a lot of distillates and this is definitely really really good like i'd say this is better than absolute extracts that's not a hot take i've had a lot of absolute extracts in the past in fact when i first started vaping uh or you know smoking uh 510 thread cartridges and things like that i started off with absolute extracts as the first brand that was two three years ago and i stopped using cartridges mainly because i was just blowing through them too fast but you know fast forward to now things are a lot different for me but i still have the same kind of taste and preferences you know and this definitely hits the nail on the head it's got a really good flavor let's take another hit and talk a little bit more about the flavor i know some of you guys may have watched the other video so you already know kind of what this tastes like but we'll take another one and let you guys know how it tastes for those who don't so cheers so the first thing you get this is a very very nice sweetness to it so at first i thought it was a sweet aftertones it's also sweet in the after tons but it's very sweet throughout very very like a not too sweet very flat kind of sweet and there's a little citrusiness to it and i'm pretty sure that's the lime part of the name but yeah there's a tiny tiny bit of citrusiness i'm not sure if it's like an orangey citrus or a lemony citrus which is more of the sour kind of thing i do get tiny bits of tang here in the back of a back of my tongue which is really nice you know kind of reminiscent of a lime but yeah honestly for 40 bucks a gram i don't think you can go wrong with this and um i think i want to start a new series on just bargain cartridges you know there's a new brand out there that everyone is talking about and i've tried before too i just didn't do a video on it it's called surplus and they do really great gram cartridges for about 30 to 35 so maybe that'll be coming next after i go through the next purchase and all that good stuff but yeah i'll take one final hit for the road for you guys but i'm i'm really digging this one you know that uh i don't know if i can give it any formal ratings or reviews at the very moment i think i'd like to you know put this up against something you know in a cart comparison before i give it any good things but for as the you know the most i'll say about it is this is definitely a buy yeah cheers everybody oh another good thing i'll say these are really smooth i know i just coughed a bunch but for a distillate they're really smooth like i think that like the flavor of this is very comparable to this dizzy pods the cannabis derived terpenes dizzy pots yeah this is how flavorful these get so yeah i highly recommend you guys give this brand a try p2 out peace", "chxmXCybr1Y": "what is up we have the Rascoe liquid live resin cultured pineapples fresh strange coming in like 72 percent almost TAC I did pretty pretty full but hey you know whatever I recognize torture Joe and that's your dad looks pretty good though shot out alright I got a battery the works or I did three videos already and none of the batteries works Cresco car what is this a pineapple Express here we go I love this flavor it has a distinct herb profile it's like earthy like you bit dirt but like good dirt if that makes any sense probably not battery hmm tastes amazing very good strain tasting on that fake flavoring very very good cartridge very good Phenom melville tomorrow for my homies band the Danvers if we're gonna go let me know leave a comment leave a comment on anything you guys Rock keep subscribing giving away video will be up tonight or tomorrow but yeah you guys are awesome Cresco you got", "xv-7QYC1HhI": "[Music] hey guys welcome back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "FEDCHb49ei4": "HAS.

So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope you enjoyed the video, and thanks for joining us .We really look forward to seeing you again.", "ySeN-3BjSU8": "we have two different types of oil right we have distillate right full spec yeah forget about what we have yeah out there in the universe there are different things yes out there on the universe atom so since the head of a major cannabis lab founder of a major cannabis brand I got the deets so so full spec is basically true - true - flower form so you know they maintain the the cannabinoid profile that exists on the flower terpene profile and they essentially just concentrate it so we do that with cryogenic ethanol here so we make a cryogenic ethanol concentrate then we reintroduce the same terpene profile extracted the supercritical co2 to the oil so the the profile of the terpenes and the cannabinoids is almost exactly what you would see on the flower just concentrated now most distillate based concentrates are more you know you would consider it to be more of like a THC isolate products so we try to concentrate really only the THC delta-9 profile and then a lot of groups will just put that in a cartridge by itself but a lot of groups like us reintroduce the supercritical co2 extract it's her teens - the distillate product then that goes into a vaporizer cartridge or syringe so you can't really call that a full-spectrum product because it's not really reminiscent of the you know the profile as it exists on the flower it smells more strange specific but distillate based right streamers is a dream specific full-spectrum exactly so that's the big difference there you get that Megan", "EHoP0BkWqF4": "try it out much you know what I think about it and I'm gonna give it a shot right now makes me cough my ass off anyways tangy it's got Kremlin on it it's cool it tastes kind of piney that's kind of a piney taste but it gets you guys [ __ ] so cheers I recommend getting this Dragon Ball Z B cartridge", "j1uFvWmihGE": "what's up guys reaper here today we're gonna be talking about row of cartridges how to spot a fake one now this one is going to be one that is kind of simple but it is also going to be extremely extremely tricky and it's going to come down to really one or two things right first of all this is the road that I got I knew that it was pretty hot I knew that it was fake pretty much before I got it just because of the processing on it when my buddies hit me I was like bro I got some rosin Lanka oils I know you've been looking for some Walkers especially asking the cross hanging up the price I was like man [ __ ] I knew they were fake but I was like let me get him he's like I said they'd always says good ol never bought bad oil from this guy but came home that not well actually not that not the next night I didn't I have really didn't even test them out that much price tag on I'm the next not one of my subscribers sent me up on the Instagram asked me how I locked them as opposed to the pic on Instagram I say how Lachlan asked me ways the spot Romans and I was like did I really not even done any research you know so I did a little bit of research for him and within 30 seconds on him I was fake mine was fake for sure 100% the ones that he sent me seemed real but I did a little bit more research and this is where we're gonna get it this at right so the number one thing you want to look for on these boxes is right here there will be you want the California label you know the little California thing I'm just gonna see if it was back here but it's not you know what I'm talking about you need the California thing and then you want the THC percentage and stickers right on the box already it needs to be in stickers so don't let your guy tell you man they were on there they got pulled off blah blah blah all this [ __ ] no so that right there is it you wanted to have stickers that's how you're gonna tell right there if it's real or fake but here's the issue guys this is the car by the way 18 21 years or older smoke along with me if you are that age cheers guys great pull the flavor is amazing it tastes like sweet tarts it's not artificial it's a nice clean flavor the highest grade it lasts it does take about four or five hits to get a no let me tell you let me let me go into this right here if you just want to get a little if you need to like try to help your anxiety or you want to you know just get a little little relaxation calming feeling one two three puffs you're good but if you want to get a buzz if you want to get buzzed you want to get high you want to get smacked you need about four or five but the thing is guys the high with this is so clean and calm it's it's nice it's a nice calming feeling obviously it's it's supposed to be an indica but like I said it's fake so we don't even know if this is an indica in here it does have indica effects now could that be a placebo effect I don't know but you know it is what it is the only thing that I like I said though there's nothing to complain about the hot laughs the flavor is good the pull is good the oil is good in here and it is burning up quicker than I would lock though I've only had this for three days now and I've not been really heavy hitting it and it's going down quite a bit one more cheers guys so now we're going to get into the convoluted [ __ ] right they make fakes with stickers on them the newer fakes that are coming out have the stickers on them some made up amounts just put on there slept on there so now you're saying well how do I know if I'm getting one the trill unless you go in to a dispensary and buy yourself you don't know unless there is another way now this is what we're going to talk about unless you do that you're not going to know there is one other way there is called a store locator did they have for their side and will tell you every store and location did they sell them at that where they are sold and then even then even then you're like oh man I don't know about this or that or what if this happens or that happens no worries real rose now come with a QR code on their books so you just scan it on your phone on the app they have a rose reward app from what on the research I did and it comes on their pups up right then in there you know if it's real or not so Rove has I went into this like man they need to do something because like from what I can tell it's very hard to spot a fake aside just from those stickers in that store locator and then when you're getting deliveries and you're getting on this [ __ ] and you're getting shipments sent to you it's like man how can I tell for real how I mean it's like one of those things where it's like man but then I saw that QR code thing and I was like man props to them for doing that because you know like it you people don't want to throw money and [ __ ] that's not real like if I would have the price I paid for this I knew it was fake right and I'm happy with the price I paid but if I would have paid a price that would adjust the FIDE it being from the railroad company a dispensary price or a prostitute in an illegal state that a lot of these places these people will bump up and throw 5 10 15 even $20 tax on I would have been super mad so you know I can't that's why I'm doing this [ __ ] you guys hopefully this will help somebody but my final thoughts on this was whoever faked it did a good job like I said props to the guy if but I do think that people would just be better off buying their own all these people that have great skills and talent they're going on here week they're gonna put in a position to where they have to buy either these fake cards I mean the fake company carts you know what I mean by that I mean a real company they took real company that put fake cards from that company and then put all in it so and the sad thing is either they can one do that or to put them in stuff like exotics and Mario's Supremes off lights all that dumb stupid [ __ ] so what's the to base the options here can I put my good product in these shitty companies packs that nobody wants to buy or should I put my good product and these fake company packs so the logical choice is gonna be my product is good I can make you know my product shouldn't be put on these standards I want to put them here but now here's the issue is you're gonna [ __ ] people over unless you're doing it for this price right here to where people know like man there's no way that's real that's the only way it should be done but it'd be better off getting done with there should be like a I don't know man there's there has to be a better way than this but I guess as long as people know they hey these are fake those a lot of these TKOs are fake there's certain not just sticky Oh a lot everything's pretty much fake as [ __ ] right now unless you're walking into dispensary and getting it or you can get this [ __ ] super verified if you're in an illegal state or you're in a medical state you know like if you're in an illegal state fully legal recreational you you know preying on having problems but it's just uh it's just crazy out there I know guys unfortunately we're gonna have to wait it out we're gonna have to wait it out of here too until everything gets legal everything gets passed and then at that point you know it'll be on everyone but I'm gonna talk to you guys later thanks for watching subscribe if you're not gonna follow me on Instagram like the Reaper I'll link it down below I will link everything that I've put here down below that way you guys can go and research a

featuring jazzasaurus butt tender from mother nature's remedy in woodland hills and the buddies brand cannabis distillate with cannabis derived terpenes vape cartridge so we'll be doing a review on this vape on the buddy's brand seesaw so today's strain is the three bears og this is an indica it's one that i personally am a fan i'm a fan of i've tried it in the live resin form i've tried it in the dab form but i have not tried it in the dissonance so i haven't tried this either um 91.98 total chem cannabinoids eighty-eight point fifty percent thc zero cbd and it has beta-mercing beta-carothylene [Music] we'll see okay i like these chirps i think i'm gonna like this one should be good three bears og pop it on open let's see what it's like buddy's distillate features the cso vape battery the seesaw hardware on the cartridge single source distillate and they do use cannabis derived terpenes which means that the terpenes comes from cannabis not some kind of all-natural or fruit or veggies or something like that three four second hit what are you tasting it was something sweet and earthy i don't know i really like it oh it does have that good like earthy og it's earthy sweet terps it's slightly sweet and it's smooth oh are you gonna get a turf sneeze no sneeze it's always good when the turkeys happen that's pretty cool that's a good idea potent flavor-wise you get a little bit of citrus on the end or kind of in the middle of hitting it on the inhale on the exhale you do get this sweet earthy oh genius i like it yeah i really enjoy this one 90 91.98 total cannabinoids this is considered hypodecy uh what are you thinking for a score out of 10 and why um 9.2 9.2 um i don't know i don't really get like a body height from this it's just i think it's a head high i think it's gonna become a creeper because og kush is always creepable creep on you a little bit if they don't hit you right away they're still going to get you higher still on their jeep um but i feel you it's really it's really earthy for me but i think someone who enjoys earthy will love this yeah there wasn't a lot of pine on it but there was definitely not like piney and sweets it's mercy so it's going to be more that sweet sour the caryophylline is going to be that slight earthy spiciness and then the osu moon is going to be again a little bit of citrus so i'm getting at least all those flavors which is nice manufactured on october 28th so it's still relatively fresh distillate the color is pretty beautiful i mean my score doesn't necessarily matter because i work with buddies but 9.2 from you 9.2 i feel is pretty solid i get it i'd give it somewhere around the same um this is the best strain i've ever had no but i feel like a lot of strains that taste the way that they're supposed to taste and they give you the high that people have said that they usually give you yeah whoever likes these turks is going to love this if you like oh geez this is going to be really solid for you it's probably going to be closer to a 10. i for one though marathon reviews my that's my favorite so i like the dream so i'm pretty basic i feel that i feel like well appreciate you guys for the love thank you jazzy for your review jpeg here coming at you guys live respect my region taste test review a whole new series dedicated to identifying whether or not this is worth

I'm not gonna lie it looks like there's pretty good stuff in there it looks super thick I usually [ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm so [ __ ] high it's not getting any better but hits are a little less intense though so that's giving me hope that this pods almost done if there's one thing I can say it's that the pod is in full effect right now I still stand by my statement that taking it dab of this amount would give me higher though I actually asked my battery's about to die and I feel like I got close enough that's what I'm gonna call the video I'm not gonna smoke any more of this so click like if you enjoyed I really did not enjoy this pot but if you enjoyed the video make sure you click like subscribe for more video it's got a lot more on the way leave a comment let me know a Q&A question for a future video but thank you guys so much for

today to do a quick taste test live resin vape review featuring the pineapple muffin live resin vape cart from orchid essentials so this is their gold live resin product line cartridge by pure tech project vapors are the world's first cannabis cartridges emissions tested at afner standards the highest standards in the world puretech ceramic is higher quality than competitors and offers superior flavor and user experience the pineapple muffin so we're gonna check this out i'm pretty excited because i've never had this brand before i was just introduced to it recently so it's gonna be just quite an experience so let's dive in shall we interesting enough i've been having trouble getting into some of the boxes oh there we go okay here we go so easy slide up nice big cartridge here check that out that's the oil and then just gonna twist it on to the battery that i have there they do have a custom nice powerful battery over here and then five four three two one you guys know the rules one hit wow off to the races with that one man that is delicious you've got this beautiful gold live resin inside there i can tell that it's not disliked because of the consistency and there's like this film over um you know over the glass kind of like housing for for this device um let's see taste on that first hit absolutely phenomenal i won't sit here and say that it was extremely pineapple but it was sweet it was piney it was earthy spicy citrusy and i'm definitely energized after that first hitting so second hit there it is there it is you really get that pineapple on the second one okay so 84.6 thc point two percent cbd this is a half gram uh cannabis oil cart delicious manufactured uh what is that july 23rd 2020 score out of 10 for the taste i gotta give it a really high score i'm gonna give it a 9.5 i need to know the terpenes to know what's going on somewhere here change it up make it smaller bigger whatever you got to do i got to know the terps and that kind of lets me know what exactly it is that i'm tasting otherwise it's a perfect score 9.5 add the terps to the back i know what i'm tasting it can for sure uh kind of prove what i have going on in my mouth the high that i'm probably gonna experience bam taste test through and through for that really good um there was a slight metally taste but i believe that it's just because of this battery being as powerful as it as it is so that would be 0.25 for the terps and 0.25 for the battery if there could be something different maybe there should be but i don't know at this point really solid experience very impressed score out of 100 i've got a number in my head already 95 on the taste test the packaging a little tough um one second draw cartridge contains 75 servings cannabis oil distillate and terpenes so ingredients it says cannabis oil and then in parentheses it says distillate and then it says and terpenes so is this live resin or is this a distillate in terpenes i'm not sure let's check the other one it says the same thing we could have a labeling inconsistency here um because of that i gotta give it an eight out of ten because now i'm confused and this would definitely turn me off if i were buying it because now i don't know for sure what it is if they don't know what it is i don't know what it is but aside from that 95 on the flavor the effects the potency the product appeal all those things very high but there is a major packaging and presentation issue going on causing me to drop the overall score to an 80 out of 100 so definitely be sure to tune in uh for more taste test reviews big shout out to orca you guys have a really solid item here let's figure out the packaging and get the numbers up and help the consumers understand what's going on at a higher level so they

is like my third hit i just wanted to start exploring the flavors at the beginning it was a really gassy diesel flavor you could tell like it comes from the east coast then at the aftertaste it's a really earthy kush like notes that you could feel like piney couch notes that's what the coach comes from the west coast if you actually know the history about chem dog and the strain it's like the seeds came from the east coast all the way to the west through the grateful dead great story so i'll follow up with this in the next few hours i'll tell you how guys how it goes have an awesome day

really really gassy you feel me like that decently with that that earthy after like piney skunky aftertaste um the only bad thing i have to say when you burn it like i'm burning like a 3.4 3.5 i don't get the kick that i want but anything other than that it will uh burn your throat other than that i would recommend it and i will buy it again i give it a point four seven point five out of ten

just I just I can't help it Semien brands like friendly farm alien web-connected cuz I know if it's new for me is new for some of you guys this isn't adventurous and experienced shut the [ __ ] up so very excited to let you guys know what I can't today what I can't today is being I don't want to say a controverse I don't want to say it's controversial because it's not controversial but it's a it's a topic of discussion here at the site when I saw that friendly farms was releasing a full gram cart which was knit which is a new thing for them you know what I mean which I had no idea I'm relatively new to friendly farm hindsight 20/20 if you don't have to sell the full grams don't you know what I mean like and the surprising thing is is that this was pricey but it wasn't you know it wasn't like the 50 $60 half gram and this is still connected cured residents now they were known for the live resin whenever they did to collapse this is cured which if I'm not mistaken and it doesn't take a scientist figure that out cure it I'm sure is what just cleaner live resin and it's one gram brand friendly farms came out with a 1 gram cartridge right now when I had heard of that I was just like damn I hope it's not as expensive as half luckily is really not as I think they actually lowered the prices this was $60 almost 70 same for the half gram the biscotti cross with gushers biscotti cross with gushers open this bad boy up and give it a whirl shall we man use my have a letter print the definite was some kind of you know message oh it's right here on the background you deserve better or just give you a happy force you know what I mean just quotes to make you feel a little bit solace right here on the event really fun and that's the one thing is I don't really know I'm many's that do that that gives you that little message so in a weird way thank you for that and giving me that validation family farm seriously sometimes we need the validation as human beings you

farms the actual family farms without the collabs but those collabs man like Oh Scottie Karl with gushers that's a relatively new strand that they came out with connected you know what I mean and this is for me like I love bass I feel like it gives you the actual taste of whatever that is whatever that strand is and I just I like to taste it you know what I mean I like to taste what it actually tastes like you know what I mean and this is everything I mean listen this is live residence it's all natural from plants a pen no additives distillate free distillate freak [Music] funny thing about the gushers and the biscotti strands of connected is the both have gelato because of the gelato 41 in the regular gelato that's oh my god there's four different crosses in this so it's really hard to you know for a person with a TD to really remember it all but look it up it's actually like a very interesting combination of things [Music] not too much on the dry bulb on is the biscotti Crossman

mine I made sure to come I was a [ __ ] to try to find though I'm not gonna front it was very annoying at first but I'm very happy that it worked out I'm very happy with the price point being $55 with

say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "rxiBPyFx8uw": "hi there

from ki relief by delivery order I paid forty eight dollars for this cartridge and it came in at an impressive eighty four point three percent THC or four hundred and twenty one point six milligrams this is another C cell cartridge with a ceramic coil that enhances flavor the flavor of this card on exhale is sweet fruity and piney onto the effects the first effect I felt was a cerebral Head busing sort of like tingly that quickly turned into a big old smile on my face that stayed through the effects plenty of happiness from within that also remained stronger inner joy than demand that music and dancing and my pain lower to a1 through the duration of the effects too it melts my excit and stress away like a blowtorch of calm and I also get very social and sadi when I'm on the effects can I work on the strain oh yes and GSEs one of those strains that I love to work on it makes my day a breeze by making me filled with energy or extra happy social and lowers my pain to a minimum I

hair for your [ __ ] man i think i'm done for the videos", "v7eQ8UTo-Ug": "howdy y'all Dan Scott lean here joining you from legal grass that she sits the heartland of America so for today's episode I'm going to be reviewing this Delta 8 cartridge yes Delta 8 not not the Delta 9 that you commonly associate with THC but there's another form of THC there's Delta 8 that comes before 9 and there's also Delta 10 but I haven't heard of any vendors creating Delta 10 carts at this moment in time right now so I'm just gonna be reviewing what I do have in my hands which is a Delta 9 THC cartridge from 3qi and I've plugged them before on this podcast but I've actually given this actual vape cart the the light of day I've given it a chance and Delta 8 I got it quacks very much like the same duck of cannabis they did it's it feels if you told me that this was a different form of THC I wouldn't I would have I would I would would think it's the same wing of the of the same bird and but yeah so I bought their purple punch Delta Delta eight cartridge that the particular cartridge has about 900 milligrams of Delta 850 milligrams of CBN and CBC and 50 milligrams of terpenes alright so I got this purple punch vape cart from from the folks of 3qi and so do this all right this is what this looks like 3qi this is the cart so you're gonna vape it right now in front of you guys if you look in the video version of this excuse me all right so I vaped it it's like any other vape card if you vape a little too much and you put a little too much we're taking a little too much vapor we are gonna get the coughs and that's what happened I mess with the rooster and got and got the beak but but now with that hefty sort of vape poll that I got you could you could taste the purple purple grape II sort of sweetness to it and it's very apparent in that and in this cart so does it does for taste and flavor it tastes like purple punch concentrates I've had in the past so it does hold up I feel high I don't feel the same debilitating high that a good edible would make me feel or even just like a job two bowls of a 2 2 full cannabis bowls smoking before bed that kid it packs a punch and does the the what I find with Delta Aid is that it feels I still feel the same body it effects of a that I would feel from a good indica I sort of I still feel the same sort of Medicaid medicated that I would with with regular teeth see um what I do notice is that the Delta eight by itself I just vape it by itself like it tends to fade very quickly or in my experience it like you feel the high but then it just it fades and I feel like it fades quicker than if you had had a regular THC count cart so I I do feel that the sticking power with the high in the duration of the highs is shorter with this Delta aid cart and with this Delta eight that I'm trying but I'm what I do notice when I combine it with my THC and CBD I do notice that my sleep is a lot better because I'm getting the anuradha fact and I do feel that Delta eight with Delta nine by itself I feel like it's a lethal combo for for my sleep like it's you take it and it's like oh man it's like I'm hitting the snooze alarm again like I feel that my suppli supplementation of Delta aid with that my Delta nine in my CBD I feel like that's done a world of good and for for treating my illnesses that works actually better than just typical Delta nine I've a fried CBN concentrated like I've like I've mentioned again didn't see the big ruckus in it but I put a gram on my flour I put no I put a little bit on my own flour I put a little bit when I would vape and I again I didn't really feel that much kick from cbn I didn't really feel that oh I'm so gosh darn tired I feel like I get more of a kick from a delta eight and then Delta nine and having that together I feel like I get way more doing that than just getting cbn pills or cbn concentrate which I've gone before and didn't really didn't really live up to the hype but this Delta 8 stuff like if you want a good sort of if you want to replicate that body high and you know you move to a new city or state and don't really have your connects like this is as close as you'll get to the actual THC without having it without having to take spice or anything like that you still all the hallmarks of a traditional high are still there it's just just a bit less intense and it just fades quicker like that's what I've noticed from taking this powerful punch and what I've evaluated over the course of a few days but what I do feel that we're gonna learn and what what people a lot smarter than me are gonna find out is that Delta eight and nine and when you combine it can work very very well when when when taken without Delta eight so Delta eight and nine complement each other very well I definitely feel the hallmarks of a traditional high without you know the without the sort of oh my god this is out of control Ness about it like you you feel high but it's a very sort of controlled high you know it's not it's not like a sound like a sativa edible or whatever that oh my god I'm high I'm high and I don't want to be high anymore pleases no I don't I don't know I don't feel that with Delta eight it's a very it's a very controlled sort of high doesn't feel too much different than a one I would say a one to one sort of strain might offer you a comparable experience my opinion where you feel both he feels M you feel sort you feel impaired but you still you still don't feel like it's out of control boy so I feel like that's what I feel like these are going to be like the new one to ones or maybe you'll have one part Delta a one part Delta nine I feel like that's gonna be the way of the future I do feel that you know for sleep having supplementing with Delta Aid and my THC I feel that the sleep I get is deeper when I sleep when I wake up I'm hidden snooze a little bit more often because the claudius lead that I'm used to getting under Delta aid definitely improves when I paired with Delta nine flower but yeah we've gone into what Delta eight is in previous episodes I would I would recommend you check out these cards they're the one milliliter card was honest aid after shipping was $65 or something like that so if you live in a state where the met both medical or adult use are still very new and still very expensive you may be able to come out ahead buying Delta eight cards as they continue as more continue to go in the market there's another vendor I just ordered four cards from that that's selling their cards for ten bucks apiece which is a lot cheaper than than what I got with three tree but um but again that's it's it's that's still in the mail now so when we get those cards were gonna review we're gonna review that vendor there are new vendor to so we're gonna be what among the first people reviewing it hopefully but yeah I'm if you want something that's gonna complement the medical reasons why you use canvas I guess let's say you use it for anxiety use it for whatever I mean we're all different you know CBD affects me different than it affects UTC affects me differently Delta eight will affect me differently or affect you differently but I do notice that it amplifies the qualities that I find so medicinal about about indicas and it complements that body hi that I need and I need to treat my illnesses and my symptoms in compliments that perfectly it doesn't make the hi out of control it's it's a good enhancer you know and and I find that I don't get like I mean I don't get as paranoid anymore with with with cannabis but I do find that with this Delta eight like it's it's it's kind of like CBD but not you know you know in a sense that it it's able to neutralize it but you are still gonna feel impaired compared to not taking Delta eight or Delta nine you like you're still gonna feel something it is it is gonna so pack a punch and you should understand how your body can handle it before handling heavy machinery but yeah I would highly recommend checking out Delta eight cards if you have the ability to do so again the entourage effect you know all these cannabinoids work better in concert as opposed to just in isolation so again if you have the cash you have the funds and have the ability to get Delta eight cards and you're looking for something that might enhance or amplify your body high from cannabis that you use to treat various different illnesses like if you're sewing in which the body high is needed or the effects that are granted from a body highs needed then Delta eight is gonna be your friend in my opinion I I will say that before letting you all go but yeah I would highly recommend you check out three tree & shaki to live in a state check to see if you live in a state where Delta eight can be shipped to you first make sure you do that before anything else and yeah um if you have the funds and you have the ability to do it and I would check it out so as always everyone I'm their humble and gracious hosts dance Scotland I can be found anywhere you find podcasts tune in google play store I heard radio radio public spotify stitcher tune in and the Google and an iHeartRadio

another review today's review is gonna be on another kart the venom X this one is the pomegranate paradise sativa so with uh with that intro already done let's go ahead and let you guys know that this channel is a smoking cannabis channel only so if you're not 21 and older 18 and 21 depending on your state you can't watch this video it's age restricted or some some some I don't know I don't know YouTube doing me dirty with this but sorry so well now we can start the review like I said so it's the pomegranate paradise it's the venom X this is the first venom X we've reviewed on the channel I did like a week or two ago have two venom X's they were actually the same exact one they were supposed to be different but the girl gave me the same ones for some reason so that was whatever but I just didn't make a video and I explained why in another video so go watch that one um but this one I don't think it says anything about like what percent it is oh no it does this is meeting with 100% all-natural terpenes C cell technology but bought 85% - you see right there in the middle marade there we got it on the doctor's odx battery here it's pretty well charged when I was when I got this it was supposed to be like really fruity that was supposed to be the flavor like a fruity kind of earthy taste but after hitting it for like the last few hours like a day like I've had for a day I notice that it's very very cush it's just straight clutch taste so if you like those go for it but the high on this thing is probably the happiest ha I think I've ever gotten out of any car especially or out of any sativa especially any card this thing just smacked me like in a good way and I was like fully chilling the whole time but I just felt really good I was in some good vibes you know I'm saying so I got like hair they're mangroves if you guys like sativas um and you really want to get like a really good happy high like feel great moment I highly recommend this car venom X pomegranate paradise it is solid for that I haven't felt that that like great high in a long time and this one definitely did it so let's go ahead and take one one good couch off this bad boy and yeah let me know if you guys are smoking anything down in the comments melesa interested to know so twos guys yeah I mean it I I will say there is like a little bit of a fruity taste maybe like pomegranate maybe a small hint of it but it's very cushy maybe a small hint of erythema like that that like weird you know the taste I don't want to say it's earthy but that's how everybody describes it but y'all know what the taste is but it has a little bit of those too but it's mainly cush to me that's at least my personal taste you guys might taste a little something different right sorry to me here like little noises in the back I just got a puppy I'm fostering and he's a little Brad so it makes a lot of noise I mean when yeah this thing's I'm already feeling a little little hot and body I already for sure head high a little a little bit I'm gonna feeling chill you don't here's the wax it's a really nice golden color beautiful background huh 10 out of 10 it is pretty solid they're pretty thick pretty damn thick no there was a deal it was a to 440 the homie uh-uh he the big the big homie got ice play with me so we went 20 20 and he got a cart shoutouts to him you got the same cart and I don't know how to say let's just shoot you another one guys cuz that's all I can say Oh yo so real quick so it's October right Oh in September Jesus Christ but it's September so it's almost Halloween to you that means that Halloween serials in season Nash it's the best so let me know which one's your favorite there's like Count Dracula or whatever the chocolate one a cocoa dragon track you cannot what it's called there's Franken berry and then Boo Berry let me know which one's your favorite I'm personally a Franken berry I think Don's left I think I was like tops for sure and then boo Berryman choco vampire [ __ ] whatever told mm-hmm but that's just me that's just me those are some bomb-ass cereals oh for sure for sure well well [ __ ] there is a little bubble right there and one thing I have noticed after hitting it when you do create a bubble like that inside the card it kind of hits off that bubble again so you kind of get like the weird battery like fume taste so it's kind of ideal if you can let the bubble move a bit that would be I that would be a bad deal but if not you know you can still get a pretty decent draw off it for sure for sure well let's take another one you choose yeah you know what I want to do for you guys I want to do a for one of the strings Saturdays or screen Sundays or whatever it is his move his battery's getting all my little one well for one of the streets after it is do like a Keith pre-roll or something like that like a full like Granberry Keith line or like a 3.5 grant that would be dope the I I'm not really ever smoked a chief joint at all I don't even know if Keith blunts it really made it often but I'm more of a joint kind of guy anyway but definitely man wow my lungs right there I definitely really want to smoke occasionally they look so fired or a moon rock a Zodiac moonwalk one of those those pre-rolls are expensive but I'm definitely found if you guys lend me one and see one of those I gotta find a dispro that hassle near me but I'm sure that'll be pretty damn easy I think that was three is that three yeah well I think yeah here she I'll kind of show you there's the bubble right it's just it got bigger it didn't like Oh to any other one I don't really know if he can do that maybe if I switch switch it a little bit if I open it a little bit more like not so tight no I'm saying it might be blocking a little bit of airflow let's see well I wasn't I feel like a lot more smoke and normal for sure Richard Oh ma'am that was interesting I don't know if I that was a good good idea or what I just I've always had it pretty tight so I just kind of loosened it so there's like a little bit more air fall but enough connection to get a hit yeah definitely hearing more air flow going through for sure well what interesting I'm gonna mess around with that a little more see how that works and see what happens there but I think that's a wrap for this video guys I hope you guys had a Wow Jesus Christ I am stupid I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did go ahead and give me a like or subscribe that would be awesome comments are always dope I always reply to all of them you guys are super dope on all the last ones you guys pretty much left comments on every single one except for like one which is totally chill for me but yeah I love to love the feedback so it's always good to hear with all that done and like for kids

to the basement [Music] yes what's up new to guess what man we back today and today we're gonna do a review on something a little different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few other companies I'm gonna try them all out you know I'll let you guys know exactly how this thing goes be back with you in a few feet", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a burrito - no yeah really am diabla okay so meet at the end and I really enjoyed all of these vapes thank you for coming out and for telling us all about them I think it's I think that you guys are doing an amazing job of an amazing products tank it taste is amazing it's really potent so please come back in some other time let's try some more so yeah I'll be back with our new products okay guys thank you for watching we have heavy hitters available on at Cod return calm you can order that in California and have it shipped to your door so check us out [Music]", "_GXrNZZnloI": "what is up YouTube family boy vaska's here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my videos if you got someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "tEsMD-d72_g": "hmm so hopefully this is centered guys but what's going on YouTube today guys I just wanted to make a quick little video because honestly it's been a long day so I'm not really like in the spirits to make a video but I do want to make a video you know I want to have a video made for you guys tomorrow because I've been keeping it consistent so this is my attempt to making a video on a lazy day well even though it's been productive so into the introduction to the video topic today guys I'll be showing you guys my favorite baddie battery baddie for short [ __ ] and then we're gonna be show it we're gonna be going into higher def of the Alpine live resin cartridges we're gonna be hitting both the gorilla glue number 4 and the true OG it's just gonna be a chill sesh imma be telling you guys what I like about these products and why I choose the stick it was battery over other batteries because as you guys know I have had the opportunity to try so many batteries as of late and they've been great there's been a lot of great ones there's been a lot of bad ones so I want to tell you guys why I choose this one over the other ones that I've tried so far so since it is already gonna be night time I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with the indica first I shot my head with the hybrid first gorilla glue number four and then we're gonna go straight into the true orgy right after we're gonna had a piece of lint in my freaking mouth so right here guys you got the girl the glue number four not sure if that's focused in or not but gorilla glue number four and got the battery fully charged dude so go ahead and screw that on here and man it's kind of hot it's it's spring time already yeah like I think it officially hit spring and it's starting to get hot the worm is starting to kick in man and it's finally not cold which is cool you know even though I enjoyed the cold I definitely didn't enjoy the days that it was so so freezing to the point where I had to be covered in two blankets but if you guys are 18 you know where 21 over make sure you guys are hitting this along with me let me know what you guys are hitting in the comments below man it has been a long day my mind it's kind of like scattered right now like I said I didn't I wasn't going to make a video but here I am for you guys the dedication and consistency so whose battery my resident Alpine gorilla glue number four cheers boys ooh there's so amazing about Alpine vapora has to have by far the best gorilla glue number four in the world dude they nail it to the point to the point and for sure so when taking another hit and then I'm probably gonna [ __ ] do you know I'm probably gonna just turn the air on for a little bit oh sure I just cracked the window it is a beautiful little day-out pledge crack the window a little bit this one too and we're gonna take another hit and I'm gonna tell you guys why I like this battery more than any other battery that I've tried so far so I'm actually packing it closes because there's people playing music and I don't want their music to overlap mine so just gonna have to stick with the air on us can barely hear anyways man that is amazing right already starting to sweat man these summer days these spring and summer days are so amazing it's definitely one of my favorite seasons to smoke in by far I do not enjoy any other season than summer scene the smoking like just being able to enjoy smoking at any place like outside especially dude that was the biggest hurt of the winter and the cold season I was not being able to smoke outside so onto the importance of this battery man so this battery it costed me I think 15 bucks I bought this myself this isn't sponsored at all by use this was a hundred percent me I went to go buy to smoke shop when I was waiting on some other batteries survive and they didn't arrive on time and I had some product knowledge like you know what I dude I'm just even go out and buy a battery because I want to hurry up and try this so I never go into my local smoke shop and they had this battery and it really stood out because I have seen I had seen him around but I thought they were just cheapy batteries and then honestly this was this was the best quality one at that smoke shop and then I was like you know whatever just give it to me give it to me 15 bucks isn't too bad so I bought it and when I opened yeah I was like I was like oh wow like it wasn't as cheap as I thought it was gonna be so I looked in like I got it looked into it and then the material is very very nice the finish is the kind of has like a matte finish they have different colors obviously I just chose the green because it was the best one that they had and one thing that I like about this the first thing that really caught my attention was the variable wattage is on the bottom the turn knob so for $15 the fact that you're getting variable wattage with a turn knob is amazing dude bad batteries out here charging literally 25 to 30 dollars for something like this and they're ugly they're fat batteries and this one is just so thin and so like clean looking and nice and it goes up um it's from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight so that's pretty nice who is you really did a good job man they have the little holes right here that you could put any cartridge on this no air flow airflow restriction will be added on so like I said man this this is a very very nice battery and this is why I like it over other ones because you could fit anyone it's stealthy light not like the other ones you know it's nice having it's nice having the other batteries that you can do cool stuff like the preheat function but when do you honestly need a pre heat engine if you're using a cartridge you should always have it upside upside no matter what or else you are already like not taking care of your cartridges because you as if you do know you're not supposed to be having them upside down because you're losing oil so girl Lagoon report amazing dude it gives you such a heavy and nice high actually not even heavy just such a nice high the the notes on it is very very piney very very like a little bit hint of citrusy but more of the piney scent and it's very amazing if you guys don't know gorilla glue number four is my favorite strain by far so we're hopping into the true OG a heavy indica right here oh gee for sure so slapping on the battery and then the for the Alpine you're supposed to be hitting them at 3.7 I'm hitting at this one a 3.8 even because that's where the little dot is that and we're going to turn off the air and then when they see what kind of how massive hits we get at this so true oh gee live resin here we go boys Cheers Oh yup I don't know about you guys but obviously every og is an OG for a reason right so but I don't know if this is just me but or if you guys can tell me but I taste in every og I taste this kind of a similarity which is weird because I've tried strains that are like have the same strain specific strain in it and it tastes different you know you can barely or you can barely even taste it so the fact that they can consistently get this flavor across although g-strings for me personally is pretty crazy but true OG definitely a heavy hitter man whoa just those little hits right there you got me free a super hit highs right off the bat it's a little bit more of a dirty or high for me I like the girl igloo number four it's perfect for me true og is definitely like yeah an indica a nighttime because I'm already feeling down luckily I'm not gonna drive after this I'm just be chillin at the skate park right now for a couple hours go to and then after that just go to Target get some waters go home get ready for work tomorrow continue the grind that continuous grind guys actually have homework to do tonight so we're gonna be doing that also so grind it all the time so cheers boys this is for the people out there working hard every day to make [ __ ] happen I got the water man stay hydrated all the time I've really been taking health until like into more of like way bigger dude way bigger I've been enjoying it a lot more I've even thought about getting into bodybuilding because I've kind of been getting bored of just going and lifting weights just to look good you know I kind of want to challenge myself and do something so I might be getting into bodybuilding I'll see what the world like how hard it is because I already have a hard lifestyle as it is so but that would be pretty fun I mean I'm six foot one six foot two whatever I don't know double check that but six foot two I currently weigh 210 and I want to be honestly at a solid 190 so but just really lean muscle so we're almost there I've definitely definitely been seeing the results like coming in and it makes me happy no consistency is key guys so we're going to take this last hit and we're gonna finish the video because I'm already faded off my ass and then so cheers boys hi I'm not gonna let it go I'm gonna talk over it so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys make sure to leave a like comment a sub don't forget to share with your friends do all that good jazz you know we keeping the positivity keeping the content coming the consistency every three days is kind of my schedule that I'm coming on right now which kind of works for me we got some big things coming up steezy big battery coming soon video moon rock coming video coming soon so imma ending here guys I'm faded I gotta go I hope you guys have an amazing day like I said again go make sure I hit that sub button if you're new here and have an amazing day lates", "gKZi4NlzUwQ": "a YouTube Alex here back again with another quick video this time I grabbed it a Lehrer cartridge I don't grab too much Alera but this bad boy las vegas triangle cush was coming in at 88 percent THC take a look at that 88 percent THC los vegas triangle cush this is a distillate vile era and 455 bucks for a half gram they i have had their cartridge once before i had the king louie and it was really good actually the hardware on their cartridges are nice and the bonus is it came with a free battery Alera battery for free this is the battery i just charged it up he's got the little thing with it the little battery comes with right here i charged it up it's a little battery i do got my kangertech for comparison you see the kangertech is way bigger and a little Alera battery that they give you for free came with the cartridge 455 you got the battery and the cartridge no i did charge up the battery fully and yeah so let's get it open did cut this tape to make it accessible quickly and boom of course nice looking cartridge look at that nice looking cartridge Alera cartridge really nice nice looking oil just to let you take off this little top rubber piece here and this little bottom rubber piece there goes the cartridge it's got air flow holes that you can adjust but you know what i don't even know how to adjust them says al error across the bottom now these cartridges hit i leave it wide open the way it is it comes wide open the air flows you can come wide open I guess you could somehow but when I tried last time I couldn't do it let's see their battery that's their battery they dare Cheers not bad but it started blinking I don't know if it's got a quick shut off time but that thing started blinking i'ma hit it again okay now that's got a quick shutoff it's got a five like a five second or three seconds shutoff which is kind of good it doesn't make you over burn your oil and wonderful that's different temperature settings one two three four one two three four five okay I see what's going on you hit the button hmm you don't have to hold the button in you hit the button and it stays on for like three seconds let's watch let's time it hit it it's on yep quick that's pretty good hope that three-second draw hmm you get a pretty nice hit so you can't adjust the temperature I tried to press it three or four in five times to see if there was a temperature adjustment there isn't all you do is press it once it stays on for three seconds and then it'll go off you gonna fight yeah see it's got a that's got a nice citrus taste to it valera Los Vegas triangle cush across the bottom there half gram cartridge it looks real nice I said it hits really good the hardware on it but you're not gonna be able to get a big hit because it shuts off after three seconds so if you want to get one of them dragging hits you know what I mean you're putting it on a different battery but I got my kangertech right here that I could use if I want to get like a 10 second or longer draw because yeah that's a good thing I guess because they're gonna save oil this way you know you'll conserve your oil visit a nice citrusy taste not overwhelming but that's what I'm getting it says it's a distillate pink 55 I told you that came with a battery I don't buy a lera too much but I did buy this one and I bought the banana cush cartridge also by Alera 1/2 gram cartridge so I might do a review on that when I might not this is the Las Vegas triangle cush 500 milligram cartridge eighty eight point zero one five THC no CBDs and yeah laris got good oil good distillate I just am NOT a big fan of their flour or their concentrates really and this concentrates good the cartridge but they're $75 they're charging for a gram of their wax or shatter and it's alright I guess their best product would have to be their oil cartridges because these cartridges are made minutes all steel it's got an adjustable airflow thing like I said but I like to leave it wide open to get the biggest amount of airflow and they hit really well and now they're coming with a free battery so you can't beat that 55 bucks comes with a battery and the cartridge Las Vegas triangle Kush it's hitting me I feel it coming on very nice very nice this is a hybrid the banana cush I bought is a indica you said I don't know if I'm actually going to do a review on that I didn't do a review on the hog plum haze I have been smoking that I still got some of that and I just finished that Moxie cartridge that's why I grabbed it another cartridge I like to have a cartridge along with my dabs you know to mix in the mix so yeah let me give it another rip Cheers yeah nice tastes good tastes like orange juice a little bit like a hint of orange juice that's straight and it's got good potency can't stick oil dick distally it's taking a minute but that bubbles moving yeah takes a minute no but it's taking a second to move I was just looking at a move and I'm actually blazed all right I'm out I'm gonna wrap this video up is getting to be too long it's already almost nine minutes yeah Alera lost vegas triangle cush right there nice cartridge hits excellent yeah definitely like it peace I'm out", "Fj5PoNrZ3OI": "welcome to community cannabis review today i'm going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel give this video a thumbs up if it was helpful if it wasn't then drop in the comments how we can

stands for botanical derived terpenes meaning the terpenes are coming from flowers so of course it's going to have a little bit more of a flowery taste there um comparatively to a cdt you know cannabis derived terpenes but it still has good flavor um and well good effect you know like i said before and so my other delta hc videos i feel like this kind of hits me a little bit faster excuse me than regular thc it's a very kind of heavy like back in the head type type of feel at first it kind of just like it just kind of feels like it's pulling you back a little bit um and yeah i mean

the more obviously you know you get tolerance you get a little used to it but the more i i just kind of learned to enjoy it more um i mean that's not to say i never enjoyed my first hit or nothing like that but yeah you know every delta a thc product i give you don't try out i'm more excited to get another one and give it a go give it a try all that stuff so for rogue or river labs i'm looking to try a cannabis derived terpene cart very soon so um for me this is the super sour diesel pretty good stuff i don't know personally whether uh i can discern between a sativa delta eight thc high and uh an indica one so hopefully you know i go grab an indica one as you know the cannabis derived terpene cart so that should be it for this video i do want to thank you guys for watching and tuning in and here's a little sneak peek at our next delta 8 thc video i did get a package in the mail so give me one second let me grab that thing here we are so might as well have a quick little unboxing

as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here

twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys

it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get well but hope you guys are ready for that Super Bowl if you got a Niner fans like this V no comment you know I'm a big man of fun as well hopefully we win it probably just a barbeque that day

welcome back everybody to a brand new video before before this video starts I just wanna let you guys know that I slapped on some sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple type you should hide Apple Express or some [ __ ] but you know you you just know you're getting the extract from this sharing or from some legit pineapple Express you know the book is lit man if you guys owe a good thing I would I would totally recommend this brand and this these cartridges it's like cartridges especially if you guys don't want to if you don't wanna like hotbox your room or some [ __ ] you guys are burning like in the bathroom real quick you guys have a quick sesh you know cuz the smell isn't that strong there's no like stick to it like rock gardens oh my god they have like a crazy like leafy it's it's a [ __ ] it's it's a strong a smell on the other [ __ ] you know they have they have strong smells of [ __ ] down [ __ ] late cuz I do not shut the [ __ ] up I got a chatterbox anyways you guys thanks for watching like always soon everything we have

I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments below to spread the knowledge

distillate um disposable cartridge all right i'm i got some [ __ ] to do today so with me on the go and uh yeah i guess let's i'll let you know uh how it is whenever i get back home all right thing right here is [Music] it doesn't have much of a taste just mainly this lit is what i'm tasting so yeah alrighty youtube just getting back uh been a long day just want to give you guys uh a little summary on this this cartridge right here um so after smoking it a little bit today and giving it like uh my thoughts i will not be buying these again i do not care for the taste it's nothing uh it's nothing like grapefruit haze um yeah i could just straight taste distillate right off the top it is something nice for on the go i just don't taste the grapefruit i don't taste the haze all i taste is this lit so um i don't care for these these things i don't care for any of this like cart to be honest with you so i mean if you're into this list and go pick them up but if not if you're if you uh like me you like the liquor live resin cars and stick with those my honest opinion is that these things suck sorry but uh anything with this lit i mean i don't know it's just my opinion um yeah waste 30 bucks but you know i wanted to get it to review it here it is guys uh it's not really much i can say about it it does the trick uh it definitely made me feel sleepy a little bit today but other than that i don't know if the sleep was just from lack of sleeping last night or from like if this is a indica strain i didn't even look it up so if you guys want look it up leave it in the comments grapefruit haze is the name of it all right grapefruit haze but yeah other than that i'll pop it one more time for you and then i'm gonna go take a shower and go to bed cheers [Music] so i don't care for it at all i don't care for the taste yeah so there you have it boys ladies and gentlemen uh virio brands they're [ __ ] disposable travel distillate cartridge grapefruit haze gets a [ __ ] out of a zero out of ten rating it gets a [ __ ] three from me i won't be mine again like share subscribe all that good [ __ ] i'm at this [ __ ] mom i love you peace [Music] you", "QHUzBlDY0CQ": "[Music] what's up professor G the hemp man today we got a special treat we're looking at these new CBD distill it be bait cartridges from black tie CBD no terpenes or cutting agents have been added to this at all they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and these effects come on instantly as do most vaping products for me and I would find this particular cartridge to be a hair on the night time you can't I wouldn't reach for this during the day for whatever reason so that mellows me out nighttime cartridge hit me with the comment below if you've tried these let me know what you think peace [Music] [Music]", "A3ZFodq2bIY": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but

fire", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for us to review if you'd like to learn more about heavy hitters you can check them out online and you could also ask for them at your local dispensary I hope you

just trying it there's no reason truly for me to use it it's just for trying purposes and let me let me show you so basically what i got first i ordered it from a specific site that i'll put all the information down below because i don't remember i've been ordering stuff online like crazy hotcakes i've been ordering online i have packages stacked upon stack so i don't remember exactly it's like cbd pure i don't know i'm gonna put the link down below from where i got these but they came in separate packaging from their own specific company like i bought it from this site but it came from the

much more money okay so this is the vape pen i believe it says and this is the bubble gum honey bubble gum flavor pure and clear so i got this because it doesn't have like all those types of i don't know explain it it says no pg or vg that's a type of ingredient they use that's supposed to be not good for you and i heard so i don't know i just got this this is organic hemp slim and lightweight adjustable heap settings preheat functions vape pen hemp oil concentrate cannabis derived tested pure blah blah blah mind body spirit fast acting really so this is 250 milligrams and this is 200 milligrams this is not bad for 20 200 milligrams for like 500 puffs or something i said i don't know but this is 250 milligrams what does it mean to experience pure spectrum enlightenment intuition creativity compassion vitality relationships and grounding this is like chakra status guys this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "wnUT4-HbKog": "what's up guys this is Nick from disk have a pen and today we're going to tell you about the difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you liked the video give us a like subscribe and if you want any of these products available for purchase you can check us out at discount vape pen com [Music] [Applause] you",

this attachment obviously it comes with this attachment I'm in the piece itself so I felt like that was a pretty good deal the ash catcher was a honeycomb had one honeycomb so he gave me $5 off you know but it ended up being to get a good deal alone so basically $100 102 dollars you want to be exact hundred or two dollars for the whole setup yeah let me know what y'all think up [ __ ] I thought

little raspy right now I went to Six Flags yesterday and it got really bad but hope y'all could hear me I have another dispensary cart and it is bright labs look at that guys this is from California and it is Mendel breath it is an indica and it comes with five hundred milligrams which is zero point zero 18 ounces total and 325 milligrams of total THC which is 65 percent zero zero five milligrams of CBD which is zero one percent and if you look at it guys they come in a really nice cardboard packaging really thick and there's a doobie tube inside I just finished dosey dose of bright labs right here guys I'll tell you right now the oil on these cartridges it is a little bit dark but it's it's on fire you ain't got to worry about these being dark though because this is a dispensary career so it like supposedly said whole plant cannabis extract so whatever they get off the plants what they put in the cartridge no additives no nothing and see if I could still get a little here has a little bit left shout-out to vo-tech for this battery very amazing if you haven't got a battery yet or you're looking for a better one I definitely recommend um the vo-tech Osiris I think or siren song like that buzzy Cheers very smart it but it's some fire guys like bright lads I still got two more steep odds right here so these will be next but these for some reason I just like them really like a lot so I wanted to do another review on the next one but on the bad guys it tells you manufactured by bright labs you can find them on Instagram as bright labs and then wwr labs calm you can go there as well and the back it says clean natural whole plant cannabis extracts lovingly crafted with botanical inputs from top farms across Northern California ingredients a hundred percent kind of a soil that's it that's all that's in there and then it tells you the government warnings about you know being 21 or older eating older breastfeeding when pregnant or whatever your all that stuff driving under well vaping this isn't good I might as well do it at home or whatever and the warning of cancer and reproductive harm for vaporizing use only do not ingest orally or apply topically there it is this white seal right here is the sticker that's holding the top together and then there's one here with I'll tell you right now with the dis tested lab results and everything if the batch number is l10 866 date manufactured was eleven nine twenty eighteen package on twelve twelve twenty eighteen it was tested by CW analytics the test date was eleven twenty eight of 2018 and this cartridge will expire on 11:28 of 2019 so when you buy one of these cartridge guys you still have a four years so if you don't get so here you lose it go find it somewhere between a year you'll still be good and then the California license numbers CD pH - zero zero zero zero zero four three five right there at the bottom is this purple sticker because well holds this with a barcode look at that and then it holds this together so you either gotta rip it or you got to open the seals from here but me I'll rip it cuz it looks just like a book which is pretty nice cuz everybody tell you some inside see look at it comes like a little book and it says our whole plant cannabis extracts preserve the full spectrum of terpenes and other compounds are found in each strain for an effect that's closest to smoking flower Oh got that flower right here guys look at that so they're vapes are meant to taste just like the regular flour no additive flavors like all those Dinks or anything like that it's just straight to the point seeing it says right there no additives or fillers or you at the bottom comes in the white do we do with the California's symbol right here with the weed sign I hate my voice right now guys I'll tell you right now thank you guys so much y'all made me hit those 2000 subscribers the giveaway is coming soon I just got it CBD chief sent me something I don't know if you I've seen them they're on Instagram they're a new company they sent me the starter kit that they made for CBD right here I will I will be reviewing this soon is just is meant for like you know the sticky paws are the jewel bars I think because look at that guy's two empty ones at the top charger in the battery we'll be reviewing this soon if you know I don't need it I won't be using it as a giveaway as well they only sent me one but you know hopefully if I get in talk with them again I do have a discount code so after the review of you I want to go by one you could just put go to their website and put that no just put hyper anything for twenty and I think you get like ten percent off so if you want one just use it guys cuz you know ten percent off is something but back to the review do be to the cartridge inside all you got to do is just squeeze it pop it open card your slides out I'm gonna make sure there was no leaks you had no leaks inside and look at this guys this is a point five coaches look at this oil compared to even have any other cartridges but compared to like excuse me compared to like any other cartridge that you would think of look at this oil but look they're all you don't move look at any moving at all guys this is what they say right here no additives no nothing just whatever they got this is the older they probably got and look at it there is no leaks on the little kind hole so I know that this is the color of the overlay put in here the only thing that sucks look how much I'm missing I'm missing a pretty damn good amount right there and I haven't even tried it with this one the other one that I had word I put in here I think it just loved it yeah well with this one guys the bubble on this one was so big that I was pretty pissed cuz it felt like I lost like a point two or 0.3 no maybe like a point too but if I like I lost a lot of it cuz it was really low when I opened it and I was pretty sure he leaked but didn't have no leakage signs so look at this one it's missing a little bit as well I hope they can just you know if there if they're telling you're buying 0.5 I I expect 0.5 not like a point 4.3 does the only didn't need to work on but otherwise right labs the cartridges of fire guys if you're in the local or you're in California and you haven't tried them definitely recommend them but let's see seal at the bottom take it off these have a ceramic white tip and the RC so at the bottom it says Jupiter with the symbol C cell and then it's a L four five eight but does it at the bottom and it has a little white you know a little seat through grommet right inside here just like the thing cartridges they got should be looking for it is the same thing except these are jupiter-c cells I'll just pop in my little magnet on the cartridge for the vo-tech battery and look look at this battery boom cartridges in you can even as well unscrew this off but the cartridge is viz you screw it back on either way and then you just Cheers whoa ooh buddy that was a good hit I was a pretty good that was a pretty big draw with this veal battery whoa look at my eyes is of the first hit it made me kind of tear up a little bit but really smooth and I'll tell you right now really strong really potent oil bright labs most likely they're doing the thing they're really good I also like the cities' but some reason these just do the job better let's go for the second hit but the taste right now it just tastes like weed like regular weed like if yours just smoking flower and you don't really taste any other thing which to me is my favorite which is tell me is my favorite flavor let's go for another here guys Cheers - bug definitely tell you right now the hi I have to give it a 10 out of 10 it made me tear up twice and I'm really big I'll tell you right now I got me really relaxed kind of sleepy again it's kind of early over here but I got me kind of sleepy as well and made my eyes feel really low like a barely keep them open they look open to me but I could barely give a woman they got me high as [ __ ] guys so now high cannot attend the flavor guys to me because I like the flower flavor I got to give it a 10 out of 10 they're spot on the only thing bright labs needs to work on is just please you know just give me my 0.5 does it does all I want you know I've seen like gram cartridges like the dr. zodiac moon rock which I have the empty carts right here this is slap for this pure 100 was almost left for had a small bubble but that that's a pretty big gap so that's all I want just you know brave labs all you got to do is just just give people their point five oil don't don't shorten them a little bit cuz this one really sucked but I was missing a lot and then to be missing a good amount on here that doesn't make it any better so 38 guys just to get a little bit more baked but to tell the truth right Labs mendel breath it gets the four 10 out of 10 on everything so 20 points gotta do this for the the clipboard whoo but right here Bray Labs 20 points really good third hit just to get more baked cheers guys hope you have been smoking with me thank you for everything I've done for this channel and for us so they just keep going with this boom let's keep doing this I got more dispensary cards coming anyway so stay tuned man some really good oil hmm every hit I'll tell you right now the name of this train

has a found out about me let them know and you know I still do think videos is just I lean off and on about them but just stay tuned comment down below like and subscribe and stay hi guys cheers again see you on the next one [Music]", "rIFOf4R1oyA": "you know what is going on YouTube welcome back to a quick little banger by your boy semi g-men so a question that I've been getting ass lately a lot men so you guys know that I've always upload a cartridge videos pata videos anything that has to do with a portable you know dabbing device then I'm pretty much using it because I'm always on the go I can never find a convenience to just roll down I mean sit down and roll one up you know or sit down and just heat up my mic to my banger or you know all that stuff so I always feel like I carry a cartridge or a pod with me at all times just because it's that convenient so but the question that I get asked a lot right is which one do you like better semi which one do you like better man you're always chief in this chief in that do you like cartridges better or do you like pods better and I was just like when when I saw that question I was just like wait hold on man I had to think about it I was like I don't know I don't know if I like cartridges or pods better you know I don't know which one I would choose on because I have had some really really amazing cartridges and then I've had some really really amazing pods you know and I feel like each one has their own you know up side to it so I think for today's video man we're gonna get down to the bottom of what I like out of a pod system and what I like out of a cartridge system and I guess so today though we are gonna be chiefing representing the 510 thread cartridge side we got imperial extracts this one right here is a lemoncello sativa and the main reason I wanted to put this one in is because lemoncello is one of those strains that is super freakin fire right now so I wanted you to give this one a shot shout out to imperial extracts mint for it you should handing this out to me and on the pot system side we got the big boy right here that's dizzy sitting on the nice big battery all right men shout out to Steve and I thought you know these two brands right here man they they make some really really good light resin so I chose some of the best ones that I could find and I just really want to see what what what makes it stand out more than the other all right guys so to start off I feel like let's start off with imperial extracts sitting that I think we're gonna put this out a three point five right lemoncello that's going what do I like about a 5-10 thread cartridge let's find out oh dude that is so smooth oh that libraries and hits though oh okay so off of that first initial hit I'm obviously not gonna base it off of the oil itself it's gonna be more about the cartridge and what I like about it so I think as the first thing the most obvious reason that I like a 5-10 thread cartridge over a pod would probably have to be you see this thing right here the battery man the fact that I could switch up my variable wattage is on a you know when I'm smoking if I tend that cartridge is something that is very very underestimated a lot of people do not know you know I preached this a lot when I'm doing cartridges and things like that but you have to if you feel like you're not getting the right amount of turps the right amount of flavor smoke whatever the cases the chances are you had to switch up the voltage side there go a little bit higher a little bit lower you know you go you have to find the sweet spot on a cartridge just so you can get that overall well you know smoke experience man when you're sitting there you're gonna get the the right flavor profile you're gonna get the Terps up smacking you get the smoke and I feel like when using a battery like this like this battery that has variable wattage right here on the down on the bottom I feel like that's a big upside to the 510 thread cartridges because men I I want it if I feel like it's not hitting enough I can easily turn it up and boom I'm getting smack because it feels like I just took a dab all right so that would be the first thing that I like about a 5-10 thread over a pot and next up on the list we got the stage right here like I said competing for the pod side and let's go ahead and take a little rip about this see what I like about the pod see what I like it but I don't like about it right choose or what I like over the 510 thread smackers dude I don't know it's dizzy so good but the imperial extracts man I think that lemoncello that they made Veneto bro finito so what I like about a pot I feel like what the thing that stands out to me the most about ippolit system it's just about the convenience and the sleek design that they give you I feel like that is the first thing that stands out to me right then no hands you don't have to push a button to draw this like you can do whatever you want with your hands while you're hitting it so I feel like that is the most upside about the about a pod system itself is the fact that you know you don't need to use press a button to hit it you just need to pull men in the designs at that you know they'd be coming out with with the paws system it's just the fact that you have a proprietary battery so you can really match it up and make it look very very appealing so that would be the first thing that I like about the pause systems is just the convenience and the visual appeal so back onto the cartridge side man I'm getting smack Manny I need to do some water boys don't forget summer is coming up man getting hot you guys need to stay hydrated all the time right so what's going on a 3-point boo it wasn't at three point eight holy shoot damn dude I think the first hit that I did was a three point eight so let's go ahead and now hit it a three point five and tell you what else I like about cardizem whoo that is fire dude it's so freakin smooth that I forget how much smoke is actually in my longings in their eyes like choking up so whoo yeah lemoncello definitely is I feel like the next thing that I would want to speak on about the 5/10 third cartridges are itself is I don't know what it is but I feel like I get a lot more flavor from cartridges of themselves because I've had I I can't remember what company it was exactly I don't even think they're around anymore but they went from putting it in a 5-10 thread cartridge and I remember tasting it it was so freakin good and they made the switch over to a pause system because they wanted you know hop on the wave up on the Uni style that was coming out and it just did not taste the same it did not taste the same I do not know if it has anything to do with like you know the build that 510 thread cartridges have as opposed to this one I mean at the other day they feel like they're both pretty similar you know they both have wicks in there ceramic whatever blah blah blah but I always feel like whenever I'm hitting a cartridge it's just a whole different type of like hi than I'm getting a whole type of different experience and then when I hit a pod system it's just it's satisfying for a short amount of time and then I feel like it's just I just get tired of it so that's why I'd rather choose a 5-10 thread over a frickin pod system goes one thing that I think both you know both the pod system and a 5-10 thread cartridge have their you know their negatives also so I don't know if you guys know but when you get to the bottom of a cartridge I there's always a little bit of oil up and in the pods it's significantly less as opposed to 5 10 third cards you can either way you're still losing oil it gets stuck up up at the top and I feel yeah that's maybe something that both a pod system and a cartridge system you know can both fix because with the with the holes right there it's the same thing as a pod it has a small hole right there and there are times where you just get stuck in the little crevice in between the cartridge and the hole so that's kind of a downside of both of matches [Music] dude I don't know they nailed this flavor like I keep talking about this imperial extracts cartridge but it's actually so satisfying it's my first time ever trying this limoncello it's like this is gonna be my daily driver from now on for sure screech this guy's discreteness is something that a lot of people have to deal with now it is because they don't want people knowing what they're doing and I don't know I guess nowadays everybody knows because it's 2020 you know you can't really if they see it they are gonna know automatically what it is it's been all over the news you know the cartridges have been blasted literally all over the news so people know exactly what it is so there really is no keeping it discrete but if you if you somehow find a way I feel like the most one to keep discrete would probably have to be this one because you could kind of pass off if you put it on a little on the slimmer batter you can maybe pass it off as a jewel you know take the little California weed sticker on and then boom there you go it looks kind of like a jewel and there's something they actually do have paws that are actually very very clear so you know it kind of pulls you a little bit closer to the Julian type of [ __ ] so you can pass away with very very you know look at being very very discreet is what I'm saying at the end of the day it's actually really really hard to choose which one I like better you know paws versus cartridges but if I really really had to choose I think I would just have to go with a cartridge itself like I was saying because you can endlessly switch variable wattages on this one man the hits the hits on a cartridge just hit way different as opposed to a pod man my experience is you know I'm a big long time cartridge user so it speaks for itself man it speaks for itself cartridges are you know my go-to I know that's really crazy to say and people always talk [ __ ] to me about like you know I do why do you smoke so many cartridges and like I mean now now in 2020 I've actually you know slimmed it down quite a bit I've actually been smoking a lot more deaths and I'm weed but before that I was cheating on a cartridge almost I was going through cartridges literally like two to three days but that's how crazy it was so yeah I guess 5-10 thread cartridges wins for me of us over pot systems don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with the good old pot system you know they do their thing they come in clutch when when they need to so with that being said guys 510 thread being the winner let me know in the comments below what do you guys think which one do you guys like a better DEA's like 510 thread or do you guys like pods and yeah let me know if you guys have ever tried imperial extracts especially this lemoncello man is super freaking fire so I'm gonna go ahead and end out the video here if you enjoy the content do me one last favor and hit that like button comment back to me and most importantly smash that subscribe button alright guys catch you guys on the next one", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "pvWD7CcSSOI": "yo guys what is going on and ship boy Cam Cameron whatever the [ __ ] you want to call me we are back with another cartridge review and today's cartridge review you saw the last video you got a sneak peek on this one today this is gonna be the same old brand right item nice lab but this one's great so you know if he no cards green usually means what hybrid that's right we got a hybrid right here we got tranquil elephant Iser what kind of string is that I have no idea but I'm very excited I usually don't get hybrids on this channel if you guys have seen some of my videos I say eight out of ten of them are sativas are in because usually the other two tend to be hybrid sometimes but you know usually it Vic mixes up between sativas and indicas only for this one yes hybrid I can't talk I'm pretty stupid and it known as a hybrid when it bought it because I bought it online because like this coronavirus you had to do curbside pickup and pretty much every dispensary around the valley for me I'm sure it's the same with you guys so I just saw the name and I'm like wow shoot that sounds cool as hell let me get it and that's what it is like kind of low-key expected this one to be at the indica honestly because I don't put you to sleep or something I guess not this is the hybrid one I do want to try an item 9 labs sativa that is I'm sure that one's gonna smack hard also we're at 1100 subscribers so shadows so you guys you guys have been killing it even when I wasn't here the sub rate just kept going up and up so I appreciate that you guys are the reason I keep doing this y'all keep supporting me so I keep doing this for you keep spending my dirty money so yeah let's get right into this um so same packaging is the last one obviously come to this little dude to blame things on 30 popped open cute got my charger I charge it on the computer 18x I mean it's not full charge but it will be a job right now here's the blacks you guys trying to show you that it's pretty clear it's a good size bubble right there she's nice clear wax I'm trying to get sponsored by just anybody in the marijuana industry right now I've hit up a few local growing companies like copper State Farm stuff like that hit up a few dispensaries I go to on a local a local regular basis around here so we'll go ahead and we're gonna keep trying see if we get any sponsors anything like that I don't expect anything like nothing from zodiac doctor so yaks or anything like that that would be super sick uh shots - dr. zodiac if you're watching for some reason also if you guys know any companies that might do a little you know small content creator sponsors like partnership kind of things let me know in the comments or you know shoot em an email give my answers my youtube or whatever it is I would love to make something happen that'd be really cool even if it's like rolling paper company or whatever it might be that B's that'd be dope um excuse the messy hair you know can't can't be a video with me if it's not messy hey so let's go ahead and take the first hit of those guys um I will for what drink oh if a nice tranquilizes or tranquile something like that so choose good mister one um so right off the RIP the first hit it's a lot more fruity for sure it's definitely a lot more fruity than the indica one i just had Wow my drink ready it still got that earthy taste kind of tastes like a DAB almost um the last card I had a pink champagne that one every time I hit it I got the taste of it actually dad I guess solid dab and is actually pretty nice it was a good taste to have so that was a nice one in the car today's hydration free I can't even talk to his hydration drink of choice Capri Sun you already know the Flies you know we [ __ ] lost some Capri Suns yeah so again here's the cart I'll show you guys the legs not moving if any of you guys know at least they're from Arizona I don't know where these guys are at other than Arizona item 9 Labs has some high-quality packs and concentrates and stuff like that pretty sure they have flour as well and I'm pretty sure that some high testing flour as well let's do another go ahead I'm not even like slowing to anything I'm just stupid just uh let's go ahead and do another one guys here we go see we're taking somebody's on ones here that Bobo starting to move a little bit cuz the wax is a little warm this this pen has a tendency to get very high very fast rate around here so no no no reason it shouldn't be moving well definitely a little intake to another hydration break hopefully guys since you guys been killing with the subscribers I've hit the subscriber goal to monetize my videos the only thing I'm missing is watch time so I just I have to wait and just get a bunch more people to watch my videos and watch as much time on my videos as possible because I'm still missing some of the hours but once I Cathy map of hours are required I can monetize my video and I can start making a little bit more money or a little bit of money off youtube and then if I make money off youtube I can put that towards carts and flour and stuff like that to make more videos to make more content for you guys and then they get more money from that and then I just put more towards weed and then it just it's a vicious circle and you guys get more content I get more weed more videos come out every just it's a win win win so hopefully that that comes in pretty soon but yeah we're still a good amount of time away from that so hopefully by the end of the year that's the goal but hey you never know so I do like this one so far I think I like the pink champagne one better though if you guys are gonna pick one of the other I would say that one pink champagne but I still have one more hint to give before I get my final judgement because you already know 3 or Nothing no sometimes more never less though so guys well that's one see we take three solid hits we don't take policy heads you know actually guys you know I don't I don't hate this car hydration break some [ __ ] you know this car definitely gives a high high you know what I didn't tell you guys I think you're still here the potency only this comes coming in at 89 89 percent so if you guys stick to right stuck around then chesty it's another potency level so that's about it so if you guys are still hearing I appreciate it you guys are the true viewers the choice for your shoutouts to guys you're amazing other than I hope you guys are staying safe well excuse me hope you guys are staying safe staying healthy just staying indoors right now there's the best thing you can do I just smoked a lot of weed just chill out so one time you're allowed to do this so yeah I'll catch you guys on the flip thanks for watching I'll see you in the next one thisis", "brhGc2_hAGw": "[Music] what's up homies and we got here and I'm freaking out it has everybody up

the [ __ ] Walmart probably any damn where ain't nobody gonna say [ __ ] so you think I'm just thinking you're hitting off of a dude while you're here look like seaweed my hair looks like [ __ ] see you even why was you up damn mama second on this long barnacle down yo dad would you smoke weed forgive your guitar Fruity Pebbles hell yeah I'm uh my last channel I had a strainer view on some fruity pebbles what even is DMT oh that's the easiest way I can explain it to you man is what your brain produces to make you start having dreams and stuff like that so whenever you're dreaming you're pretty much in like a DM teacher it right there but I've seen Joe Rogan and a bunch of people talk about it and I said that whenever you're dreaming you're producing like but as a [ __ ] and my phone's producing an acid log DMT way more than you would can smoke or whatever I'm thinks what they were saying it's what you do with it is I've seen them smoke it too but I haven't smoked it before you put a bowl of somebody then you put a little DMT and then I think you put another little bit of butter over the top of it so you don't actually get the flame on it but you get the Ember from the bud to burn it or something like that and then you just [ __ ] blast off I never seen anybody [ __ ] up on and I think I watched uh I think they might have smoked it on that drugs Inc [ __ ] or something like that whatever [ __ ] I was watching but um I looked like the meat the [ __ ] just knocked out and just like pretty much went to sleep for like 10 to 15 minutes and then came back yeah where's my phone is on 12% right now the CBD actually gets you high [ __ ] man whenever I smoke CBD stuff then while the [ __ ] knock me into damn head but it's like different from like if you smoke the bowl of Bud and you smoked a like a dab card or some like CBD pen or something like that it's it's a different high but you still feel something you know I'm saying but it's I will say it's different but it's not like you're hitting it like you're hitting some [ __ ] fake [ __ ] it ain't gonna be like you're like man hey I'm just smoking [ __ ] nothing really you will actually feel get like a kind of a body little thing going I want to drive my hair shut up and it's hard to take care of it oh and is it hard nah man any really hard to take care of it the only thing that's a [ __ ] to do is to try it

before so if you actually want to know lineage to go back to that that review and yeah so anybody read these numbers off real quick THC is seventy four point eight th CAS at 0.35 I think they had that backwards I think the thta's that are you take C's at 0.35 M th CAS at seventy four point eight but anyway a c BG 2.25 c bt a 0.55 CB z 0.99 in total seventy eight point nine for the terpenes a C alpha pining 0.59 I'm reading big ones here beta mercy three point seven [Music] Deveney 1.02 and see turpentine years ago on 5.21 had to go in there anyway the total terpenes on this is fourteen point seven okay here's a quick look at that stuff there guys it's kind of hard I'm in the car the way if he's driving on the way at Walmart real quick I just want to get a couple puffs in before uh I go in this craziness yes I know you guys can't see [ __ ] bumping and driving I'm just gonna crack this baby open and get to it alright see they put they put a new new little sticker on it's not those little white things anymore some plastic brown johns now right I couldn't very good turned on I got the [Music] yeah it's not not as hard I actually broke a lot easier than the other little stickers on let's see nice nice color nice golden color the the cards are just always the same I have no complaints about these cartridges I like them only only thing is I wish that it would come with like some kind of plug for the top that way uh you know you don't get [ __ ] [ __ ] in it whenever you put it in your pocket so with that said take this one off here of course got the crest good battery yes dude I teach real quick I know it's a hybrid I believe it was in the cat dominant I believe I know you for it helps a pain stress depression all that good stuff like like it always does you know I mean so without further ado be safe guys State Police say troopers here at Walmart I don't know why but yeah Cheers right here the Popo Wow very close very greenery it's almost reminding me of the

Cresco Hank rest goes [ __ ] my number one husband now for about a month or so maybe even longer so subscribe if you have not ready you heard what she said like make sure you smash that life subscribe all that good stuff share whatever page 420 out", "1nJ6qi4T_hQ": "all right guys so now that we are home man it's time to start this video guys we ended up stopping by the store getting ourselves a little uh gatorade zero because it's kind of hot today not gonna lie and i got some heat man i got some heat or at least what people in the streets are calling you know they're calling me they're like they're like yo sebby there's this new product out man that i think it's pretty fire i think you should try it and i was like all right what is it man i'm gonna go cop it let me know what it is so i ended up to i ended up going to carpet downtown l.a and we got it right here in the supreme bag boys you guys already know the vibes let me go ahead and take this thing out show you guys first hand what we got all right boys wrong one so um pretty much this brand is in literally every single legal dyspo that i know of at least the really really really big ones all right guys so getting straight into this one we got a new company man a new company called new normal right so basically what it is it's a new pod system that's out and about and i've heard nothing but good things about it so but the main thing that i've heard about this system itself is that there really really really consistent when it comes to their thc percentages okay so i have two pods right here for example the one that i've been chiefing on just to test it out because i like to test things out before i actually make a video on it because if it's not good i really don't want to make a video on it all right boys so the one that i've been trying was um they labeled it they labeled it as sleep and it is grand daddy perp it is a one full gram and the thc percentage is going to be sitting at delta nine thc okay 90 thc must say that the packaging is actually very very child proof it's very it's actually super nice hard to get open all you got to do is i'll press the button boom there you go all your stuff is in there i'm going to be showing you a brand new pod all right so gorilla glue number four this right here guys is one of my favorite strains okay if you've been following the channel for a long time you already know that gorilla glue number four is one of those strains that it's just like it's just so fire man it it might not be the most fruitiest you know most terpius strain but if it's a really really good gorilla glue it just hits the spots on so many different levels and it's one of it's definitely one of my favorite strains of all times all right guys so brand new packaging you just take that off right there this one right here like i was saying super consistent right so this one is sitting at a 90.65 thc right so gorilla glue number four same thing as the last one go ahead and pop it open like you're giving someone a ring and then boom instructions you could check scan the qr code it just to check if it's real man if you guys ever go to dyspo i'm pretty sure they let you scan the qr code just to double check that you guys aren't getting any fakes and boom you take it out of the little packaging oh they got like some saran wrap on it or something that's something new bottom you have the little plug right there take that off take the saran wrap off and then you have another one right here on top all you got to do is just take that off and then you got your full gram right here all right the oil you i can see right through it honestly it's actually really really clear hopefully that focuses up for you guys that way you guys can actually see it and like i was saying i got the battery itself right here okay the battery honestly this battery is actually really freaking dope in my opinion it is a usb type-c so that means that it's going to charge really really quick i mean before this video um i actually put it i actually had my portable charger i put it to charge and it charged in what like i want to say like nah i don't want to over exaggerate maybe like um 25 to 30 minutes i really wasn't paying too much attention but a full charge right here this is the the full gram that i've been chiefing on it's been about a week already man i really these things really do last all right so i'm gonna go ahead and switch this one out for you guys and give you guys a taste test of the gorilla glue number four all right so go ahead and put that right there but before anything my mouth is kind of dry i'm not gonna lie um i'm gonna go ahead and take a sip of this gatorade man make sure you guys are always staying hydrated okay don't be smoking until you're like literally dying of thirst but that's really really bad so before anything before i take this first hit guys i want to mention the battery i have the limited edition battery and this one right here is the normal starter kit battery it's a black version so i might be doing a giveaway for this one just go check out my instagram i might pop something up on there and then you know that way you guys can get potentially get a free one but for now the new normal gorilla glue number four full gram we're gonna be giving you guys a first you know first-hand impression of what cebi g thinks about it what do i think of the consistency of the 90 thc is it fire is it black you know what do i think of it overall man enough talking though let's go ahead and just hit it um cheers guys took a blinker right there [Music] oh honestly i didn't even expect it to hit me that hard but like once i exhaled that i had to literally stop for a second and just be like holy smokes dude because did you guys see that huge cloud that came out of my mouth that was i don't think it was a normal 10 second blinker i could be wrong but i think i counted seven seconds but either way the cloud is super fat that means that the proprietary battery they have it adjusted perfectly so that way you know with their pods themselves you get the perfect hit every single time you don't over burn it because i didn't taste over burned at all usually with blinkers you kind of get an essence of like you know all right you should have probably stopped it like at seven seconds but with that hit right there it was actually super smooth i got kind of like a lemony taste off of the first hit obviously i have to wake up the coil i'm actually not really too sure all right yeah there's definitely two wicks down there on the bottom you guys obviously i'm going to try to show you because you're not going to be able to see it but there's two on the bottom right there that hit oh my goodness dude that hit literally just smacked me but it was enjoyable it was actually really freaking smooth i liked how smooth it was all the way from the inhale to the exhale that blinker really didn't seem like it was hard at all to do and i think i'm ready for another hit alright guys so like i was saying um legal legality man this thing is actually um crazy to me how we're it's changing so much and this company is actually being really really consistent with their percentages as like like i was saying i've had a lot of people tell me like yo this company is super super consistent they taste fire they don't taste fake at all they don't taste like like bs they use really really high quality product in their um you know in their finishing pods and it's just overall fire so that's what really led to me i was like when i saw it i was like yo that the packaging looks dope overall i think it's just like something that was very very eye appealing and i just had to go ahead and take the leap but the gorilla glue number four it just hits on a different level man i'm just gonna go ahead and give it another hit because i want to taste more of it all right so let's go in on hit number two i should have probably turned off the air but honestly who cares it's way too hot in here for sorry about that guys but look at these clouds oh my goodness the smoothness though i'm talking about i haven't tasted i haven't like felt a smoothness in a in a pod this in in like a long time dude in a very very long time i feel like whenever i chi chiefs dizzies or i chief you know 510 thread cartridges or plug plays i i always feel like a really really harsh irritation in my chest you know that's kind of why i really stopped smoking those was because it made me feel really bad but so far i'm gonna i'm giving you guys my completely 100 honest sabby g um you know like i don't really want to say this a review but you know because this is just a normal video of me trying this out and then you guys you pretty much see the first hand impression if i like it or not so you guys are seeing like i'm not coughing i'm not dying like i used to um this is overall really really clean i feel like i can taste the the purity in the oil itself it's not like harsh and i can take blinker after blinker and just get smacked but the high that get that it gives you is like a super super super clean high it's not like a super groggy high that i usually get from pods themselves it's a very very uplifting and mellow high and it just creeps up on you it obviously the more you hit it the more it's going to get you faded and um but with 90 percent tc you got to be careful man you definitely got to be careful because uh 90 is a lot so imagine taking you know blinker after blinker of a 90 that you're gonna get you're gonna get pretty faded man so definitely i think this would be dope to do a challenge like one like one of these pods in one sitting so what do you guys say maybe if we can do like 500 likes on this video over 500 likes maybe new normal would be down to hook up a you know a video so we could do one pod in one sitting and we'll actually do it though this time i don't care how long it takes we're gonna go out to the woods we're gonna go out to the beach we're gonna go out somewhere walk around and win a finish one all right i don't care how long it takes 90 thc pod i know i know you guys want to see that happen so go ahead over 500 likes and i'll definitely go ahead and do it but i'm gonna go ahead and switch this pot out and i'm gonna be getting over the granddaddy pert because the gorilla glue number four so far i'm like i don't i know you guys could see it in my eyes i'm actually starting to get pretty faded and um it's like very soothing honestly it's like after a long day of you being out and about and doing things you just want to come home and just like feel this comfort so granddaddy perp slapping it back on to the battery itself it's going to go ahead and blink let me go ahead and show you guys one more time hopefully that's focused in it's going to go ahead and blink all right so girl of glue number four this is going to be a personal man i might have to save this for whenever i want to just get a big high and just you know say this for a personal for a rainy day but for now granddaddy purple it's like the oil is the same color there's really no no difference that's how you know the consistency is there um this one oh using it this one at night puts me to sleep every single time so right now i'm probably going to go ahead and have to take a nap after this let's go ahead and take this granddaddy purp cheers it was a blinker super smooth on the throw honestly like super smooth and it has like with the flavors it's not a very overpowering like taste it's not at all it's not like like i know with some pods and some cartridges you get like this super fake like additive in it and whenever you vape it just like it leaves a film in your mouth at least for me and i don't like it i don't like the taste of that at all i hate it but this this is just completely different guys this is just completely different way for me it's clean it's smooth it makes me feel like like wow i could actually be hitting this all the time you feel me so the more that i hit this honestly i'm just like yo i keep getting more and more faded i'm like i wish i had someone here enjoying this with me honestly so what we're gonna be doing i'm gonna go ahead and just give one away man so go ahead and go follow my instagram it's sebby2ys.g and i'm going to be doing a giveaway on

expected by the next day that post to be up so just go ahead and follow my account just to um have a heads up all right just to know when that post um when this giveaway is going to be done i'm too

mix", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you",

unless I say 225th Oh the fifth to five 2020 so yeah I mean guys like I'm hoping this is going to be a fresh card she seems super excited about it and on top of it I don't even know what this is but like there's something right here take this off there's something right here that like gives like I guess like information but to find out pull it out I mean like rip it I guess you're supposed to yeah you're supposed to okay yeah you're supposed to take it off because it opened up just like this criminal warning storage information manufacture information see if the information note that is it kind of ripped off so I can't read that substance abuse warning and adverse event reporting adverse event potential product facts warnings keep that product away from probably children oh okay so it's basically the normal the normal their normal safety warnings and stuff I guess that's pretty cool how they do that I know you guys like it right back on there you know I so it says up here depressed or something flat right insert a flat object and push to open example a key or a pin or better yet I had a [ __ ] dab soul alright of course there's a sticker down here so you're gonna crack that sumbitch yeah that sumbitch open I'm super sorry about this man let's go already I like it I like to I like the packaging I like the hardware I mean not really hard let me look at this thing here SEC I like yeah I like this packaging ok even has a soft [ __ ] on the back here just out on the back no banging around not much uh not much head space here at all ladies and gentlemen and that's pretty good this is a fifty dollar cartridge of course it says C sell on it alright it looks like the normal the normal kind of I know if I have one just laying around I normally do anyway it looks like the normal sea so cartridges yeah I don't have one just laying around here I wish I did but I don't but yes it looks like the normal sea so Clark just not much headspace to charge up time here we go oh I bet that headspace here like I said not much headspace yet oh all right let's see here with this flavor it tastes like it says supposed to be what citrusy peppery mmm definitely peppery got a little thing on my tone there alright this guy had hook this [ __ ] thing up to the battery full spectrum spectrum our full spectrum full-spectrum let's see Jerry's hmm man I think what that's one thing I will say about the distillates that I do kind of miss the taste of the distillates because this was Joe I got some tasty as cartridges like I mean from from fruity to like cake to like straight-up tur P to straight-up cushy to skunky like it's crazy like I could take a cart there's a pink lemonade and make it taste like pink lemonade it's amazing now this one here is kind of earthy definitely a definitely peppery earthy I'm Dino the pool you know what Connor it kind of reminds me of like ups of a light MK ULTRA kind of flavor which was really really good yeah yeah like like it m'kay what's your kind of this what is reminding me I like my own notebook my wife got it for me it's I keep my little do my homework on the on the you know on the medicine I get but this is actually not not too too bad so just just say this the taste is is good I like to taste the price for $50 for a distillate a full spectrum I mean I don't really know the difference between full spectrum I guess I shouldn't looked thankful spectrum just means like one plant like nothing ounces on there but it's nice that they did it if they didn't have any literate live courts are carts I would I would definitely buy another one of these the 1937 [ __ ] full spectrum cars I mean this isn't bad or I would go with like the what is it there's another one out there that's so-called full spectrum I think it's I think it might be MPX or curio or some [ __ ] like that that has them like this but this taste I really can't get over to taste this taste is pretty amazing you bit what and I have it on the low the lowest setting on my battery tip - I don't never turn it up high I'm not trying to burn no oil in it but I'm definitely filling it definitely found it I haven't smoked in a few hours I wanted to wait to see how good this was and to be honest with you for a full spectrum distillate cart I got a nice little buzz going on and it's not like a little buzz either it's a nice I got a nice little buzz going on ahead buzz I got a nice little sweat going on almost like a dabs but I'd say mmm I don't feel like energized but I don't feel couch locked so that's that that's dead hybrid right there you know yeah man this is this is good for fourth distillate not bad not bad at all mmm if you're not let me tell you those guys if you're not a heavy dabber desolates will work for you all day every day right but like if you dab a heavy then you want to go with the liquid live resin karts that's just the way to go if you're if you're a heavy diver but if not if you're just a fire smoker bring these [ __ ] with you know these things a fire I mean it's part either way for the FIR for what this one is I'm really enjoying this one Thank You Colleen thank you thank you thank you Nicole thank

let's go 2020 this Hempfest is near my operations coming up so wish me luck on my operation yeah nothing else to say I'm just I'm just Malin area guys turbo Tom is out love young peace", "W5c2hQqr8No": "yo what is going on youtube welcome back to another banger by your boy sebi g guys so man as you guys can see by the time i'm not even gonna sit here and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600 likes all right i know we could hit over 600 likes easily you guys do it all the time man when i don't ask you guys to smash that like button you guys are over here hitting 400 500 likes so i know this one time that your boy asked you for a like we could run it up to over 600 right boys and once we get that i'm gonna go ahead and go out and cop my favorite cartridges of 2020 put you guys on game all right boys so with that being said let's go ahead and

we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking some millenium extracts blueberry which is a 70 percent THC and we are going to be putting it into this cartridge which as you can see right here is an eye crusher JC 1:05 standard 510 thread cartridge all right well let's heat this up and get it on okay prepare the oil you're going to fill the cartridge with take your cartridge remove the mouthpiece now you're going to want to take your applicator and put it as far into as possible then slowly begin to dispense your oil into the cartridge [Music] if you have a very thick oil you'll see that it takes a while to move farther down into the cartridge that's just something that takes a while to do make sure you get as much of it as far down as possible we're going up filling up the rest of the cartridge once it is full leaving a little bit of space [Music] take your cartridge would you know filled with oil put the mouthpiece back on it's over screw it closed now we're going to take this cartridge and let it warm up a little bit and that all those bubbles float on out of there so here it is all ready to go this is the eye crusher JC 105 as you can see right there I crusher it's a very popular 510 thread Partridge we are going to be trying this out on our ego - very nice battery we've had for a while all right let's try this thing out for function [Music] all right well there you have it nice smooth flavor on it seem to work good got some nice function on it all right well these can be found at vape parts Mart calm you make sure you swing over there and have a look at them if you're looking for some cartridges to refill they've got a very nice widest orbit well thanks for tuning in uisidenav salute wonderful day peace", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "2TfecBnTUZ8": "all right so we're gonna go over fake West Coast cure now the easiest way to tell if it's fake if it's not a pod it's fake now here's the distill it pod here's a live resin pod libraries and sauces on the bottom and it's gonna use this cure pod battery okay kind of looks similar to a Stasia pod and here's what the fakes look like so here's from our website and we'll have a link to that below all these cartridges all the cartridges are fake if you look on weed maps there's no cartridges for w-c-c it's all pods okay and here on DHgate they're selling the cartridge so basically as long as it's a pod you're good if it's a cartridge it's fake now here's some identifier things to look for on the pods because inevitably fake pods are gonna come out now the battery being faked there might not be much to get around that and the fake bad reason might just end up working too but when it comes to the pods you definitely don't want to be doing fake oil and my head THC in it but we don't know the quality the hardware that's being used even if the oil is good and that's one of the things about fake cartridges or you know that the counterfeit of brands that is important to know and here we'll look on some things on here so this is probably a store sticker right here you're gonna see this button on the side so this is like a you have to hold that button down in order to open the pod open the box that has the pot in it you're gonna see test results on the back and it's gonna have all those numbers on there and it's possible in certain areas maybe in Northern California they might have maybe a different sticker on the future I've seen that with select elite that's been real but these look pretty uniform for now so there may be some changing in the testing sticker but this is we're in July of 2020 and this is what it looks like and if you go to another area it's possible make sure make sure you had a registered store when you're buying them but it's possible testing stickers might look different in some areas and I've just seen that with the other carts so there's your logo that's what it looks like yeah so just to avoid the cartridges it's really that simple if you avoid all the WCC cartridges you're avoiding all the fakes because they don't make cartridges they just make pods and we'll also have a review coming up in these pods and down below we'll have a link to our guide on the fake WCC items but it's all really simple and that's it thanks for watching and y'all have a great week", "LUDYeJtJidU": "what's up everybody welcome back or welcome today we are going to see how to take apart a sealed cartridge now normally as countries they're either sealed or the screwed on and the round ones like these are usually sealed supposed to be sealed compressed into there and the they have other ones that have the fluted or the flat tip that are also compressed in there but this cart is still reusable so if you can get it open you can fill it back up we use it quite a few times before you have to get rid of it so you can't untwist it this is that doesn't have a school screw on her screw thread on there when you take it apart I'm gonna show you right now you don't want to try to turn it what you want to do is try and twist it and pull it twist it and pull it but you want to be careful you don't damage it because you don't want to grab it with the pliers and mess up the anything around it to make it sharp or this form so you've got to grab a towel then with pliers you grab this end make sure you got enough of a towel there okay okay and then you're gonna wiggle slowly wiggle slowly wiggle take your time just keep wiggling and bam you got yourself a open card now you can refill it reuse it you wanna be take your time be gentle cuz you can break this whole part often it's no good okay but if you keep wiggling you will get it out I've tried twisting it before and I've never had success that way but if you wiggle wiggle wiggle it'll come out mmm it smells like piney but oh you're on the mouthpiece there and they're still all your in there so this is still reusable there's no reason to toss it out if you can still fill it back up point I just refill it when you want to and to put it back together you're just gonna have to obviously put it back where it was in the slot there and push it down hard and you will be able to seal it back up there once it's filled up you fill it up like a normal cartridge screw on cartridge and then you can go ahead and compress it and it will go back into place okay it's a little bit far out there very little so once it's in place and you're not gonna spill your oil you can flip it probably down push it okay so I've had this problem before too so it's not sealing right now so what we're gonna have to do it's clean around the edges because it has oil so the oil is not letting it sit back down it's acting as like a grease so you want to clean around here okay and clean around here and then press it back together so that's what I'm gonna do right now I'll come back and you'll see it'll go back together okay so I've cleaned up both sides around here and around the inside of here okay you want to be careful when you're filling it up you don't want to get nothing in this area here because it won't let it sit back down so when you fill it up you want to use a syringe or clean it up after you fill it up - down here now that we got both parts cleaned you can go ahead and push it down you can leave it like that since you don't want anything to spill and push it down hard okay you see it even grab the towel there and then when uh you got it sealed a bit you can turn it back around see the back tight and there you go back to normal sealed and will not come out you don't want to do like I did don't even fix a towel there you see that so I'll take that off later but this is just to show you you can pull it out if that happens to you pull it out a little bit and pull it push it back in you can see it's right back in its place and it's not coming out okay usually when you twist these do not come out when they twist you can twist all day long and you're not gonna get them out okay you can only do it the way I explained there and that's how to use your shield cart a lot of dispensaries have this style as well as the threaded style so if you get this style running you use it there you go", "aiWVkxPev7A": "[Music] all right

about this cartridge it's that when like you do get high it's like a really clean hi I like that and as you can see the oil it's a really good quality oil um what I don't like about this cartridge though is that if I put it too tight on my battery like if I put it all the way so it doesn't move or anything it just doesn't work on my battery as you can see I press it and he just blink I'm gonna take one hit and then I'm gonna go buy food I think I'm gonna get a tropical smoothie [Music] and what I'm just gonna go all right that was like a two minute drive I'm here yeah alright so I just got

allowing gravity to do its job and get all the oil out of the cartridges without having residual oil left over from cartridges with the intake oil holes and the side of the rods as you can see we also did carry some premium plastic cartridges with the wicks and gold silver also with black tips and here's another one of our newer popular products the pods these are ceramic coils they are not wicks

got milk rod art and vs. bar garden video once again you guys really enjoyed the first one and you guys know me man I'm [ __ ] I love raw garden man rock garden is like my top right now this brand rock garden is amazing but today I feel like we already reviewed this one the key lime honestly I to be honest with you guys to be honest with you guys I don't remember but this one thing oh [ __ ] gasps berries and cream and I'm kind of just sick try this one Oakland but you guys know man got the v-model got this the Ease battery out it's been a minute was good with the blinker you never had a blinker and this part has to be like my favorite shirt honestly but we got the key lime pie ladies and gentleman was good you know let's check it out ooh okay okay this one's looking nice and clear I want to compare some of the flavors because a lot of people say that this [ __ ] all just has the same taste and I'm like you know that I don't disagree with you but at the same time like there has to be like a little hint of flavor the gasps berries and cream I think this one's gonna be gasps so everybody always asked me how come I never hit blinkers and well you know what I got iron baby lungs and the reason why I keep myself the reason why I take such little hits and I don't hit blinkers and uh that's just because once I start hitting blinkers I've said it before my tolerance is gonna go up and then I'm out to start taking blinkers like all the time just to get kind of let you know and then just it's just not and that way you know every time I take little hits I'm always lit and I don't have to take off I hate to get lit you know I think this one is the guy's very soul oh [ __ ] okay I gotta restart that actually I'm ready to go oh this one oh this is a podcast I do not condone the usage of these products this is literally just an educational review you know just kick them back but all right I got you guys for shading this time shout out to the whole world shout out to everybody watching this video that what you guys wanted whoa I was only off by like two three seconds but I felt like that shows gonna blink and oh that one hurt gasps berries and cream at 81 percent THC the key line the key line is at a key lime is that 89 percent THC damn this was pretty much 90% maybe this is the one that I hit right now sheesh god damn yo I swear it let me know the comments down below if you guys are able to hit a legit raw garden blinker bro [ __ ] bro that [ __ ] is tough let's try the beam on Wow I can only imagine if I hit it on the B want dude I even hit that [ __ ] out of loli sensitivity - I got so Pete decide everybody the reason why alright so I don't really be smoking out crazy like how people think you know people think like I'm probably I'm probably stoned all day but now I'll probably only get lit you know when I'm recording a video or maybe like a nighttime you know when I'm doing my [ __ ] but I always had this like theory in my head where if I don't hit anything too hard or if I try not to get my turn it's like super super high up I'm gonna remain a lightweight when it comes to smoking but at the same time it's just like how do I see it like the amount of either like wax or like trees that I have to smoke to get lit is so little compared to like all my friends like I thought all my friends these guys are like everyone has like a really high tolerance and I feel like my tolerance is low just because you know I kind of take like controlled hits if that makes sense you know I'll tell I'll take enough for me to feel late if that makes sense I mean I'm still getting late I'm still taking [ __ ] hits you know but I don't be taking like big ass hits because that way you know my thoughts is just low and I'm getting late cuz I'll stop [ __ ] it bro oh my god I'm [ __ ] zooted right now whoo yeah yeah and I got you guys a in the next video get into the cartridge I'm gonna try another blinker you know until we finally got it for the video but hey you know I'm just trying to keep it real with you guys you know like [ __ ] that regarding who you know it's pretty little - I just recently just saw the 710 pods like I think that's literally gonna be like the next video I make right there just the 7/10 pause Allen ooh I didn't see it like til I was walking out the door like you know I was just walking I was just looking at the club I was just looking at the selection I was like on my way out what the [ __ ] I saw like you know the 7 10 11 spot it was like 75 bucks and I was like you know what this [ __ ] must be so far you know you know so especially with cartridges there anything else like I just be taking like the littlest baby hits I get it lit but it's just like my tolerance is just stays low you know so that's I wanted sometimes like like right now [ __ ] died right now holy [ __ ] let's shot both [ __ ] oh [ __ ] late I know you get that thumbnail going you know me yeah so stay tuned everybody for a seven-ten labs review cuz I'm for sure gonna cop to of those I don't first you're gonna do to 710 labs and one sitting [ __ ] am definitely gonna review those I'm gonna review a couple more studies to that keyline is just fired I think this is the key line hmm just like [ __ ] which is which vitas Aquila is the gas right here the gas berries and cream oh [ __ ] I heard both these flavors were like really popular but I can see why like gas berries and cream sad catchy name but the key line is just pretty much 90% THC almost all of them have like the same flavor would like a little extra policy look this one does look a little bit more yellowish than this one but they're both cleared I think I'm just tripping I'm [ __ ] tripping they're both the same color so this company and viral cleanse um hit me up right so they have like little like like mini AC filter machines where you can just put like you know connect it like for example you can put it in your living room you know your bathroom or like your bedroom for example for me I'm gonna put in my bedroom and you just connect it and you just like powered it up you power it up and it kind of just filters like everything you know it's either smaller if it's like an at your room just kind of smells like a nasty room that doesn't get opened you know like the what you guys don't open the windows I'm not saying you guys though but I'm saying you know there's people out there that don't open windows keep the doors closed and you know eventually the smell I starts to get kind of nasty so this machine right here right it's like a foot it's an air it's an air filter so once you turn it on it's like it starts it's suck it starts to suck I like especially if you're burning too if you're smoking you could literally like [ __ ] have

telling me to try that one out you guys are telling me a lot of cards you know it's a child but the thing is like right now I feel like there's a lot of like I feel like where I live there's like a limited amount of brands you know there's only like there's ease 7-10 those pause now they have select raw garden Moxie I think yeah Moxie and then I think there's like another one other than that I

video make sure you guys drop a like the comment subscribe down I am [ __ ] on another planet right now [ __ ] these were too good ass flavors goddamn alright so I figured it out alright so this is the gas berries and cream cuz it should taste like cream legit damn this one actually has a really smooth taste yeah this one's good the [ __ ] the gas berries and cream and then the key line was just [ __ ] just strong it sounds like a low-lying taste and it just packs a punch because it's pretty much 90% THC so that's my final verdict but hey everybody gasp a reason for you damn that's [ __ ] delicious", "X6LwrJqHDQQ": "[Music] you also sister G Pharma TV here coming at you with another tutorial and today I'm going to give you a quick rundown on how to use the new and improved liquid gold vape pen comes packaged with just the mod and actually a key charger and you go ahead and charge your pen it will turn on red and when it's fully charged it will turn on green indicating that it's fully charged this 510 threading pen is compatible with both drug run and pure tanks 510 thread and cartridges and the first thing you want to go ahead and do after you put your cartridge on is simply turn on the panel by pressing the flash button five times five then you want to go ahead and activate the pre heating element by pressing the flash button two times we'll go ahead and see a mixture of all the colors and if you want to go ahead and stop it from the pre heating element I soon as you see the smoke you press that button once and you stop the creating mistake I do not recommend you to vape this cartridge while it is in increasing state after you're done preheating your oil it's ready to vape the first setting that it will go ahead and start off is when it's green setting which is the lowest voltage of the three three point six volt if you press the splash button three times it will then move the voltage from green to blue from the lowest setting to the highest setting at 4.00 voltage the draw difference between the green setting in the blue lady makes night and day I definitely got a bigger risk and it was a definitely a little bit more calm after the blue setting by simply pressing the splash button three it will drop down to the middle to the neutral blinking red you now know you're vaping it at its middle setting at 3.8 voltage now whatever setting you prefer adjust it try out the waters see what works best up for you when you're done and you have the voltage that fits your need just simply hold down the splash but in this pen and battery is designed to go ahead and turn off after eight seconds of date and automatically so we do this for your safety we understand you have lungs of Steel you get wine eight seconds of 18 per hit you can simply go ahead and let go before the eighth second and continue with your desire to have a bigger hit that's the small tip the new liquid gold vape in coming in assorted colors 510 threading and packaged with its own USB charger a new warmup feature when you click the splash button twice and you can go ahead and activate three voltage settings all color-coordinated by clicking a splash button three times and of course turn on your pin and turn it off with a simple 5 splash click go ahead and make sure you check out the closest retailer near you on G farmer navcom and if you're already making make the switch to a liquid gold vape in and save yourself some time I know what voltage you're vaping your oil and being controlled with the liquid gold vape in don't forget to go ahead and like this video

another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review

"LX6LJ2fXyJU": "hey there happy Tuesday so today I'm gonna do another product review and this one I'm so excited about this is a vape that I bought recently at our dispensary it's called a Cresco vape and the strain is by oh Jesus and so by oh Jesus I was immediately drawn to it because of the name obviously it's just a very funny mental picture that it brings up for me so I bought it also it sounded very eastery so I was like well let's go with that this is an indica strain which means it's a little more relaxing on the relaxing side of things which is what I'm always looking for so the first thing I noticed is that it says it's a liquid live resin pen and I was like huh liquid live resin pen I've never seen those words together like that if that sounds like gibberish to you I can tell you a little bit about it liquid live resin pen it essentially means that it's from a fresh plant so I used to work in a little backstory I used to work as a harvester at a cannabis cultivation Center harvester tremor that kind of thing and I do know about live resin because of that so live resin is essentially a fresh plant so you go in the room you cut the plant down it's fresh you flash-freeze it you throw it immediately in a freezer and it preserves all those nutrients all those flavors everything is just fresh and frozen right away so it's kind of like if you harvested a bunch of vegetables like peas or carrots and then immediately flash froze them they're gonna be very fresh tasting and it's the same way with cannabis so this is from a fresh plant that's been frozen quickly and then made into a vape pen so I know that could sound like a lot of garbled e [ __ ] but basically what that means is that it's a very fresh taste taste very much like a fresh plant when it grows that's the difference so instead of it being cured and you know taking you know weeks to dry out it's just fresh and flash frozen so that's quick backstory but let me first just show you the vape pen itself so this is the vape here it's Cresco is the brand red is there a little branding for indica meaning relaxing and it has a tip here that lights up so when you stuck on at the end lights up and there's no buttons to it so if you're somebody that's new to the vape scene this is great it's a disposable pen and it's great because it's preloaded with cannabis oil and when you're done with it the end will just blink like hey this is done it'll just blink and you won't get any vapor out and you just throw this away or recycle it I'm trying to recycle things more so I like it because there's nothing to think about you don't have to load it there's no buttons there's no temperature it's extremely simple so all you do is literally open up your little childproof packaging up top take it out and then fake so that's what I love about these they're so discreet I keep one of these with me literally 100% of the time in the event that I start to feel like a panicky or have a panic attack luckily I don't really have that trouble like I used to but that's how I got out of it is I carried one of these with me at all times so I kind of think of these like an inhaler I know that's kind of a weird way to think of a vape but for me it's almost like an inhaler because I just take two quick seconds two breaths really quick and I exhale I feel way different so if you're looking for something that's like quick relief a vape is awesome it's pretty strong let me see here this one is doo-doo-doo 87% THC so that's pretty strong to give you an idea when you grow weed like just regular weed that you smoke and you see in movies usually that's about 30% THC is a good strain like a pretty pretty high strain 20 to 30% this one's 87 so you don't need much of it like a little hit I took earlier is all someone should start off with if you're new to this but I like it because it does save me a lot of money this was let's see 35 dollars and it'll last me at least a couple weeks maybe three weeks if I'm you know not using it too much but for me I like it because it just kicks in right off the bat and have to think about it it also doesn't really smell like there's a little bit of a weed smell but it's not like permeating my hair and my clothes and everything it's just a very discreet kind of thing so if you're you know looking for something that's easy to use not smelly go with one of these vapes for me this is seriously one of the tastiest wants trains I've ever had the bio Jesus train so if you have access to it highly recommend it great Easter strain I feel like you can't go wrong for me the effects are just very relaxing I feel a little more calm like I can just chill I feel a little more grounded those are some things that I attribute to this babe all right well that's my product review hope you're having a good day take care", "Z35Wku6cpY8": "sup guys so I got a buddy's live resident this is a sativa pineapple kimochi Correction hybrid my bad it got some of the information on the back some of the terpene profiles used to get the strain to taste the way it does there's zero CBD which sucks but I mean kind of excited cuz still some this is still live resin so just try to shut out it's a bit darker than the last two you I had from buddies so just try it out and the the shed in the backyard another taste you could definitely take some pineapple kind of tastes like the pineapple version of cz also got the battery which is just a easy draw you don't have to press any anybody or anything so pretty pretty dope now the clear tips nice - yeah so overall overall a great package say it again so let's think rapes when is a Cecil cartridge puts in work so hope you guys are smoking tool especially on while this quarantine is in place and this rain makes it even better so yeah once again every pull you you have on this it's pretty smooth I haven't really tried see sell that much I had a palm palm battery that kind of broke like two months into it so that was a fail and so far I have no complaints on see so it burns very evenly it's a small to draw so we got day four of the pineapple kimochi hybrid it still hasn't lost his taste the pool is still pretty small it's not getting stuck yet on the mouthpiece so this buddy's pen battery / cartridge has been pretty great for a hybrid now when I saw the TV 65% I was kind of like I'm not gonna feel it or for whatever reason but I was wrong it's very very strong and the battery lasts forever so tonight obtained recommend Cheers", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration breaks video and you'll be chillin just fine so god I feel like I have to Kaufman try get it out there we go ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to start just off the taste potency I'm feeling it for sure I'm feeling like really loose just chill just you know a good vibe just feeling myself I send it real weird I don't know I just feel like some popping out some good music after this hydration break just chillin y'all having a real x19 place me game that I

super easy and convenient on the go big shout out to hamilton devices when i do think of a score out of 10 okay we got a charger down here as well um when i think of a score out of 10 you know i'm gonna be honest uh the price point on this is usually between 75 and 100 but throughout the pandemic we've seen it drop down to 50. and so because of the price point the quality the ease of use um the long duration of the charge i'm going to give this product a 9.5 where i where i take away from this item is i want more people to know about it i haven't even really known about it there hasn't been much marketing there isn't much education out there and so you know there is a warranty so i got to give them that super cool um but i'm sitting at a 9.5 a device as good as this needs to be out there more they got to do more content you got to do more education i need to see some cool people using it other than that this is a perfect experience and so if you guys have any questions be sure to drop

mean I figured nature would be the best place to do this review video so for this video I have here this is a gram cartridge by buddies this is one gram distillate with no added flavor alright this has got no added flavor so this is the buddies and again no added flavor alright I got to make sure that I make that very clear for everybody so this is coming in at 87 percent THC this is royal dog-walker alright it is the Royal dog walker it's not just regular dog Walker its royal [ __ ] okay you better bow down and recognize alright anyway it is a beautiful product first off let's see if we get a good view on that look at that that is a beautiful beautiful nice product right there that's a nice distillate so this this cartridge cost me twenty nine dollars for medical here in Oregon and for recreational that means anybody over the age of 21 with valid ID you could pick this cartridge up this buddy's cartridge with no added flavor for about thirty nine dollars recreational so that's not bad either anyway I got my om extracts battery here that I'm using really cool battery just because it's got the the charger right there at the bottom you can just charge it use a regular phone charger whatever kind of you know LG charger and we're going through this nice little I want you guys to see this really quick for my stuff there's a nice little area it's nice little walk path this looks like where somebody would get murdered in a scary movie like hey let's go through the forest yeah oh man but it's nice it's nice out today and so like I said before I figure we do this review video outside so um right here's a good area there ain't nobody around so let's uh go ahead and try this bad boy [Music] [Music] not bad man that is really smooth and that tastes really good it doesn't taste too much like dog walker though if you've ever actually had dog walker it's got that diesel that really gassy diesel taste it mainly because of the chem dog in it but man not bad it's got like a fruity sweet taste to it with a little tinge of that gas eNOS at the end that's how I describe it not super fruity more sweet but like that you know sweet fruity ish with a little gassy Diesel at the end that's how I'd describe the terpenes on this and I don't know does it say make cannabis deprived terpenes you see that peep it because it's very important when you get these cartridges all right very [ __ ] important I can't tell you enough please guys please please please please please try to stay away from the flavored stuff now I know that I've done a few review videos on some of the flavored stuff but that doesn't mean that that's what I personally smoke okay this is the kind of stuff that I personally smoke those review videos are just for reviews okay they're nothing more than that anyway so this buddies I don't know if it says it doesn't say the terpenes on it but it's pretty tasty alright this is a hybrid distillate 1 gram vape cartridge distillate alright I'll make sure I say that again because I want people think and it's BHO or anything else but this is a distillate I love it this is a perfect item for somebody on the go this perfect item very discreet easy to use if you're out somewhere like this you know you know what I mean you're just out enjoying nature maybe you're taking a trip somewhere it doesn't matter these are very easy to use and again they're very very discreet alright a lot of people that don't smoke mistake these for actual vape you know mods and stuff like that they think it's a juice I don't know we come to a fork of the road here I don't know which way to go it's either that way we're that way but hold on let me let me show you guys this this is the other side of the entrance this isn't a nice little walk I don't know if you guys caught any of that walk through there but does a nice little walk so anyway let's go this way all right check it out it's really hot out here it's like 93 degrees or some [ __ ] and it's only getting hotter summer has just begun out here at Eastern Oregon a lot of people think that I'm in the Portland area or Salem OR Eugene or something like that now I live out here in Eastern Oregon Hermiston Oregon good old harvestin out here in the damn desert as you can see mostly everything out here is dead just burning up out here in the desert man it's kind of shitty to grow out here because if you don't do your if you don't amend your soil right if you don't make sure that you know everything's on you know the up and up and legit you'll end up with that like desert hay tasting weed man and that sucks Oh God does it taste like [ __ ] alright so if you're growing out here in the desert man remember to amend your soils correctly man because you don't want that nasty hay taste [Music] so my thoughts on this one gram cart bye buddies I have to say I highly recommend it it's something that's still somewhat affordable it's not going to break the bank but it's exactly what you want when you're looking for carts okay the cart gives you a big massive hit which is always you know what I'm looking for because I want to feel like I'm taking a DAB you know what I mean I don't want to feel like Joe I'm just taking like these little nothing cloud hits I want to feel it I don't know there's a lot of you guys out there that are the same way but I would say this is it like I said exactly what you're looking for when you're going shopping for a cart you're looking for a cart that functions well it's not you know a cheap cart these carts are actually really nice carts you're looking for the product itself to be really good okay you're looking for those higher numbers especially for distillate you want those high eighty 90s and I mean that's just beautiful distillate look at that that's just beautiful distillate you know what I mean there's nothing I could say about that you could see yourself just some really nice you know very see-through golden distillate which is very beautiful all right no arguing that and again eighty eighty seven eighty seven percent THC almost ninety that is some good numbers those are some good test results right this doesn't have any CBD in it or at least it doesn't tell me but oh wait it does it does have a house three point five fifty three percent of CBD in it so that is a little bit of a bonus in there so nice I didn't read the side I'm a dumbass but anyway seriously no I like that though so the breakdown tea 85% is a total cannabinoid okay so that's the overall total the actual breakdown of it is 75 percent while 75 point 69 percent THC if we want to get technical about it then again three point 53 percent CBD so that's the breakdown of it nice nice nice nice not bad it's hoping that the THC would be a little bit higher than 75 to be honest especially when you're dealing with distillate a lot of distillates are in those higher numbers you know what I mean but hey as long as it tastes great as long as I'm getting a good hit as long as you know my cart is functioning because there's a lot of carts that [ __ ] up there's a lot of carts that you'll end up sucking the oil through or they'll just burn out and quit to stop working and you're [ __ ] with half of your grammar if not more in there yeah so you go you you got to add that in when you're shopping for these babies so big shout out to buddies again the Royal dog walker which if you ever get a chance to try dog walker itself it's one of my favorite strains a highly recommended man that that Terr pee gas diesel skunky oh.just musters the nostrils and I love it I love it I love it I love it look at these boulders they're very big boulders so I don't drive my car into that Lake I guess if I'm like crazy on crack or some [ __ ] oh there's deer over here I think I scared the deer by yelling too loud I just saw him take a you know beeline it straight for the woods over here that's some crazy [ __ ] he's like oh no not these [ __ ] again look at this white boy out here talking and getting high I can't take this [ __ ] anyway I want to go down here that's nice if there wasn't like fish hooks and all kinds of poke and [ __ ] from people fishing in here I'd probably be like let's go swimming in here in fact then again I don't know they they these are the pawns that they stock every so often so nothing but just small trout oh nothing big for all you stoner fishermen out there if you are a stoner fisherman let me know in the comment section below there's a lot of them out there you know getting stoned and going fishing is a really relaxing fun thing to do I'd have to say I'd do it from time to time anyway so I got to get back to a buddy's good kart recommended if you guys are on a budget can't afford those 50 60 $70 cards if you guys you know need something that is trustworthy none of that added flavor [ __ ] known on cannabis deprived terpenes then go buddies man they're your buddy all right they just want to be your buddy all right they fit in your pocket very discreet easy to use 510 thread so they fit almost almost every [ __ ] battery out there and like I said man just they're trying to be your buddy be their buddy follow them on Facebook and Instagram so you could stay updated with all the product they got all right and the different flavors and everything just everything amazing about buddies all right guys if you guys like this video if you guys like nature if you guys found anything I said at all informational or entertaining remember to support this channel by giving a big

of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an underground army of child laborers in

show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "WwCPV68P4a0": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplicity here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another wax video some diamonds today actually and what a coincidence you guys have been mentioning about west coast companies and stuff and i mentioned you know there's like a west coast company coming out every month um this one is west coast skier and this is actually a company i've tried before their cartridge so uh this has been around this guy these guys have been around and uh this was 27 out the door i will be playing a video of it right now but as with diamonds it's running with a high percentage of thc uh total cannabinoid is 95.4 percent um thc 82.5 and the strain is papaya cake and papaya to me is very familiar in tasting with guava so uh that's what i i'm assuming i think i think i've had a papaya before and i'll just like guava so uh but yes i already opened it it looks good smells good 27 out the door and it goes to say with all their stuff west coast gear had their diamonds live resin butter or whatever they were all the same price i believe at authentic and the smell is there you know i'm saying which is surprising because with diamonds there's not really too much smell or taste um so i'm i'm hoping that these taste as good as they smell but it's definitely gonna get me smacked up we got the dip no i'm saying oh i just turned it off but let's just turn that on leave this cap over here and get a big diamond for the people [ __ ] people are always saying like i take small dabs i'm like well it's not a competition i take enough for me to get high you know i'm saying it's not a race it's not a competition you know since when was smoking weed and relaxing a competition you know i'm saying like it's really crazy what like people trip over especially on a video on youtube someone you don't even know you know i'm saying like so what if i'm taking small dabs it's like that's so that's so weird you know the bigger dabs you take the higher tolerance you have you know and in turn just that's a lot of money cheers uh there's no taste i don't think yeah there's no days so i would suggest you get like a very flavorful wax like raw garden or something and then mix a little bit of that sauce with this kind of like what i was doing with the delta eight you know put more of the delta eight and then some of the wax that you've been trying to save and uh it'll basically just take over the wax taste will take over the distillate or in this case the diamonds so uh you can actually get like fat hits and actually make use of shittier lower like not lower quality but like lower potency wax you know mix it with this i can definitely see me using that like that but as far as like taste goes maybe maybe i just got it wrong [Music] so i'm gonna pack that one more time for this video but as far as the taste goes there is none it smells good though or maybe a that's the thing with diamonds guys i don't know if you guys know but like if you're gonna get diamonds try to get like the saucy diamonds you know with like 50 50 sauce and 50 diamonds but cheers guys might i say i am [ __ ] stoned i'll tell you that right now the other video i did of the cali blaze was like an hour ago i'm continuing the ride i wonder if since this doesn't smell or tastes like any air doesn't taste like anything if it smells right all right guys so for its price 27 it's not bad i probably should have purchased um alongside another one of their their cartridge uh they're i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned guys i purchased another one of their wax concentrates like maybe the live resin instead of the diet or not uh purchase the live resin and the diamonds and just mix them when i take hits that would have been dope but yeah as far as like if it gets you high it definitely does but i knew this coming in buying diamonds most likely not going to be like any taste if so minimal um so i i knew what i was going into just kind of sucks that the kelly blaze kind of tastes like all right so if i were to be mixing any wax it'd be those two and it's like damn i could have had another west coast cure or a raw garden you know but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this wax video check out west coast cure if you're looking for some affordable diamonds with no taste but it doesn't matter if it doesn't have no taste you can just mix it with some other stuff but i can see some people saying that you know like what the [ __ ] no taste [ __ ] that [ __ ] but it is cheap diamonds are usually i would say 35 and up so um for at 27 is a eye catcher to say the least you know but other than that hopefully you didn't enjoy this video i would do like i would do i i would like to mention that i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned right now so i haven't started like this in in a while in a video so that definitely means something but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] you", "FVVKvVeIaMw": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman officer honey stick and today we're gonna bring you a real informative video on how to build your perfect dab pen and tank basically your wax pen or dab pen is made of two components the first component is going to be your dad pen battery which we can see lined up here from very simple to complex so you need to have a battery which is essentially your powder plant for your dab unit then you're gonna need to pick out a wax tank which is what you fit the wax into that is actually going to vaporize your wax and what I mean wax or dabs we can talk all the way from you know oils that really hard enough to be to go into solid state all the way to your crumbles your shatters and things like that and you're pressed waxes then as you can see I've also arranged them from simple which is in this term small and then all the way up to big pro size over here which is gonna be more complex now I want today's video not to be too long but just to give you a really good basic idea of when you're trying to put together the perfect wax or DAB vape set that you pick out the perfect dab pen battery and also your wax tank so let's get started if this kind of mix and match is foreign to you at the very end the last two minutes we're gonna run through that we've already paired some and put together some awesome kits for you so if you're unsure you can always pick up already a pre-selected kid that is meant to work for your wax and vape pen needs very very well so let's get started let's start first with the power plant the wax or dab battery so for your wax pen battery or your dad pen you it depends on how big of a tank you want if you want something relatively slim and sleek you can pick up one of these stick batteries right here like this is our elf battery it has three different voltages and you can use any kind of slim wax tank or wax atomizer as a power plant just note that you're gonna want whatever wax atomizer you get should be skinny to match the circumference or the diameter of your battery so if you pick up an extreme tank never mind that this isn't powerful enough to power it you know let's this this would look pretty odd so let's say that for thin batteries you definitely want to pick a slim atomizer so out of our slim batteries we have a whole slew of colors for the elf which is a simplest least expensive buy in here that gives you good power and then you can step up to the twist batteries the twist batteries are one step up which you can twist adjust the voltage this is our phantom carbon fiber twist battery but we also have some twist batteries and other colors in our honey stick line so for the stick batteries you can really step up to two of our slim atomizers which is our phantom wax tank or our silencer both these tanks there's slight differences the phantom wax tank has a dual core power plant the silencer has a slightly larger bowl with a proprietary silica carbide interior both of them do have ceramic bowls but they do use the internal power plants this one's dual ceramic this one's silica carbide I can take it off and show you just so you see here go so here's a little side-by-side let's get real nice and close you can see the inside there here's the silencer just slightly larger bull diameter and then here's the phantom wax ink which is a dual core coil so these are slim these will work real nice with your stick batteries you can pick out the color you want the texture you want whether you want it to be a twist or a variable voltage stay away from Auto draw stick batteries when using your earwax tanks because push buttons generally do give you more consistent power output which is required for the best wax experience so moving right along in our dad pen batteries here if you don't want to stick battery because it might stand out a little bit or it might be kind of tall like this combination you can always go the concealer route and pick up one of honey sticks awesome concealer units which a concealer unit basically means that the unit gets hidden inside of the actual atomizer so let's take our beekeeper 2.0 multi dab pen battery or wax pen battery here and show you what it look like if we paired it with our silencer all of a sudden it is concealed in a small and compact you have more capacity you gonna need some less charges when you go with these bigger batteries and it's gonna keep your wax atomizer hidden it's gonna look really really cool this is also about the same size as a phantom tank this isn't a phantom tank but they're about the same size that's about how it would look there with if you've got the Phantom tank you can do that or you can upgrade to our if you want more features like digital functionality and concealment you can get our bee box Pro which is fully digitally adjustable screen here as you can see to really let you hone on power and this is one of our little flip units so now all of a sudden you a concealer that is all like a key fob real high quality flip and is an awesome little dab pen unit now so you can go with one of the concealers they're digital we also have our our arrow B battery which allows you full temperature control on your wax unit you see it's paired here with the silenced or it fits and real nice if you want something that's luxurious and has a real luxury feel with a few temperatures but it's still simple if one of the digital units is a little too complex I mean if you pair it with our Phantom's signature I mean look at this pairing this is just gorgeous right here this is a luxurious wax pen you get about thousand milliamp hours I mean you're this thing you're gonna be able have about two charges worth of a stick battery two to three charges a stick battery to one charge on this thing that's how much capacity it has it's got the carbon fiber feel and handle this right here is an awesome pairing for the concealer luxury route so that pretty much covers the slim the slim lacks tanks here that we discussed now when you step up to larger wax tanks you're gonna also need a larger dab pen battery which lets get into this section here so what honey stick has is we really have three offerings we have our stinger battery we have our defender battery and we have our sport battery the sport battery and the defender battery are both digitally adjustable and very high output the sport battery has a little bit more sophistication with different temperature wattage and voltage controls and it also goes all the way up to 50 watts of power our defender carbon fiber battery is what powers up our Cannabis Cup kit it runs up to 36 watts you can adjust the voltage or the wattage and what's cool about is you have a little ego adapter so you can actually run slim tanks off of it just as well so if you flip this over you can still put on a slim tank or a 510 prefilled cartridge just make sure that you have your wattage or voltage turn way down because this battery does have a lot of power with our defender option you have several really cool designs that you can choose from to make this battery customizable those are our digital options or very high power but if you're getting a slim tank you might not necessarily need all that power and they're also a little heavier and a little larger as you can see for example compared to our phantoms and concealers you know they do carry a little bit more heft but they put out a lot more power so if you don't want digital adjustability but you want some high power our stinger battery that we sell here has three temperature options as you can see which should be indicated by the different color in the LED it has a good high capacity but again it's very simple charge at the bottom three temperatures but you would need one of these batteries if you want to get into let's check out these these wax tanks now that we just went over dab pen batteries if you want one of these tanks starting with our aficionado tanks which we have a ceramic and a dual quartz in you need more power and the more power can only be attained with the larger dad pen batteries you have a doughnut option as well as a dual quartz and these are thicker so that are going to require some more power but they also have the larger bowls so these are gonna work well but you're gonna need at least one of these stinger batteries or defender or sport batteries to power these babies up now we also have our stinger battery which is a ceramic doughnut coil this is for those taste aficionados it's a standard ceramic doughnut ceramic body all around this pairs very well with our battery as well as these other ones but you don't want to run this one over 12 watts so it does acquire more power than the stick batteries put out but you don't want to overpower them with any of these big batteries that I had over here so you have a stinger then if you want to step it up we have our dual chords very popular tankful last year or two is our hybrid it's a dual quartz bull and it has this open chamber so you can really see the vapors really good taste purity has a very large sized bowl and dual quartz this is a good unit in that 15 to 20 watt range to really step up the power if you're hooking it up to a bubbler I mean this thing puts out a lot of power but you're gonna need more than just your slim stick or concealed batteries to power it up so again that limits you into the stinger the defender of the sport battery then if you really want to go extreme pun definitely intended you can go with the extreme tank which you can run on a triple course as you can see here I mean these are monster triple courses in the bull this is our most powerful tank I mean people compare this thing to a pocket rig because it really puts out rig style power you can have the triple course or you can have the big ceramic doughnut we sell both coils and both options do come in the kit for this thing you are actually it is so powerful that you're gonna need more than a stinger battery to power this thing up this thing isn't even going to give this the power that needs so you would be forced into the defender or the sport options for this so I hope that this part was informative on showing you what you can kind of mix and match between the dad Penn batteries and the wax batteries and also the wax tanks dab atomizers that you have here that are offered on honey stick a la carte so you can mix and match if this video was confusing for you you can always pick up one of our ready kits like our cannabis cup kit which pairs our stinger battery and our hybrid you can pick up our plasma kit which we didn't go over because it's not 510 thread so it's not mix and match this proprietary it has a cords coil that doesn't actually touch the concentrates really cool unique new pen we have our stinger which combines our stinger battery and our stinger atomizer for a perfect little ceramic donut kit for on-the-go if you're looking for something convenient and disposable we have our rip and ditch now for the environmentalists we aren't promoting running through these things these are for a matter of real travel convenience should be kind of a last resort from there if you're looking for a pen that you want to dispose of so we're not promoting throwaway culture so if you're looking for something small caliber check out our name Dabra kid it combines our silencer and our twist battery kit fully rechargeable awesome little kit so very inexpensive - so you could definitely step up from the disposable to that and the small caliber kids if you want a little bit more but don't want a lot of space we have our aficionado kit which combines both these nice atomizers that I showed you earlier let's take a little look which has a ceramic doughnut as well as a double quarts large sized bowl this is actually a 5/10 battery high capacity it even has a place for an apple charger on it for a rapid charge very small slim sleek very cool pen but it is wider than the slim tanks then the slim batteries that we went over so it's gonna put out good power so real good end between unit then if you want to go extreme you like that that pocket dab rig kind of feeling that gives you the max power that's kind of the cream of the crop the Best of Breed we have our extreme wax kit on our site for a really good price of 129 it comes with an extreme tank a sport battery the two coils and the mouthpiece and are in a different mouthpiece here which two mouthpiece options from the extreme which is really really a beast it comes in this awesome hardshell case for your on the go it is probably the best large you know still pocket-sized large caliber large output wax pen kit you can get super high quality the combination as you can see here is really really like they were made for each other I mean just look at the silvers and stainless as complementing each other here I mean this is this is a gorgeous kit and you're not going to find something that can fit in your pocket your purse or whatever that is more powerful and hits like this thing then if you want something really unique the reason we didn't go over any of its parts is because again it's not 510 but you want to be concealed a Ripper 2.0 has a beast of a wax atomizer in there it's a large bore large output dual quartz wax atomizer in there that is full concealer that is subohm caliber so as you can see this concealers this big butt has basically the same power as these larger batteries it's a unique proprietary blend looks just like a little lighter even clicks and flips like one buttons right there only one temperature little extendable mouthpiece if you unscrew this just mouthpiece the wax atomizer comes out you you don't screw it take a look at those dual quartz coils we're talking about monster concealer hits in here very high sub-ohm power those are thick coils and they get very very hot you'd fit a good amount of wax dabs into there and it's gonna be really good use but it's not a 5-10 thread it's its own proprietary magnetic bottom so I hope today's video was informative about getting you guys up to speed on wax pen

nice big torch right beautiful that's exactly what i needed so i got gotta get used to get used to that thing what else did i get here all right uh i did get a new optimizer for my puffco but uh i do not think it is the right one so i might have to uh take this thing back you heard me i might have to take this thing back if it works for my for my uh puffco thing then so be it i'll use it but if not i'm gonna have to take it back i'm saying that because the same pleasure i know how you guys don't like to take [ __ ] back ain't give me a receipt and even offer so i mean my shit's on mine everything's in the in the [ __ ] there you know what i mean but first thing i want to show you guys um of course the rig it comes with a a normal uh flower banger right the normal ass [ __ ] flower banger and the one cool thing is about this if you have a round uh cartridge not like this you might be able to do it like that but if you have a round cartridge you can actually put it in like that in your ball and uh take a pull off of your pen which i have showed that uh in previous fought videos i bought a new box of dirt wipes shout out to [ __ ] dirt wipes and go anywhere without [ __ ]

pull this little guy out there check this out right so you heat the bottom up it has this weird looking coil type i don't know thing in there right but anyway how she explained it you put your oil when you have to heat it up and as you're you're hitting instead of the the reclaim coming out through this bank going into your rig it goes through here uh or comes back down and then up and then back in so therefore you don't waste anything it's always a cycle of of uh catching your recline so once again instead of your recline going in through here it goes down and up and then back into the [ __ ] that coil looking thingy there okay here's the aspect of that 15 okay 15 i'm just gonna sit that right there in the thing all right now let's see the actual main piece what i got you guys ready you guys know meme i like i like my little uh my little rigs but i seen this i fell in love with the colors uh this was sixty dollars ready check this thing out man i absolutely [ __ ] fell in love with it my normal size rigs you guys know it's kind of like a beaker right a beaker style um yeah i mean it does remind me of my other one there with this type style thing there but yeah check that [ __ ] thing out right uh only thing i'm worried about is these little slits you see these little slits there if they get clogged with oil uh it's gonna be a rough day you know what i mean but you guys know me i don't i don't let my [ __ ] get too [ __ ] dirty but uh yeah so that that's pretty much what we got from the head shop so check this thing out yo this thing looks sweet check that out right right down now let me get the banger they come with a uh a carb cap you guys the carb cap here all right nice big ass [ __ ] bubble carp cap and right as long as it's supposed to go straight up and like like that all right right up in the middle boom so that's uh that's everything i got from the head shop i do not recall the [ __ ] price on uh the total of what everything cost but i do know the rig was 60 that thing was 15. um the [ __ ] puffco thing was 25. this was i don't [ __ ] know it was like 120 something 130 bucks but anyway here we go so i'm going to try this out for the first time i'm just going to heat it up i kind of like sterilize it a little bit i'm gonna put some water in this uh new rig here and uh we're gonna you know do a dab but before i i do do all that i do want to show you and talk to you guys about these g-leaf cartridges okay these t-leaf cartridges i am not rolling over bubble wrap rolling over bubble wrap i am not too happy with them liquid live carts by g leaf um they didn't even last me a whole day to be honest like they were [ __ ] the headspace is just [ __ ] killer okay i bought four of them actually i bought five of them but one was distillate but so i bought four of them of the [ __ ] live resin fse full spectrum extract cartridge right here's the la chocolate i saved this one because i wanted to uh like do like a little review on it right i don't know what this one tastes like but i will tell you the um the star dog was the only one i liked i didn't like the [ __ ] the uh what is it pineapple skunk pineapple skunk live resin cartridge i did not care for uh the taste was was that's that's actually a good one there the taste is just yeah it's terrible i don't [ __ ] there's another nation so i'm just gonna say like they're nothing compared to cresco cartridges um i'm gonna hold off from buying them from now on g-leaf like your live resin cartridge are [ __ ] whack and and to me it's a waste of money like i said uh i only smoke like when i'm on break like i don't smoke throughout the day like like a normal person would like that you know just constantly puffing these [ __ ] so like i think maybe i don't know it's i don't smoke a lot it's what i'm trying to [ __ ] say and it didn't even last me a whole day which is [ __ ] ridiculous but oh with that said i do want to open up this one on camera and give you guys my opinion on this one here okay so as you see it's not opened all right not open you're gonna crack this [ __ ] open bomb there it is now check out this headspace okay all these [ __ ] headspace or just killer i thought cresco was bad like my wife is really tired of me saying oh headspace headspace headspace but look at this look at that guys that's crazy now i could say oh it was sitting down inside yeah it was sitting down inside but still i can heat this [ __ ] thing up just a hair just to get it warm and uh you will [ __ ] see the headspace in it this is crazy like i know this [ __ ] sucks into the wick i know it settles and you know i know all that but i'm just saying like that's pretty rough guys you know what i mean you're paying top dollar for for your medicine like i expect uh i expect some some you know some full stuff you know what i mean can you really taste it but hopefully that that heated up enough i mean you guys can tell just about how much head space is gonna be right down to that [ __ ] base of that coil there i can't [ __ ] see it but while we're waiting for that to uh that bubble to go down you're gonna let it sit right there um stop hating on on geely [ __ ] live resin cartridges because they [ __ ] suck and i'm never gonna buy them again uh unless they actually change something about it but like i said the only one i did like out of those four is the [ __ ] star dog that one was not bad at all but getting into the tea leaf that i did buy i did buy a two gram jar of mai thai cured sugar okay and that is right here and i'll tell you what guys this stuff right here is [ __ ] fire look at it [ __ ] fire i would suggest if you got that on your menu from g leaf there in frederick or even in rockville go pick that [ __ ] up like asap once again i'll show you guys the numbers real quick there's that cart falling over on the side that's a wrap get that right there's the numbers stay stick okay so um i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video heat

that's it for today peace", "kXiJU_pfwto": "look at this oil over her eye poll you should look at this oil look at the color on that that [ __ ] is like homeless [ __ ] white gosh it looks like vegetable I need to say this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card like I actually do myself I don't I show you my personal information alright yo what's up guys are on your way back out true so I have another cartridge review for you guys in this video so I actually picked up two strains of his brand like I normally do but I only take apart and they have the Ewell's guys watch my video as you guys would probably know that I saw like I said I never tried I never like purchased these myself but my friend had one of these a couple days ago and I like guys I tried it like it's my friend let me like hit his pen so I have try these but I have tried these before and I was like actually like really impressed with them I'm not gonna lie and then like a couple days later that guy seemed to buy one get one free deal on them so I figured like their [ __ ] fire I liked them so why the [ __ ] not pick them up and also never did a video on them so it's like a win-win situation you know I mean I get some fiery cards for myself get some fire video is for you guys so um you know they man but well it's by the brand Delta eight I'm not sure if this is like a Arizona based company right I don't I don't know too much about the brand to be honest with you I probably did a little bit of research before making this video but if you guys want I guess this is their website history and that little shiny font just I lava calm so yeah Delta eight either or I guess the brand is I lava I guess that's like that's actually the brand nature this is the brand is I lava and unusually Delta eight cards so yeah got a little bit mixed up there but the brand is I lava and then Delta eight clarity that's the cards so you see I got Clementine and I got a pineapple Express so I got two different strains here this video we're gonna be reviewing the sativa the Clementine you guys want to see a video on the Pineapple Express so I'm gonna down below in the comments and there you know that that output the Clement time so like I said the brand is just I love but Delta eight clarity that's the name of the court so it's made with solvent free distillate it says it's obviously a sativa it's just around Clementine here's the front of the packaging I like how they put all like them I don't know what you really call this just like the colorful the colorful letters you know I mean it's just like a little small detail that makes it look good then the harvest day was for 24 yeah she was really nothing through fancy about the packaging I'll let you guys look at it real quick so you already showed you guys the front that's the front the side just says like don't store and like extremely blah blah the back thing like just as the Department of Health 1 and side besides the sticker you bend your back to the front there's nothing on the top and bottom just pull it out and then that's the little seal so I guess I said you know if it's been open or not so just open this up though take it out of the box nothing else in there this is what you're greeted with so that's looking [ __ ] stupid fire already in my opinion this packaging it's [ __ ] dope too like underneath the car says uh what does I say hashtag I love already I don't know that's pretty good out of the way we'd like the packaging look at this oil over hood like holy [ __ ] look at this oil look at the color on that that [ __ ] is like homeless [ __ ] white flash it looks like vegetable oil Voki you know what i mean like i should looks like water like that's just crazy let's look at the bubble [Music] yes and you see that should stick his [ __ ] the consistency should suck not moving the color [ __ ] is [ __ ] insane like look at that [ __ ] the clarity is [ __ ] insane you can see right through it [ __ ] read a book do it if you really wanted to yeah now that [ __ ] looks insane so let me know down below in the comments what do you guys think of it cuz I say it in every review but even though this is like my review we're gonna do I'm always curious to know what you guys think of it and um I forgot to say it earlier these parts or I think they're originally $60 but I've got them on the buy one get one free deals like I don't feel like 30 bucks each you know what I mean so 30 bucks each this is [ __ ] fire in my opinion I mean having smoke - yeah but just based off the looks you know I mean I'm happy didn't really go into that detail but like I said that's their website so if you wanna check my yeah if you want to check them out just I love the calm and every try this brand coming down below in the comments what you what you guys thought of them but let me take these little rubber pieces off and I'm just gonna be using my little basic CB 5 pen on this the homie over at CB 5 some company you actually hooked me up with this pen does that mean I think it's pretty [ __ ] dope I like the way it looks so I'm gonna use it but it's just the basic pan has like low medium high temperature settings and I'm pretty heat it's just a basic pan you know I mean nothing special but I'm just gonna put this [ __ ] on there we got the car in battery um one more look for you guys look at that [ __ ] beautiful oil that [ __ ] looks like I don't even know this looks amazing I sew climbing time sativa I love without the a carts um I guess the way we'll go over this is um I have like five factors that all like the importance reviews or whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it on you know what I mean so the packaging and the aesthetic looks of it kinda already went on with that so I'll give that like that uh the packaging I'll give like a four and a half out of five it's so close to a five out of five I just wish they had like a little bit more information about the car and what you're smoking on the package and you don't I mean like if you've seen some of my other reviews you know some of the package and it says like what terms they use and just it gives more like information you know what I mean I wish this part or at the packaging would give a little bit more information about what you're smoking on but it's not really too big of a deal I guess you know what I mean but especially because it's from a licensed dispensary so you know it has to be always like [ __ ] clean you know what I mean but so the package in 4.5 out of 5 extremely close to a 5 the looks and the quality of the concentrate so this is like this without the taste high or anything just the looks I'm gonna give that a [ __ ] 5 out of 5 because that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] amazing that quality you like the thickness the consistency the [ __ ] uh clarity does everything about it bro it that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] insane and like I said if you guys disagree or if you guys just want to tell me something down below in the comments just let me know what you guys think like this [ __ ] just looks crazy like the color on how you know what I mean but the looks definitely got a 5 out of 5 so next up we're gonna do a taste test so alright so I have on the lowest temperature now I'm gonna preheat this out and then I'm gonna give a little taste test and then ice available do with a little high test I'll blow a couple fat like the taste test I'll do a couple small hits and see how it tastes the high test of capable a couple fatter it's see how I like smokes and all that [ __ ] see how the high is I'll go over the price point I guess I find out are doing over that a little bit but I do like that and then after that I'll do like that um I thought overall review like review the whole code um you guys are smoking long cheers I hope you guys are smoking something dank alright so yeah like I said if you guys are smoke but a long Cheers I hope this [ __ ] tastes [ __ ] fire and this [ __ ] get it Cheers [Music] oh yeah you definitely get that that Clementine that Clementine the Clementine tastes like right after that like get a straight like Honda sativa I mean it's obviously it's a sativa but you get that straight like sativa tation I mean you can find up like a citrus lemon lime taste yeah it definitely has like that lemony like citrus like Clementine is for sure 1% and difficulties that definitely [ __ ] fire I barely didn't really even hit it too hard and just saying I'd rather decent cloud these lights make it kinda harder for the cabin to pick up the smoke sometimes up a lot more smoke than it actually looks like but no this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire like that [ __ ] looks like the color of it still kind of blowing my mind bro like that [ __ ] is crazy I don't know this should it's like [ __ ] fire so far I'm gonna take like one or two minutes and then I'm going to taste the reading then we're going for the high test so Cheers like I said if you're smoking long list [Music] definitely straight that's pretty much all you really get I'm obviously you taste like a strong this little taste to obviously but on top of that you taste every strong like citrus lemon taste it straight Clementine like fire um a lot of cards kind of like I don't want like really name any cards like those shade and certain brands that I'm saying but I feel like some some cards or some like some brands that makes but like some brands that make cars that like will make out a card that's called like a Clementine card but I don't know they might use extreme specific types or some [ __ ] but in my opinion it'll taste nothing like the actual straining we're just actually tastes a lot like before this drink does you know what it means so and not only does it taste like does it taste like the strain it tastes [ __ ] good like it tastes good as [ __ ] so to be honest I think I'll get the flavor a 5 out of 5 this [ __ ] is [ __ ] fired the packaging looks packaging his [ __ ] dope the looks of it a [ __ ] fire the way it [ __ ] tastes fire the high I can already [ __ ] tell the highest air like I'm already feeling that I've barely even hit it and I don't know why I mean I haven't really smoked today and I'm gonna smoke before my car reviews maybe I while I'm doing a little bit higher but no this is definitely some stupid [ __ ] fire but I mean put it on the medium temperature now so I'm gonna take a powder hit to see if I can blow I'd like to see what kind of clouds I can blow you know what I mean and then you kinda see what the pie of tips I get you know what I mean so it's get into that now Sophie I just smoking along too and [Music] [Music] whoo [ __ ] all right yeah so now this is I can only tell this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um I'll give it one more if you guys I don't want to get too high though they still got a record that pineapple Express for you in a minute but um I'll get one more fat hit for you guys you guys are smoking along seriously Dan and I [ __ ] get it so I don't know if you guys have ever seen my video I don't know if you guys ever see my i'm just like the lead cart reviews but um these are actually [ __ ] $40 for a half a gram and i think there were like it's 75 for the full gram so these are [ __ ] way expensive I think I said these are what sixties it's $60 for the for gram I think I prefer these over those like the lead car it's a hundred percent like a hundred percent I would rather have one Indian and they're cheaper too you know what I mean so I don't know that's just my thoughts and opinions the high high rating the way it hits it blows clouds are you guys can't oh so it's like the white smoke finish it I'll get on that before the five the high definitely gotta go in between a four and a half like now I'm gonna give it a four and a half out of five cuz for a car to be a five out of five is like extremely hard for me because I smoke so much [ __ ] wax so like it's like a different I don't know you know you know what I'm saying I mean I'm gonna be like at this yeah the heart rate indefinitely gets like a 4.5 out of 5 it's fire as [ __ ] but like it's not not real wax and I'm saying before a cart super fire there um hi like I said it's like one of my favorite cards probably like on my top - oh for sure it might even like I don't know I gotta hit it a couple more times like finish these two cards off and I'll let you guys know but but now I can already tell these have potential to be like my like number one like favorite go to cards especially when they have like the fire one get one free deal is getting me that they're you'd always a [ __ ] granite I don't like funny you can't beat that price you don't I'm saying so please like when they don't had to deal with those $60 is that something don't be a [ __ ] pricey 75 bucks for the lead guard that's pricey useful so I like props to them for making it like cheaper than no read cards I just like the week or it's not the throw shade on them because there's a fire - you know I'm saying but I don't know the high is definitely there so 4.5 out of 5 the price point so I know it costs a lot of money to like make some quality this lit so I mean it depends though guys like these companies obviously buying this [ __ ] in like super polka melts you know their names sounds really getting like Luigi Christ isn't they're probably profiting a lot but if you're not buying it uh-huh you know what I'm saying it still costs money to make quality this list so but for the quality of this oil in these parts the price point is a lot cheaper than a lot of the quality cards on the market like like for example like this like the meat carts that's like like these are tricked like like these are just as good like if not better than the select elite cards and they're $15 cheaper you know what I mean so props the [ __ ] I lava for that [ __ ] but but I cannot don't say that's like the delete I [ __ ] love them to what I love I'm just trying to give you guys like an example down the name I don't find the rambling now but the price point I'm looking at 60 bucks is still kind of expensive but if you get the buy one get one free deal that's a [ __ ] steal so I'm gonna give it a four and a half out of five and then the overalls for the car there's gonna be a 4.5 out of 5 I really feel like the only factor would be is that they were about $50 or $55 for the full room not I mean it's $60 for a 4 quart it's like still really [ __ ] expensive in my opinion because like he's like in my area at my dispensary I can get three grams or like concentrate for like $60 not I'm saying so I'd rather have like actually three grams of wax and a [ __ ] card so I don't know how that works out but I guess for the conveniency and the portability you know legit it's still fire I don't know but the courts definitely [ __ ] fire over all sport but yeah I don't know the card still fire or four point five out of five is overall score like I said definitely pick them up in their area for ever see them favorite ride then let me know down below in the comments besides that if you guys have any requests anything guys want to tell me - I'll blow in the comments stops for that - Ronnie ray give the video a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do you know what to do be on the lookout for the pineapple Express video and besides for that peace out", "AZMrC0TjKdA": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive kind of think of it every day is a good [Music] alright guys back here for no [ __ ] video we out here got the bong ready to go your honor you know it is but today guys there's gonna be a short little vlog a little informative bug about fake [ __ ] carts guys because there's been a lot of fake ass carts going around and I don't want you guys to get cheated you feel me I want you guys to I want you guys to be able to smoke realize cars guys like I'm tired of people selling fake ass cars and it's just disrespectful guys so like today I found a guy who sells fake for all garden carts and I have a real raw garden this is a real rug or in the place that I got it from is verified I'll probably show you guys later that is verified just to prove you guys that it's [ __ ] verified and I don't know we don't get these fake cards off the street now we can't get the fake cars off the street but I can tell you guys how to tell the difference between a fake and a real [Music] as people have been selling fake cards for too long guys it started off with the brass knuckles and the dang cars and the mario cards like wind-up mario nigut if you smoke something called mario [ __ ] you stupid but um I hit him up this dumb just so dude that sells like treating cars on the street I hit him love and he's gonna come through real quick and when he gets here I'm going to show you guys what the [ __ ] the difference is but before that let me take a bong rip you guys already freaking know you know I'd be on my bong way of life all right I'm gonna get back to you guys in a few minutes I'm just waiting for him to pull up and we all will get these things all right before I um talk to him real quick he's about to come in in a few minutes I just want to show you that I got it from a place that's verified if it has the check mark and we maps that shit's verify so all these are verified and the one that I bought the other day I did a vlog on it you guys want to check it out with the link in the description it is a chocolate slurm alright guys I'm finally back and this is how you could tell the fake from the real pro so I got the dojo Kush I actually spend money on it and then I got the cherry slurm I couldn't find the chocolates learn that I had but I had cherries learn before and I know it's verified so I got that this is the rowan and this is the fake the first difference I'm gonna show you guys is you know the difference in the boxes the boxes are totally different I looked at that [ __ ] I knew was fake but I needed a box to get it so I said [ __ ] it take one for team but check yourself so this is Rowan and this is fake as you can see the font and the color are totally different see the fake one is more light green light green around while the real one is dark green start reading around and you can see the font is different too by the net weight and cartridge you can see that the font are way different see by the fonts on the date and of the other other information on here that's how you can see that's the first way you guys can tell a fake from a real so the other way is by actually looking at the cart actually I have to open it real quick give me a second guys so now the second difference is there's no see a caution on the card up see how the real one this is the real one you see how the real one has the CA on it that one didn't have it and then you can also tell by the color that's the third thing you could do is hell is by the color but honestly the color on these look super similar so I don't know but usually you can tell by the color guys and then you guys already know the last way is to like actually taste test the product but I already know it's fake but for you guys I'm gonna do it for the one time for you guys the wu-tang alright guys do not I'm just gonna tell you guys do not buy [ __ ] carts off the street like I already knew it was kind of bad when he told me that the cart was $45 that's a that's a signal that's a signal all in itself right there $45 boy that [ __ ] is 65 but I was just going with it I'm not I don't care I just needed a car either way you feel me but um it's 65 guys or more for these cars they're expensive and that's why they taste so good this [ __ ] tastes like a [ __ ] battery guys like it doesn't taste good at all it has no type of essence from the flower nothing like it might look similar this [ __ ] really gave me one with a fat bubble engine bro I just got screwed but um it's fake guys like I don't know let me taste this one [Music] see I wish you guys could taste this so you guys could tell this is that real raw garden [ __ ] like [ __ ] this fake [ __ ] but like those are the ways that you guys can tell guys I hope everyone's having a good day I just wanted to do a short little vlog for you guys because I just wanted to post more so I just decided to do something about karts because I don't know I feel like not too many people are doing the karts are they're not showing you the real fake ones like that are actually out there so I bought one I was like man let me show you guys like what the real fake ones look like let me just show you guys so I got one and I'm probably gonna throw it in the trash matter of fact just take this [ __ ] this is what you do with fake cards you take the fake cart and guys okay go to the trash can and you see the cigarette butts you throw it in with the cigarette butts so I hope everyone liked this vlog don't forget to Like comment subscribe and don't [ __ ] smoke fake cards make sure you go to a dispensary or get you got to get it from some reputable place make sure they're verified it's not worth your health you know what I mean so just get a verified one pretty much all you have to do is not buy off the street but [Music]", "rFboZt75oCc": "what's up guys ninjagos here we're going to fill up the uh the 1 mil syringe with the delta 8 this look got it in the in the uh here you fill it up to about your they'll take this to the line now you're gonna want to run this two cycles so you're gonna want to heat it up once get it moving good put it back in the microwave get it boiling again not with this in it just the water get the water boiling again put it back in there let it sit there for a couple minutes and you should be ready to fill now if you're worried about um terpenes burning off and cannabinoid loss and stuff like that then you'll probably have to do uh do it a little more professional and get you a heat plate with the magnetic stirrer but this is about the only way i know to do it and i've done it before so do all the in the water i'm gonna heat this up stick it on gonna pull up real slow do there you go feel the syringe pop this off or screw it off and then you get your one field just push it out let me see if i get it focused there we go just push it out you know you have to reheat it back up to push it out of course but push it back out and get it to a full even ground or whatever you want see if it's still hot enough to fill this no see you've lost your heat as you see this one won't feel because you've lost your heat it's clogged up so that's the trouble everybody's having right but it will work if you get it hot enough and you pull it slow enough that's how you do it but you said anything other than that if you're uh worried about it being too hot you're losing uh terpenes you're losing uh cannabinoids things that nature and you don't want that to happen then of course you'll have to do some uh upgrading right get you the the tools that the professionals use to put the stuff in there professionally but uh other than that guys that's about it delta a dislike being put into the syringe i mean i know it's not the most professional way of doing it but i guess if you have all the professional stuff to do it with and you wouldn't even know how to feel one right so anyways guys that's uh that's all i got i wanted to get that video out for a few of the people that watch and uh wanted to know it was a question that was asked a couple of times so try to get it out to you guys and uh hopefully i got some more videos coming soon so uh hit the like subscribe if

this side take that out boom so it's here let's go hopefully this is real you know some face shape but if it is Wow I guess it was 20 bucks that's pretty sketch but I was like I don't know maybe he's like running out well like nobody's really buying it I don't know why the [ __ ] it's 20 but Browns greens on boom I have this battery but I don't I forgot what it's called it's moving but very slowly

battery I'm gonna show you guys how it works here's to like turn up the heat look at this 3.8 here's the power button / the hit button to like press it to take a you know whatever I'm over this review let's go see how it tastes it smells like sugar smoke like honey I'm scared what I'm smoking honey breath okay I'm just hitting it tastes like [ __ ] sugar that's what I'm saying like what the fight this should taste like sugar like I don't know something sweet sweet sweet sweet oh it's cool I've heard of these before though the Bloom cards this kid in my class he would always talk about it he got so high that off like one blinker he was like darling he could feel it as soon as he was hitting it and [ __ ] this one I don't know like I feel like you overhyped it I don't know if you were just excited or maybe I just got a fake one I don't know like I don't know what the situation is right now but because it doesn't taste like wax you know it tastes like sugar do you like I don't know how to explain it let me take another hey you know I'm tripping make sure you guys are smoking with me not this for you yeah that should taste sweet as food people like overall I don't really know how to feel about this I don't know if I got a rule one ever I would have got it from a dispensary I would have loved it pretty good card for like cheap you know but I got it from a plug so that makes it halis good just like so scared to sleep I just got it because it was 20 bucks and I was like dude like that kid was always talking about is a lip mac and B get it I'm asked for their opinions yeah they like yeah they like oh froley like keep smoking they don't like it I'll throw it away book that I'm trying to get what you could get from like smoking pesticides and [ __ ] probably [ __ ] bad you know probably overall just sketch about it because I got a funny play basically because you know what I mean I've never picked up from that play I don't know if it rings fake shit's not gonna wanted to get my reaction to be oh you guys all that Tennessee doesn't really see how much place we're presenting it whatever I'm over this review I don't like it was a waste 20 bucks and I saw it at the dispensary and probably get it though cuz you know I know that it's legit this though trash trash absolute trash anyways hope you guys enjoyed this little review in the next video peace", "JYcC1RudsfU": "[Music] what is up guys but from hey buds have I got some exciting news for you from Rove for new disposable pens from Rove all the same flavors you're used to right now they've only got Skywalker og tangi and wahwee og while we the most popular flavors by far four row but check it out this is going to make your arsenal complete it's got 0.4 grams of oil same oil they use in their other pens but they've made it disposable 0.4 grams you say that sucks well as you know the oil from Rove is a lot thicker which means the battery needs to be a lot hotter for that oil to burn so instead of getting a half a gram or even a full gram in a disposable you get halfway through it the battery dies you're pissed off you're at a concert or you're somewhere where you're using your disposable and and it doesn't work so what they found is this is the best combination for the consumer so there you go hot off the press if your dispensary doesn't have it yet get on them find out when they're getting them and load up I'm sure they're going to come out with more flavors in the in the near future and I will let you know when that's happening but right now check it out disposables everybody loves the disposable so there you go hop on it let me know how you like them I've only had it for a day and and really loving it so hope you enjoy like subscribe share the video

you tell that it's fake i got a fake plug play guys these are real i talked to them after that video or actually while i was making the video and told them what's up and they hooked me up with real ones these look nothing like the ones that i brought to the lab you could tell they're [ __ ] different today guys i brought the man himself peter from plug play yes the guy you see on plug plays instagram all the time i brought peter he's gonna actually sit down with me show me and show me how i can tell everything's fake how to tell their bad how to go through all the packaging the seals everything because honestly guys i mean i got played so i have no knowledge in this but let's get started so guys here's the investigator dopaziola again my homie has somebody i told him i was doing this video and he says oh i have a homie that makes fake plug plays and i go hey man can you get me the guy's [ __ ] number so i could talk to him and see how cheap these [ __ ] carts he's doing

play cards i know that he said that you probably haven't cheaper than my guy how much if i get 500 they're they're 10 bucks for the cart package and everything ready to go do you do a price break at a

is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it brown and yellow you see it there's yellow chunks in here why oh it's dead leaves oh it's trim oh this is true so guys this past month has been pretty wild we did exposing fake cards which led us to this because you guys asked so much how to spot fake cards how do you know if your cards fake how to spot fake packaging i'm so sorry i got you so high man but that's just that's what happens sometimes over here peter thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to first off go to the trap spot and get all these fake ones and then bring some real ones just to show us it was super informational dude even like i said even i got played i had no idea how to spot these because they look so [ __ ] real this has been how to spot fake carts with plug play thank you so much guys for watching pass this information along thank you guys so much for watching i'm dobaziola have a dope ass day oh [ __ ] damn i", "Z3QMe5rXwUU": "[Music] what's up club lives are here and today we're talking about fake cartridges there are so many cartridge friends out now carvanha flavor brands jetty extracts heavy hitters king penn exotic cards so many brands and manufacturers now it's very difficult to figure out whether or not the product that you got is a clean genuine cannabis cartridge so we have 5 ways for you to determine whether or not what you're puffin on is the real deal if you feel in this content and you want to see more videos like this hit that subscribe button down below the like button shoot me a little feedback in the comment section we're trying to build community here so let me know packaging on legitimate genuine cannabis cartridges are very distinct and there are a couple things that you should look for a genuine cartridge we're gonna use this carvanha here for example a genuine cartridge always has the potency information listed on a sticker as opposed to printed on the box so if you see here the carvanha the carvanha potency is on that little white label I could peel it off with my finger if I wanted to that's not necessarily true for this flavors brands which claims that it's 91% on the box I can't take this off the reason why this is an issue is because each batch of oil needs to be tested individually depending on what state you're from every state regulates the cannabis oils differently and a third party has to test these not and ready oh gee so there is no way that they can know that this is 91% if your package comes with the potency pre-printed on it it's probably fake [Music] next is the bubble test if you don't know the bubble test is check out my video on streets disease versus legit disease will be bubble test of streets is e and aced is e that I pick up from the clinic and the bubbles move at different rates high quality cannabis oil or distillate moves a little slower than whatever junk they're putting in these cartridges so I'll pull the bubble test for you guys for my example cartridges for you to see but this is a great way for you to tell if what you're getting is booth and homemade or the real deal if your bubble races to the top is probably fake so we're doing a classic bubble test to compare our raw garden cartridge to this flavors brand and andragogy cartridge compare how fast these bubbles are moving you can see for yourself which one has the thicker oil [Music] the next way to tell if your cartridge is fake is brand recognition packaged counterfeiters have gotten very good and there are certain brands that they are known to counterfeit repeatedly brands like kingpin Stiggy plug and play oh man I've seen stuff called pissing excellence there are certain brands that don't have the cachet as a lot of their legal counterparts if you live in a if you live in a illegal State this may be harder for you to ascertain but for the most part if you here in California or in Nevada most brands have a well distinguished brand identity you should be able to Google their name find their website find out information about them if your cartridge is lacking in any of those areas it's probably fake the next way to tell if your cartridge is boof is through the cartridge design itself most manufacturers who exist in the legal market try very hard to distinguish themselves from the pack there are so many cartridge brands out here but this is the hervana C cell you see the custom bottom here a unique great tip here is the raw garden C cell note the plastic on the tip and the bottom and then at the bottom there's also an embossing like a chrome embossment saying raw garden extra touches extra touches now if we're gonna if we're gonna compare that to our suspected Street cart this andretti OG it didn't come with a tip on the top not nearly the level of customization here not nearly the level of customization and personal touch that you would find on other brands so if your brand is lacking in some of these little accouterments might be booth last way you know whether or not your cartridge is legitimate genuine or fake is through the taste test sometimes you just know if you get an uncharacteristic burning in your new clean your mucous membranes like your nose or your mouth or the back of your throat it might be a boof cart get brands are known to add things like MCT or botanical terpenes that may add a certain harshness to your hit however trust your instinct on this one if it's burning too much if it feels really uncomfortable if you're finding a little bit of irritation in your throat or your nose after vaping one of these it's probably fate well that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure to LIKE and subscribe hit those lows uh that's it you guys thank you for watching be sure

or no is good click that Bell so you guys can notify it every time we upload and like always everybody yeah I love you guys having a good day yeah", "OM5r3zFdvPg": "so real quick before I even start the video I figured the reason you clicked on it was to find out how to see if a Wankel oil card is fake so let's just go over that really quickly first up the Wonka oil label will be raised but every individual letter will be embossed into the packaging as you can see this is raised but every letter is like the same texture so that's not a good sign secondly up here it should say Wonka's Cecil not Wonka ceramic and thirdly there should be a sticker in every package that was your quick thirty second guide on how to tell a real Wonka oil cart now let's get into the video [Music] all right hey guys what's up it's you boy mr. bling seat back again with another video today I'm gonna be doing a little rapid-fire review of these Wonka oil carts I am 99% sure these are fakes but as I'm unboxing them I'm gonna actually like look at them very closely and confirm whether or not my suspicions are correct um so yeah let's get into it I'm gonna start by looking at this trainwreck Wonka oil cart the reason I think that these are fake are the boxart for starters it's a lot more faded than the actual box art you'll get from Wonka loyal carts 'as it has the same writing on the back as the normal packages from what I can find online but the thing is when you open a true Wonka oil cart and you pull it out there should be a stick I don't have a sticker they come with a little Wonka oil sticker so you can like put it places and I guess the fakes they didn't decide to like recreate the sticker that long ago oil gives the cart feels heavy the wax looks a nice color and let's see if it moves at all it looks like it's barely moving so that's a good sign for this being a fake cart but that being said even that TKO cart I looked at uh moves really slowly also there's a white ring on the inside of the cecil atomizer and a lot of you guys in the comments have been telling me that the white ring means that it's a fake sea salt atomizer so that also is discouraging considering the fact that like you know you're buying these carts you want to have good atomizers with them the wax is still barely moving but that just could be because they mix it with something hella thick so I won't be able to know the quality of the distillate until I actually get to vape on them so imma go ahead and open the other box for you guys just so you can see that one maybe that one's like a real cart um but yeah I'm open the other box and then we'll go ahead and take our first puffs okay so next up we're gonna be opening the savage easel Wonka this one looks like it's already been looking a little bit before that's discouraging I don't think whoo I got these from would take out the stickers but like they're still out there here's the card let's check the wax quality same as with the last card it moves barely at all like that I'm really happy with it and I'm really hoping that these end up being decent because like I'm tired of buying really crappy fake carts it's got the white ring which means that it's a fake see cell atomizer so just like the other current I'm pretty sure this one's a fake so let's go ahead and puff on them see if they taste good at lease or if they hit hard and then hold you take a day to review them like usual and I'll come back at y'all tomorrow all right so to cut down on time I already loaded my vapes with the carts this is the train wreck and this is the Sour Diesel oh these are DAB cap compatible so I'm going to be hitting them through the deaf cap as well as hitting them just through the vape so first off we're gonna go with the sour diesel off the seesaw silo just to hit it see how it tastes and see how it rips so cheers guys okay it's not hitting like immediately and I don't know if I've like screwed on my vape thing too tight so let's see if that was the case okay so no it wasn't the fact that I screwed on my date base too hard it's just not hitting this is gonna be really disappointing I'm unscrewing it and it smells like how these discipline cards usually smell like so I doubt that it's like fake fake fake fake like a bad fake so let's just try it one more time I'm not even getting a draw on it I don't understand what's going on okay I might be experiencing technical difficulties with my silo so I'm gonna see if it hits off the m3 so cheers on that hopefully oh that tastes really good that actually tastes amazing there wasn't that much draw resistance on it at all after hating it off of this battery um the taste was amazing and it felt really smooth if you notice I didn't even call and I'm pretty sure I got a good vapor cloud so I'm gonna hit it off the dab cap real quick just to show you like how it will rip through a piece so cheers on that [Music] [Music] it really does taste very good so like I'm a fan of that that's the train wreck so after trying nated the Sour Diesel off of the Cecil m3 I noticed that it didn't even work either I'll show you guys real quick it's not hitting so I'm gonna have to transfer the distillate from this car to another atomizer and hope it works then so I'm very happy I ended up buying an actual Cecil atomizer so before I get to the other half of the video I'm just going to take one more rip of this trainwreck through the dab cap through this guy cactus right from pepper and then we'll get to the other half so I will see y'all tomorrow Cheers [Music] and that really does taste amazing I'm very happy about this train wreck at least so yep see you tomorrow guys all right so rapid-fire review on both of these carts first off the Sour Diesel after changing it to a sea salt atomizer easily my favorite out of both of these this cart hits right up with the grates of this channel like the dab woods carts and the dank vape I'm going to show you it through the dab cap real quick and then I'll talk about it a little bit so Cheers alright so the sour D it's like a tank three rips out of a dab cap is amazing with this cart it's easily enough to get you a good buzz and even sometimes get you high depending on how long your hits are five hits and I am fried for a good two and a half to three hours I would highly recommend getting these carts but if they're fakes switching them to better atomizers because I'm sure they would hit better that being said the train wreck it hits alright just not nearly as well as the Sour Diesel out of that new atomizer that being said this one worked from the box versus the other one where I had to actually transfer it thoughts on this cart the highs are okay but they take forever to get I think six rips from this cart or what gets me high and I have to like keep smoking just to keep the high going um the high off of this cart can best be described as just feeling tired and kind of heavy headed but also relaxed so that was a good thing um the high on the Sour Diesel though was very energetic it helped me focus a bit so I was very excited about that but yeah let me go ahead and take a rip out of this through the dab cap just to show y'all and then we'll go ahead and wrap up [Music] so as you can see the cloud wasn't as good but it was still pretty smooth um but it's not really gonna get me high it takes quite a few rips out of this atomizer to get me high overall I would give the Sour Diesel in this new atomizer an 8 out of 10 and I would give the trainwreck in the regular atomizer a 6 out of 10 that being said they both got overall positive reviews so I have something special planned for our final hit we'll be right back so this is something I usually do for my friends on snapchat but uh I've hooked both of these carts up to the dually from hemp er and a dab cap so I'm gonna hit them both at the same time through a rig I'm gonna try to do a blinker so uh stay tuned for that let's go so you know nothing can mentally prepare me for doing this but anyways if y'all made it to you into this video thank you so much please like and subscribe and leave in the comments some ideas for other upcoming videos I have a few ideas but I'm always looking to like see what y'all want to see on the channel I plan on doing a timebomb for a thousand subs cuz we're about to hit that I'm so excited and thank you all for 500 like I think that time I'm uploading this out be at 600 but like I'm blown away by the support I'm receiving thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart and there's blinkers for y'all so let's go cheers guys [Music] compilation' bees", "Herfl4POtvc": "today we'll be demonstrating how to make a terpene infused bait illiquid by adding specialized terpene solutions you can

full ceramic honey stick tank now a lot of comments that I've gotten in the YouTube channel since we've started whenever we're launching cartridges and emails I've gotten from from you guys of viewers as well as my extraction clients and partners that we make cartridges for is they want something that is a hundred percent heavy metals safe state of California as they have cracked down on eliquids and a lot of other things because they are definitely ahead of the health curve and an innovator in the cannabis curve has outlined that certain cartridges once they've been prefilled have contained heavy metals and those may be harmful for you so they are still testing all of that and not all the research is in but a lot of companies and a lot of you guys out there like hey I want a cartridge that I make sure there's absolutely no heavy metals in it because I don't want to take the chance and rightfully so so we had cartridges made and brought in and they're now available on our website that passed the phase three heavy metals test of California before we even brought them in our manufacturers had already been working with with California we told them the designs we wanted and these came back and passed the test because they are 100% ceramic on the interior ceramic on the exterior they use a ceramic heater and do not use any heating components that will set off the heavy metals test and also they're the only ones that pass all those tests with flying colors and we can really sign off on and say it lives up to the honey stick performance now all of our other tanks we have sent over we are testing and we will get those published as the industry moves more towards that but we want to be ahead of the curve and make sure we offer something for you guys so this right here our full ceramic cartridge we have them available and are already private labeling these for a lot of our extraction partners and a half mil size so that's a half gram and also the 1 gram size which is the one milliliter capacity cartridge now these are gonna be full ceramic interior body if we can zoom in and get a nice close-up as you can see you have a full ceramic interior body center post bottom base medical grade silicone gaskets sealing the bottom pieces which the blocks are also made out of ceramic and it has a ceramic heater core power plant now you say oh you know that's all good and well it's safe but does it vape up the challenge and yes it does these things definitely do hit hard and they vape well and because of ceramic in tin internals they're gonna maintain a really nice flavor of purity for all you purists up there you're definitely gonna get more of those turf tastes out of here because it is not interacting with anything except for the pure coated thick grade ceramic now the heater actually people say okay what's the orifice hole size now this has a unique orifice hole and I'm not sure you can a hundred percent get this onto the camera from this angle but it is a dual two millimeter valack kind of a moon shaped heater absorption system so you're still get a lot of good absorption you're gonna get a nice vape cloud it's not gonna you know run into any bad situations when you're putting the thicker oils or CBD oils or distillates in there you know this cartridge is made to perform so you also have the medical grade silicone internals as I said to make sure this thing is sealed up and doesn't leak and you have the the full ceramic mouthpiece that is gonna feel nice on the lips and is also going to be sturdy as well as easy to clean now these are not one use tanks however they are disposable so you could get a handful refills out of them as long as your key easier gentle with them because they are ceramic you do have to be a little bit more gentle with them even though the glass is a high quality of Pyrex grade glass you do have to be gentle with them because the ceramic internals are not metal and they if you bend them or put a lot of pressure on them ceramic does have the tendency when you put unneeded pressure on them to break so be a little bit more delicate with these tanks however know that you are getting a good bang for your buck now how do you fill these up and what are some of the tips that that I can give you guys when you're when you're filling these tanks and using these tanks because they are relatively new and innovative so when you have these tanks there we're gonna send them to you partially opened right there to make it easy you're gonna remove the mouthpiece and as you're gonna see you have a threaded ceramic shaft along with the little silicone gaskets these are gonna help give you the seal so you're gonna have the top mouthpiece that's also gonna have a little gasket that's gonna be a glass sealer because these threads are ceramic if you put a lot of pressure on them and twist because the ceramic threads have to line up you're gonna strip the ceramic and it is then going to compromise it's not gonna you know particle eyes or anything like that but it's gonna wear down and you are not going to have a good seal and if you leave your tank on its side they're upside down once it's been filled you do run a higher chance of leaking and you're not gonna have you know the fully sealed air flow possibly that you want so it might affect your rips as well so this is just a caution point this is why we do the videos so when you're putting them together you're gonna fill around the outside edges around the center posts you're gonna fill up with your oils or concentrates your CBDs and then you're gonna take this top and you are going to gently apply pressure and it's going to kind of stop and then you're just gonna twist and give it a little bit of prep just very little pressure and it's gonna take a little bit longer and then you're gonna feel the thread catch and the rubber gasket the glass is going to compress and as soon you feel the rubber gasket compress against the glass then you're gonna know that you are all sealed up there you go boom nice and sealed I wasn't pushing it out enough buddy there you go now it's nice and sealed it's flush I felt it it came to a stop do not overtighten the tank otherwise you're gonna run the risk of stripping it that's why I twist a little bit more times because I didn't want to put too much pressure on it I gave it a little bitty push it was enough I gave a little bitty more push and the thread caught perfectly and now it is all lined up it is sealed and you are ready to vape just remove this end cap here screw this on to your favorite 510 thread battery and yes this does work with auto draws as you see the little air hole on there I don't know if you could zoom in to see the little air hole so it does work with auto draws screw it on to your favorite battery and give this thing a try so again if you're looking for a purist experience something that passes the latest legislation inspections in the California

new Terrapin station the grand open on Mississippi here in Denver and as we were walking out we ended up seeing the little table for sphere X okay they have a they set up distillate cartridges one of the good things about it is that he were about this that he was shown is it's got five separate holes down at the bottom which allow you to it actually gives you a bigger hit show you right now it's very smooth to hit there's no button to turn it on you just charge it and you just go so the distillates we got today we got a mango Kush vape this is what it looks like the 500 milligram and what it says or what he was saying is that they reintroduced terpenes into it so you get most of the you know a bigger bang for your buck stuff like this the mango cush is a hybrid and as you can tell I'll show you what a big root looks like so this think it's pretty strong it's smooth if you get a chance to check it out it's spheric s-- no button batteries cartridges are easy there's no refill so

is the blinker guys let's get it peace y'all", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "f7h9Y6ZAHSo": "okay that's how you refill dizzy you'll see there's these little holes here there's an empty cartridge the first part is getting this thing off it's very hard on the gram carts I couldn't even do it here's the half gram but you just want to rip it off essentially put a little pull it sometimes you might use your teeth but don't ruin your teeth and there's the little hole and this hole actually is perfect size for the syringe so the syringe goes right into that hole if you want to and you somehow can't fit that syringe in there you have a different style syringe you could pop this rubber off just make sure that when you refill it these little things all line up and fit in there properly if there's not proper air suction it will not activate so we'll go ahead here and we'll do it the easy way which is you have a tip like this tip here's our still it syringe taking off screwing let's go right in that hole fit through it need to go south will happen there take it out but the other half in there there you go I don't even fill it all the way up that's fine it's good enough and then pop that back on and you got a refill it's dizzy cartridge yeah", "-DLv-IvXmsU": "okay what's up youtube so if you're here today you're probably wondering how to transfer thc oil from one cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up for you guys i really hope youtube doesn't delete it again because i think i fixed the safety violations that it got deleted for um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching like comment subscribe i love you guys so much peace out", "Sgs9cbojCTI": "[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today we do got a review it's a cartridge review it's coming to you by runts this is the obama runs i have i haven't never tried obama runs before not even the flower i seen this at burners in merced california it's a licensed cookies dispensary and i thought i would try out the runts uh cartridge this is only a half a gram it comes in the package like this let's pop it open it does got a little bit of headroom that you can see there i really don't like that uh it's got the seal on the top and the bottom let's get those off i got a fully charged battery here and on this it's weird the thc and everything the thc a is 10 and a half percent and then the d9 thc is 55 and a half percent and the cbd is at a point two percent so i don't it doesn't tell you the total on here it's kind of all over the place so we're just gonna try it out and see out see what it's like and i did do some research the obama runs is a indica dominant and this half a gram is gonna run you like like 45 bucks i think at uh burners in merced so cheers everybody let's get a hidden see what this shit's all about gotta turn it on oh and how they make uh obama runs is it's afghani crossed with og kush cheers yeah this is not live resin i want to say this is distillate as well it says on here to hit this one at uh low heat which is recommended 2 volts but this battery is the voltage is like you can change it and the lowest it goes is 3.3 so we have it at 3.3 off the first hit it's got a a good taste it's not fruity like they're adding [ __ ] to it it tastes like flour so i really like the taste and it was smooth we just got to see what the high is like because it feels a little light for me but you know we got to take a couple [Music] hits i do got a beer here i don't feel like doing the whole shoddy thing right now it's only uh [ __ ] 10 30 in the morning when i'm recording this so this is early beer and early filming for me i got things to do today 49ers play it one uh later on the lakers play so i got [ __ ] to do i gotta film early today okay off the first couple hits uh it's not bad at all this is all legit [ __ ] though it's got all the you know the seals and all the [ __ ] on it like it's all it's the real deal people i don't buy no fake [ __ ] okay so far i don't know i like an la cushion stuff this is okay but for the money that you're paying for it i don't know i might stick with the uh with the other ones that i've been smoking on this is probably more of like a cbd heavy or something cheers well it's not it's only a 0.2 but i don't know it's not like super strong on the on the thc this is one of those ones if you're a family function or maybe even at work and you still want to [ __ ] go throughout your day without being all [ __ ] up this one's probably perfect for you i think this is the first time i've ever bought a half gram too i usually go with the full grams but honestly it's not that bad it is it is pretty good i am starting to fill it now the more hits i'm taking but when you pay you know top dollar you want to feel that effect quick well i do anyway i've been smoking for a very long time my tolerance is extremely high so you guys need to remember that when you're watching my reviews my tolerance is [ __ ] high so if i'm giving some things like small like lower numbers on my reviews for some people that haven't been smoking that long it might hit you guys a lot [ __ ] harder you know so keep that in mind and the hot chip i am eating this uh i think i'm gonna eat it tomorrow i'm gonna film this tomorrow so you guys will be getting it in the next two or three days you guys will be getting that video somebody uh told me to do it live i thought about it but i think i'm just gonna go ahead and do it the same way i'll have the timer out and everything you know i've never done a live video before i don't feel like it's gonna pull in a lot of audience on my first one so i'll just stick to the video format let's get another hit in cheers hope you guys are smoking on something good having a great day this is sunday when i'm filming this you guys won't see it until [Music] monday morning yeah this one's on the lighter side i would like to try the weed the actual flower of obama runs and see if that's more of a you know if it's stronger if it has a hard punch to it or if it's mellow like the cart is so far and what i just did was i poked a hole in the back of this beer so it'll go down a little faster not like super fast but just gives it a little uh you know air ah okay let's get another hit in start calculating up the results here [Music] okay price this one this brand is pricey runs aren't cheap in any dispenser you go to it's a pricey brand you know it's well known it's one of your top of the lines it's up there with cookies and everything else so price it is pricey it's not your budget cart the the look of it uh it was a little low but it is only a half gram and it looks typical normal like every other cart that i've smoked on the uh the taste it tastes more like weed than it does anything else they like they didn't add any flavors to this or anything i can just taste more like weed like how the raw gardens uh ones taste the uh the smoothness is really good it doesn't you don't even feel the smoke going in or out at all and the high the high is mid mid range this isn't something that's going to put you on your ass at all it's more for someone that wants to function during the day still and and that's good for a lot of people a lot of people will like that you know me i just like to be stoned so um the functionable ones are always a little iffy for me that's why my reviews are a little lower on them you know so overall for the obama runs by runts vape cartridge i'm gonna have to give it the 7.8 because uh it's not it just don't get me high enough to get into the eights but the 7.8 it is real clean and it tastes really good and it's really smooth and i do feel the effects of it but i just want to be more higher when i smoke sorry so i'm giving it the 7.9 i mean 7.8 sorry not 7.9 7.8 some good stuff about it and some negative stuff about it i would say you have to try it out for yourself because not everybody's preferences are the same so i'm giving it the seven eight ah all right that was my review for the obama runs by runs hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] ah [Music]", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in handy go ahead and get liquid gold go to gene farmer labs calm and don't forget to subscribe to our G farmer TV YouTube channel", "xXKGA5iZFFM": "hello senior stoner fans the senior stoner back at you and today I have something I hope is pretty interesting I'm gonna do for you all I talk about it a lot but I don't do it in front of you this is the vapor slide take it apart battery the cartridge and the distiller notice that it's half-full only half-full so now I'm gonna open it but it's turning the mouthpiece whether it's white or black doesn't matter you still turn the mouthpiece counterclockwise to expose the inside of the vapor cartridge now there's no mouthpiece okay the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to heat the cartridge very carefully with a lighter I heat the top where you can see it's tip is metal I heat that and I heat the glass you want to heat the glass so your distill it becomes viscous so it starts to drip and move around inside the cartridge because as you attempt to drip the new distill it in you need to have a hot surface for it to come in contact with for this to work correctly you also want to warm up to distill it gently just a little bit in the syringe just to make it so it's easier to handle then you take the syringe and gently apply it directly onto the top of the cartridge touching the glass but pouring it in through the center you can see it filling up do you see it filling up gradually as I push the plunger down on the syringe it fills the inside of the cartridge with the distiller and this is one of my favorite strains tally OG which is gonna be mixed with what they're ready in the cartridge which is tangerine dream so I'm gonna have the best of both worlds I'm gonna have a real OG experience and then I'm gonna have the flavouring of that nice creamsicle that I tell you all about putting a little bit more on this side so it drips into that open space and also do not be afraid to retouch it with the white or again just so things go in smooth just give it a little touch on top like this so it goes in smooth now what you'll see is a completely filled cartridge you look all around it's completely filled then what you do is simply take your mouthpiece and reattach it by screwing clockwise because you're screwed counterclockwise take it off if you have any residual on the side what I like to do is take in a ready roll joint and just wipe it along the side you find that you get a really nice enhancement to whatever you're smoking by putting this strength of distill it right down the middle turn to Jimmy joint super into a Jimmy joint deluxe super and then we put our distill it back in the area belongs put our cartridge into it battery and begin to take a hit and that is how you fill a vapor slide two cartridges with your own distilling very simple easy process try to do it neatly don't leave too much junk on the cartridge if you can help it but it provides for an amazing experience just like that or the enhanced way I throwing it into a bubbler and doing it that way I hope you enjoyed this video on how to fill your own vapor slide cartridge please everybody have a great day and thanks for watching senior star", "on1oTL9jsH0": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title this is another raw garden video but it's not like a product review this is more of like a wake and bake hitting two cartridges at the same time trying to blink it and I know I what I've said about excessive smoking this is actually the first time I'm blazing today and we're probably just gonna do two hits off of each pin and try to blink both of them and we're pretty much done from there you know I'm not gonna drain the cartridges in any way I just want to see if I complained to maybe just twice you know saying so we're gonna start the video right in the [ __ ] [ __ ] so if you couldn't tell from my video the other day I got to half cap cartridges of raw card in as you can see right here good stuff we got both of them are indica hybrids and uh I just noticed the font is different on the top but oh well you know I'm saying I've got it from fie nose you see right here QR code and everything berry punch number two and Golden Eagle I'm saying I will post the crosses on the screen right here just on each side and I'm saying so you guys couldn't get a better understanding of what strains are actually crossed in here but very very good stuff these were $24 for a half grams so about 48 dollars total a full gram is 45 at my shop so I did so about buying a full gram cartridge would save you about 3 bucks but you only get one strain I get two and yeah we're just gonna get started from here just see the percentages so for the berry punch it's gonna be 82 percent or 83 let's just say 83 and then this one's going to be 80 point 74 percent okay let's just open it I'm kind of scared I've never blinked two pens at once so we're gonna be trying this so this one golden here here very very similar I did smoke some already as you can tell so try this friendly funds will go in the golden one I'm in the chill battery this one see if we can bring both of these at once do not try this at home voice no I'm saying my tolerance is a lot different than every tall everyone's person's tolerance is different so please keep that in mind my tolerance is a bit high so I do have to smoke a little bit more than a average person so I'm saying cheers boys [Music] that's Syrian think so a lot of you have probably been wondering about raw garden for a while and I've been wondering too you know their life resin is a lot lighter than other life resin cartridges and it's not like raw garden has hid anything from their extraction process maybe just a few secrets but I've read articles on Leafly where they're basically saying that it's this list so it's like raw garden has never hid the fact and then the fact that there were fine live resin is not really that much of a difference you know I'm saying it actually it's like kind of like the best of both worlds how distillate usually has higher THC percentages than let's say library but then if you reintroduce the strain-specific turts like it's it's all the same it's just a little bit lighter and it's not it's distillate mix with real turf so you know I'm saying usually distillate you're gonna mix it with like strawberry terms or grave herbs or watermelon herbs but what raw garden is doing and I'm not saying like I'm like a raw garden expert because I am far from that you know this is just what I've been reading online and please just take it with a grain of salt people are messaging me saying that they're a bad company but it's like you know they're not they're not a bad company they're certified they never like failed a test for pesticides and they never honestly never like they said refine life resins if you look up refine it means remove from all impurities in the [ __ ] and that's basically what they say on their Instagram you know I'm saying so no hate on raw garden is still my second favorite my first favorite is obviously Ursa but raw garden they're doing something right you know they really are and it kind of is like the best of both worlds if it is this late which I'm not sure it is they have the Hyatt they have the high percentages you know thing and what live resin is is it basically the flash freeze the plants and then they just extract it with BHO or closed a closed loop system and then you get the final product you know I'm saying and some some companies you know they and just put that whole product into a cartridge what raw garden does is that they distill it with some sort of method that they use which is only unique to them and then they reintroduce the Terps back into it like it's not really it's just like it's like doing math but differently you know I'm saying like two plus two equals four but then you put two plus one plus one you know I'm saying there's just a different way it just ends up kind of similar you know I'm saying I'm not saying it's the same we obviously know that live resident cartridges is usually a bit darker but like like I said raw garden has never been lying about anything you know and the cartridges are getting I'm saying so while garden fan till the end and respect to the people who has been telling me about you know whatever they think they're concerned with these thing they're telling me that there's like the housing 10,000 chemicals like come on really let's be honest you just ready you're spreading some weird rumors now so cheers boys I'm gonna do another blink you're probably gonna end the video here it's just like the video says I was just going to do a blinker with both pens at once and hopefully you guys enjoyed the video you know there will be another video of some King's garden so be on the lookout for that I didn't even open it here so yeah just I don't understand the heat for raw garden it's like raw garden never hid that fact you know they're gonna hide some facts of like their methods of extraction you know you can't really tell people what you do too much you know you gotta keep it a secret but like they never like hidden the fact that you know the alley flea article says that their distillate you know alley flea article shares boys [Music] no more we gotta put it down it's all like I said it was a wake and bake today so I'm definitely gonna feel this but yes both really really phenomenal flavors I'm not gonna lie and honestly that was all I need for this wake and bake um holy [ __ ] well yeah much love to a rock garden much love to ursa and all the other companies you know saying do your own thing you know I'm saying and uh I don't know it's kind of like the best of both worlds to me let me know in the comments what you think you know obviously we're going to have different opinions just let me know let me know your opinion on rawr and let me know what you actually think of raw garden and uh yeah we'll just get this discussion going you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music]", "lEWqmRfuw_E": "if you want a canvas patient or of age please fight off of

makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for

"what's going on baby family it's your boy fated Markie and today I'm gonna be comparing two things you guys I got a pod actually this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "oC1aQnM1UIA": "a min of vaping health scare the new hope police chief announced a record seizure of illegal vaping cartridges that contained the active ingredient in marijuana the bust happened in [ __ ] Rapids but was announced in New Hope because the lead investigator on the case is a new hope officer that officer was part of the Northwest Metro drug task force which sees 75 thousand vaping cartridges that contain potent levels of THC many of the cartridges were marketed toward younger users with names on packages like fruity pebbles and strawberry shortcake authorities say using illegal THC cartridges can be very dangerous because the ingredients aren't always clear I want to urge all parents have conversations with your kids your loved ones anybody that you know that are using these cartridges stop using them get help go to treatment have conversations about the dangers these types of products are available for purchase in supplier states that have already passed law as legalizing recreational marijuana if you think this is a problem now wait until cannabis products become commercially available in Minnesota this is yet another example of why we should pause take our time before passing similar laws in the state currently there are more than 500 people in the US with serious lung injuries because of vaping and that number is expected to grow", "P9gDUYwQYc8": "these THC shenanigans are for stoners ages 18 and up the [ __ ] is this [Music] yo yo yo what's up guys this is nugget fresh and California clouds this is stoner shenanigans and today working parents and pens let's get before we begin we just wanted to let you know that all products have been purchased lately from mankind dispensary to ensure authenticity alright guys we are back we got five you fate pens from five new companies if you haven't yet seen it check out our previous video where we compare five eighths from the top brands in California so what are you most excited about well today well actually if you guys watch any of our past videos you guys know I'm all about the canvas terms so today I'm really excited to try something new something I never tried guys and that is this guy right here this is some friendly farms guys I have never tried actual live resin full-spectrum live rather than in a pen this is no discipline this is just 100% live residents tucked in this pen that you don't add any extra turkeys with nothing guys nothing so this is going to be I think 68 percent THC yes it does you know it is somewhat low but you guys remember it's not his lip this has a full spectrum high so you know this high is gonna feel and be a lot different than any high you're gonna get a pen so waiting but I'm really excited just the first time I've heard of a pen this way I've always heard where you get your distillate you add your terpenes and then maybe once in a while other companies toss them the other things might be talking about that later but I'm just excited to be honest I'm a little curious about how it's gonna taste since they didn't have the trick things back in there but nevertheless let's get to it yeah that's good to it alright get over it I'm gonna try so as you know all these to be pens are supposed to be childproof tamper proof people true that sticker on it with a sticker Sarah oh yeah guys so we're trying this trade but its flavor I guess you could say it's called Chewbacca Chewbacca sure I don't know you guys can you guys can you put up that heavy suit you guys think it is but it's a hybrid and it's looking pretty good honestly oh also what is special about this mean this is a collab right with easioyya these farm stuff I think it's gonna be cool out stuff I do have stuff that the feds just took the straight line that's just from other farms and stuff like that so yeah we'll take a look at this one right now you know and I will plug you know close to three guys as always suggest and see how dark this stuff is and when I say dark I don't mean like bad door can I just mean it's big it's not it's not desolate rise it in take all you know the camp going turkey new tripping out of there and take all the bats what is and you know this is it guys this is your lever isn't just straight stuff doing then I am so excited right now of course we got our battery from the court officials perfect for this a 5-10 thread leaves ok so just making sure okay so we're at three point four guys and I think I'm gonna keep it back to repent for usually I'll go to point eight but since this is not dis lit and this does have like you know more of that's enough plant matter in it I I do want to burn out a higher temperature so if it doesn't taste like you know all that goes up into a point in yeah [Music] I've also heard before people say that they always wanted on a lower battery setting or so you can might taste the turkeys better and so this doesn't have champions that definitely makes sense yes yeah yeah yeah I like that it is so totally different at the lane that like that taste is like so natural wax doesn't say it smells kind of like the smell of like a for your job or like a bird but yeah that's awesome awesome awesome I could smoke on that all day long that's like up there with raw cardoons flavor honestly even though Gardens like almost taste like something that's not quite hitting that that's you know 100% locked and add flavor but it's the closest thing in the market right now and tell me right now until right now alright I don't think this you know actually does take precedence in flavors over anything I've ever tasted I mean it makes sense it's not you're not tampering yeah yeah it does remind me a little bit broader is I will say that I like the Terps yeah the terms relate to motors in this rail there no no no Rihanna trips because there's Turks nothing oh okay I'm sorry that's my bad it's just it that's crazy that's that's nuts so I'm going away so I don't know if you were to write this you know oh yeah one to tattoo the same all right guys so late personally I'm a bit I need to see you know raiding stuff like that just like total enjoyability and smoke and like just the way it made me feel the way that hey like actually went in like when I held it I guess it's like maybe it's just the distillate you know that like makes my nose like I like her a little bit like you feel it is - no not at all not one bit so I said that I'd be like perfect Penn High like I just feel like you should he give something in 10 just because looks like a hundred percent the best of the best but like I'll give it a nine point seven I mean like the flavor is ridiculous hi I will take that anger or anything else stick back flavor is just not late and then also you know feel like you know years old again you know or closest to a nice know or something you know I don't like that straight in your face I you think when you think of full spectrum highlight what do you think of like that body high like where it's like you for it and it washes over you or like I feel yeah it's more relaxing it's more calming it's more like a wave you know what I'm saying it's more of like it's you and then like a colic you ride it out you know what I'm saying whereas those wax and I feel like can you smoke it you know what I'm saying and then you get high for about 30 45 minutes and it really okay and then like you just boom I don't know yes there I just feel like you just you know you'll have a lot more enjoyable time with that miswak and I'm excited to take a date and literally just smoke this and just see how I feel like we actually got this from place box and then you were nice enough to include a DAB cap so make sure you guys check them out this dab cap will literally turn like almost any one of your vape pens like into a hittable like okay well actually we have figured that some bakers are more are better than others of lechery actually look at the tip of this this is let's hit similar to the tip that rock artists on it these tips will go really well fit the nasty sound so why not getting show [Music] [Music] so I just need to have my wits about me or I'm not gonna do this video so all right so no I think it's your turn to pick I know you're coughing dying right now just point and we got it for you I'm really excited to try this one I definitely can't wait to hear her opinions but yeah I think sighs this to me is just like you know on time coming I just I've heard a lot about them but I've never actually sat down and over the package of platinum bait and I just looking so you know it's a great price point fifty dollars for one gram that's [Music] that's pretty good a and honestly is right now I got from the farm sixty two dollars at for a half is a half way like I just said this my number one pen right now it's just beats it I'll be hard-pressed okay let me see if I can always struggle with the fast ones I do like the design those boxes no chopper just tells me I just taped over the chocolate you know and then [Applause] yeah they still put the they said with a little less of things on the I like that I especially like the talk please like if I put my all right I want to see you take the fattest rib out of that piece all right now see what flavor do we got white buffalo interesting have you ever heard it's gonna say I really like this packaging because there's the state of California in it I think that's pretty California and all right what do you think flavor-wise white buffalo I don't know what it tastes like but like like like a peach orange a little harsh which is crazy because you would think that yellow slime present would be streaming I get news okay you got this all right real quick rating Platinum v what do you think all right well as you guys can see it's it was a little harsh definitely $50 you know it's still it's great you know already but I don't know the flavor was definitely like reminiscing yeah of orange and if you had a baby I don't know if a white buffalo taste like that I wouldn't imagine but you know so I can't really speak on like what the flavor like you resembles but like did taste it yet he's good but it didn't taste like so so so yeah so yeah so these guys I'm actually kind of excited to try these guys kids these trying to think that via song they have you know cannabis terpenes cannabis oil you know Italy Italy also had some secret ball taxes yeah with like like a turkey I think yeah this is definitely a weird design guys and just like look at this right now there's like a little like swirl in the center of it which is kind of weird I beautiful is that and then there's also you know I mean this thing it's just one of the ones like right like the other side look at the comparison I'm already like really big so yeah okay sorry just be like all right all right enough talk about it this is Bubba a ping guys she's a bad beginning but I know sorry I'm okay go for it I'll tell you what everyone what I think it's definitely interesting when they see like floor equipment and cool I do get that little like maybe perfumey taste just a little bit and remind me a little bit of cheesy just a little bit like the taste so it's just I don't know go back and is business sweet if this is the kind of speech it's like really light though like it makes a good vapor it seems like you know you're like you're like there's like oh my god there's like an insane amount of like space like in this closed like it's closing [Music] it's not like I can't is maybe I'm just like I don't know I know it's just it's just not my favorite like this one TC if I don't be it and video tasted a little bit better later not like a little bit better definitely a lot bit better I think than that one but I'm still loving the friendly friends right now okay so well I I don't like everything I don't like a sugary taste too much so like that was like a light that's almost like a lemon is just a tight yeah really right so I was gonna do one but personally I wanted to be that wasn't taste in the campus but you have this week I believe this I can think [Music] like I love candy and so I think that's why I like containing our yeah that's that's why okay what we stopped to mourn we still got some competitors here you guys alright what's up next I don't I think I'm excited I kind of let me say about this one absolute extracts it's called dawn water oh gee so definitely wanted to try that when we saw it early yes like this is interesting okay and also if it's you art so I'm pretty excited about that yeah let's do it this is very interesting very cool that Conner Lake looks like like the top that you put on the pill bottle yeah I like it it's like yeah alright let's get into this push [Music] and so this is kind of cool right that we have Moxie tart and this is like straight-up kbx but it's for the dart system so it can just go into the dark absolutely we're told so since they even if you're taking an open eye they probably can't get there they do okay evaluate what they were doing eat you've had this very well here baby I don't even know why I'm Cheers [Music] oh yeah guys um but yeah I know that definitely tasted pretty good I kind of like want to just like puff on that a few times to like see how high that gets me exactly like it would get me like really live yeah it was interesting like you said though like definitely like painters thing it was like to me it tasted more of like - it's like that or - or something like it was good I liked it no like teeny like I feel like they didn't like a look at much of chirps in there anything like yeah yeah I think I'm probably had an eight with that one okay yeah I'm nerdy Nate - it's like eight like seven point five eight like yeah Joey it's just like the way the battery hit so like to meet I like fat hits I guess by the way is some healing effects like like doing if I could hit this three times I do it and just wing it didn't spark up that much and so I don't know me hey yeah okay yeah I think I'm at like seven point five I think like it's definitely like up there with your friendly farms oh yeah yeah yeah I know I won't lie it's good yeah yeah all right doesn't want you favorite so far I think yeah all right we got one left Alpine I just see these people on Instagram I've definitely been really

because i don't know if y'all can see how foggy this [ __ ] is outside it looks more less foggy on camera bro but that [ __ ] was like that's just pretty foggy out here well we don't usually get this foggy well sometimes we do i don't even know [ __ ] but this is the first time it's fogged in a while so and i got a little green box disposable review i started it yesterday in my room but i was like [ __ ] that i'm gonna do it today and yeah i have my ac on so if my ghost or my heat on so if my ghost go everywhere that's probably why all right so this is um kush cola it's just tasting like um

tastes like but with like a little bit of butter flavor the bud don't taste too good bro this tastes like some the bud don't taste like some name but i don't know i'm not gonna lie to you it tastes like some meat or some [ __ ] i'm wearing a cap but um yeah you do get that cola taste but that that that's just not like strong strong you feel me that [ __ ] is like light it's subtle you have to like [ __ ] look for that [ __ ] like get to really like pay attention to the flavor to fighting that [ __ ] oh no my tolerance is just high as [ __ ] or if these don't [ __ ] do [ __ ] to me but i

"ZHJqEUTD11U": "hey how's it going i'm here to uh make a quick review for this vape cart right here called the willys reserve oro blanco distillate card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye", "GIiZ4LCEEO8": "AOS popping them my name is Haley Anna to be my first video get your cartridge without any battery what happened to me was my battery just broke because these little shitty batteries are very bad they can break easily so I had to figure out a new way to be able to hit this way and yeah basically what you're gonna need is a phone chargers don't work for this you have to use Android chargers [Music] yeah and you're just gonna cut the tip of your Android shower off and pending on what type of engine charger you have two wires or four wires the only two wires that you're gonna be using is in the black wire and the red wire so there's any other colored wire basically skip those all the way down and pull these ones out to where things are the two only two I know so yeah and then the next step to do is actually have it so the wires are protruding out of the way I did this personally was I grabbed a pair of nail clippers and I lightly clipped down and then I pulled so that's the wires conclusion for treating out you this anyway Louise his way that I found to do it oh yeah you actually have to have it so um I guess um I'll just show you guys how to hit it want you guys to do all of that with your Android charger you're basically just gonna plug it in to any port and then make sure it's plugged in and so how you hit it is all right there you're gonna take a black wire inside of there the red wire on this side [Music] [Music] yeah it's really good [Music]", "iX7Zcy6J0-Y": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we got another educational review yet again everybody we do not condone these products this is an 18 and of Education review from the cannabis patients out there but today everybody we got another King pen I decided to pick two up just because I know I noticed that I've reviewed King pen before this is a King Louie og by the way some indica I've noticed that I've I've only copper King pen like once now I just had to review a second one and now this is my third one that I'm reviewing on this channel I think this is the third one that I'm gonna be on the channel but this is some King Louie we got it right here shout out Disney's for sponsoring this video this is actually a glow-in-the-dark shirt but it fits perfect for the King Lily so shares everybody oh wow this one makes a lot more fatter clouds in the cartridge video I did before so you guys have watched the Kali the Kali oh oh I wasn't actually make able to make big clouds and I'm like okay maybe it's just the airflow of the cartridge but this one is the exact same size and last time I actually didn't have it on the lowest temp so let's go back to the lowest ten I like taking them low temps just so for the flavor the last one we did was Callie oh and again let me let me take another hit Lucy oh yeah something's wrong with the other cartridge that I did haven't talked about at all like damn is this what happened that color went out of the airflow this one I'm already late with this one with the King Louie just literally like to dress oh that flavors nice mmm has like a cereal taste to it like if you guys ever tried um what is it rice krispies or crispy rice crisps you know there's Cocoa Krispies and the other rice krispies the colorful ones pebble pebbles I think pebble crisp dude I honestly don't even know like a fruity yes I got like a sweet fruit type of type of flavor which is pretty nice and I'm not gonna lie damn King Penn what's up with that man I mean we got the callee oh that [ __ ] did not hit well you know what's funny to some of them actually don't hit well like I've noticed that this that wasn't the first time so if you guys watched my previous video on the kingpin Caleo review um I wasn't able to take like big ribs like this one like I wasn't able to make some time like you know nice clouds oh this one you can make some nice clouds and it tastes nice just the one thing is indica so this just about having me slept but damn that's funny cuz I remember I had a I had a friend that actually bought a half game card to we're hearing it and we're both like what the hell it doesn't really have like good like it has air flow but you can't really make clouds and you don't feel like you take a nice hit out of it so I'm just like maybe just something with the cartridges that maybe they're just a little they're just a little delicate you know kind of made this flavor does taste really good though the King Louie I had this before the King Louie og hell yeah [ __ ] like it kind of has like an OG taste to it I mean its own g-get also supposed to taste I go dude but you can kind of you could taste say you know like I said before I've talked about this before King Penn was one of those brands and I first started when I started buying cartridges and [ __ ] days ago so it's always nice to go back to the roots you know and that's what I was talking about in the last year too like I was just saying that come pretty much like it's always nice going back to the roots you know I wanted I actually the review of brass knuckle cartridge just because brass knuckles was one of the first cartridges that I've ever you know smoked before so that's for sure has to be here on the channel but I don't see those allow anymore like right now it's all it's literally select and raw garden selecting wrong our name but rock garden is my all-time favorite everybody and the select is pretty nice too that she gets me baked um but check this out you guys so it's kingpin it's the world's most awarded cannabis vape is this still up to date is this still the most important in 2019 let me know in the comments down below the alien labs is also my favorite when it comes to like some sauce diamonds ooh ooh shout-out look the lights are matching the shirts kind of matching huh let me know in the comments down below if you guys have ever tried kingpin and if you guys have any issues with kingpin cuz I've had one one issue with kingpin before don't get me wrong the taste is great you know the flavors are great to have a bunch of flavors you know I got I mean every time I hit this [ __ ] I get pretty late you guys said clearly see you have to like my second or third drag I got [ __ ] lit but again last time my previous purchase was a Cali oh and that one had too much air flow like it had good airflow but it wasn't really burning like this one is burning you know so I didn't get me like it got me lit but it gave me super lit you know it tasted it did taste good though but we're gonna find out I'm gonna have to remake another video and um see exactly if it doesn't because if you guys can see it right here look let's see right here I didn't show you guys a cartridge yeah there you got the cartridge this one for some reason this one doesn't focus that much like either tell it clear or who knows but you guys see towards the bottom of it it's like okay towards the top it's a little bit more yellow than the bottom because in the bottom it's like really tight down there you know so not a lot of like I'm not a lot of the liquid is going down there so you guys he usually right here in these areas right here it gets stuck I feel like some of the liquid gets stuck so when you finish the cartridge it's like literally like you feel like there's like a layer that just won't be smoked no matter how many times you hit it it just won't burn because last time when I got one of these this was a while ago this is maybe like a year ago when I got it I got myself a king actually no it was the first king no that was probably maybe like maybe like three months ago three four months ago we had a king pen cartridges are the same half gram in it we got it all the way to the bottom right and they were just like a thick nice little layer and I'm like okay cool it still has a lot started hitting it and I was like dude it takes burnt and I looked at it and I was like dude that layer is just stuck right there it's not going in and it's not going in the coils you know so I was like what the hell I was like I hope it's just maybe like a the thinnest little leftover layer like [ __ ] I don't mind but it looked pretty big it looked like almost like 1/3 so I'm like dude in any other cartridge that's gonna fall all the way to the bottom and it's gonna get soaked up into the coils and it's gonna give you a hit you know is that I know a lot of people you guys I'm pretty sure you guys know how this works right there's like little coils that heat up inside this so this kind of every time you take a hit it burns the it burns the liquid that's in there already and then it leave it kind of you can see like it dries off the cotton or dries off the coil and then this liquid goes in there it gets soaked up and it's like you know it's the circle of life until it's gone but if you guys hello if you guys are enjoying these cartridge videos make sure you guys go

comments you know from the east coast from Europe and I'm just like brah what the [ __ ] I got I had a couple people from like Philly Canada oh I'm just naming all types of [ __ ] places but this is like connecting it's like a video to the world so that's stuff that's [ __ ] sick bro I didn't know it like our first one I started their selves like okay maybe I'm gonna get people from Cali watching my stuff then people started dropping from other places like what damn and again everybody these are just podcasts they're literally just like a podcast or just kind of the spheres in shape because we're kicking back you know we're keeping this pretty much raw you know you know what's funny I'm hella way I'm just looking here this is YouTube recommend you guys like the weirdest videos cuz lately I've been watching a bunch of fire ants versus bird-eating tarantula and I'm like what the [ __ ] like I've seen I follow this channel called ants Canada or something like that he shows like his ant colonies and I'm like oh [ __ ] that I guess how the hell did I get like how am i watching is and then a while back I was watching videos about like spiders and tarantulas and all that stuff and I'm like dude what the hell YouTube recommends me the most weirdest [ __ ] ever yeah what to get it is it flashes on fire every cartridge that I get I gotta I always make sure that it's like someone good cuz I know you guys seen a couple cartridges on these channels like for example old pals or the which one of the Humboldt forms I think yeah that was like the strawberry straw man has something like that um I looked at like more of like the the details of the cartridge you know the information the stuff that's in the cartridge you know I try to do my research on that but I looked at the details and you know unlike the stuff that's in there and I'm just like okay this is kind of clean this is pretty uh this is pretty safe to smoke and it's fire you know it's probably a good review you know is that's why you know this is like more like this is like an educational Channel so I gotta I want to make sure that I even I review even like the low key brands you know the brands that people don't really like I feel like eases like right here I don't know do you guys what kind of delivery services do you guys have so the final verdict I like the flavor and the design of it's pretty cool it got me pretty loaded and taste it tasted good but those I was pretty cool it's just that one thing the airflow this one had great this one had great airflow like I could make clouds the other one the callee oh that [ __ ] did not have good like it had good airflow and it felt the same but it just was not making clouds so I don't know what's wrong with that I was gonna get a full gram but they didn't have full grams so I was just like [ __ ] I'm gonna just get two so hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure hands up like a comment subscribe click that Bell you guys gonna find it so you

the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "T49_ZG_zc9I": "hello ladies and gentlemen i'm here coming with a thc delta eight vape pen review as you see i have it here i'll be doing an unpackaging tool just so you guys can get a real look at it and again this is thc delta 8 vape pen right here um if you guys are not aware yet uh delta 8 thc is actually legal federally you can get this at most smoke shops most gas stations a lot of corner stores um and you guys ask how is thc being legally sold so here's the deal there's delta 8 thc and there's delta 9 thc now delta 9 thc is the chassis that gets you extremely high and which is what is found in all of your marijuana and regular flour whatever you care to call it um so delta nine and thc a are the main psychoactive ingredients in marijuana and those ones are still illegal so you can't get any cartridges or vape pens that are just regular thc delta 9 or taca the main two active ingredients in marijuana that gets you high as [ __ ] basically excuse my french um so right here i have a delta eight one now the main difference is delta eight is missing a few atomic bonds is what they like to call it which makes it legal um it is a little bit less psychoactive but it still gives you a nice high and it's not cbd this is delta 8 thc this is not cbd but this does have some cbd in it and as you see here i have the treetop hem company it's a 700 milligram vape pen delta eight and one actually one of my favorite strains right there blue dream i love me some blue dream and that's cool part about these things it's just like your regular thc it comes in different strains um and again this became legal in 2018 it got approved by the agriculture improvement act here and the company i have here is a treetop hemp company that sells the delta eight thc pins and as you see i'll let you guys examine the packaging and i'll do an unpackaging so you guys can get a real look at it and again here's you must be over 21 to order this product um they as you see they have a suggestion date when they use it by so basically i got a year with this and they even have their website here this is shopyourthcbd.com so as you see this company sells cbd also um and also here too you see like i said um this product is in compliance with the section 10113 of the 2018 farm bill and it contains less than 0.3 percent d9 thc like i said d9 is the active the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana this is not d9 thc this is d8 thc and as you see where it says contains is hemp derived d8 thc it also has your cbd in it which is great cbn and contains like again less than 0.3 percent of d9 thc um i'm not sure exactly what cbn is i'm assuming it's similar to cbd but it also has that in it i'm sure it's just your regular hemp and the ingredients here as you see are contains canniboids delta eight and is flavored using terpenes and the great part of it is uh here it's domesticated i live in new york but as you see this was made in california so it's a domesticated product to see what's product i think these are pretty dope i already smoked um a couple of these before and it definitely gives you a high like i said it's less psychoactive the high might not last as long but it definitely does give you a high delta hthc right here we have um and i'll do it on packaging just give me one second so we have it here they put in a nice little concealed plastic packaging too again this is the blue dream strain as you see it says it right on it looks like it has it on the the pen itself too which is pretty cool tree top hem company shout out to the treetop him company let me go ahead and just open up this uh plastic packaging too all right here you go so it basically looks like your regular vape pen but um there's no tobacco or nicotine inside this ladies and gentlemen this is delta 8 thc like i said this is legal federally so you can get this at most smoke shops corner stores or even gas stations here in the united states [ __ ] i don't know if i can go ahead and just uh hopefully it's already working so i'm go ahead and hit it see what it does oh yeah that's a nice smoke oh that's like extremely nice smoke got me coughing so like i said guys next time you go to the smoke shop or gas station or corner store see if they have delta 8 thc there's a variety of different companies that are making them um the research i did on this company they're actually pretty good pretty good quality there's no nicotine in this no tobacco and all the [ __ ] this is actually a pretty good one right here 700 milligrams so i'm already i already feel it feels good too so again guys this is delta 8 thc vape pen um they're legal here in the united states this is not delta 9 thc that's the main the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana and um it is not thc a which is other main active ingredient in marijuana that gets you high this is delta 8 thc which is basically scientifically just different by a few atomic bonds if i want to get rick and morty on you guys and that's the main difference is just the main difference is really just how it's made what it's made out of and um the us technically has not uh made this illegal thc the thc that made it legal is like i said delta 9 thc and thc a and this is delta 8 thc and it still gets you high um and like i stated before it doesn't get you as high as your regular thc and when i say regular chc i just mean delta 9 thc and thc a but uh it definitely does get you high and um you can get a variety of strains i got this from a smoke shop a good smoke shop here in my neighborhood i live in new york state so um they had a variety of streams they had like i said as you see here i got blue dream they even had girl scout cookies they had wedding cake they had a sour diesel they had a bunch of them so you can even get your favorite strain out of this shout out to the treetop him company again that hit i took earlier definitely uh definitely did uh feel nice so again guys delta 8 thc is legal here um the main difference between the illegal thc is just a few atomic bonds so next time you go to your local gas station or corner store or smoke shop act if they got delta delta 8 thc and try it out yourself guys um these things are good i know they just don't have them in these vape looking things they also have them in cartridges cartridges excuse me um i actually have a cartridge myself and you look at the cartridge most of the the delta eight cartridges it's a clear liquid in size which is unusual um when you usually buy just the regular thc delta nine uh cartridges you're usually some type of color to them but every time you get a delta eight cartridges uh it's a clear liquid which i find uh i don't know i don't think about it to be honest with you i don't know if that if it being clear makes it a better quality or whatever you want to uh call it but this vape pin right here delta eight vape pen definitely hits nicely so hey guys that's my review shout out to the treetop hem company again and um as you see their website right there shop your thc cbd.com and now you must be over 21 to purchase this product ladies and gentlemen and that hit i took earlier i'm already feeling high so this thing definitely does its job it's more than cbd don't get don't get this confused with cbd guys this is not cbd this is thc it does have cbd in it but it's predominantly thc delta eight so yeah you guys have any questions or concerns leave your comments i've been smoking these for probably about over a month now so i can't complain too much and that's a wrap stay blessed ladies and gentlemen and stay high", "Pm_MC3QLa10": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful [Music] what the [ __ ] is crooked that [ __ ] ben [ __ ] that i think this plug i mean [Music] i'm still recovering from those hits anyone ever heard of gg organics i have not no no that's a big cartridge wow when the phones are obviously happy to see it ff is active on here so i hope you know comment to let me know crossing my fingers that

it's the 10th um fake cartridge videos i'm going to show you something let me show you something [Music] all right put this over here we're going to end it right here but uh just hopefully you guys are subscribed because i will be unboxing these and doing videos for these but this is just a preview and obviously i don't need that much i will be taking some of them though but i might possibly be giving some away in the future uh but we got a pipe thing it's gonna be dope another battery oh wait this pipe is for uh cartridges and then this is another battery i think and i'm gonna see how that is you know what i'm saying make videos for all these so hopefully you're subscribed and i could possibly give one or two of these away because you know what i'm saying i can't but obviously i have to do a video on them first but possibly this one this two battery one just two cards your battery one this one seems like uh i don't have to clean much after using this end and then this one is an eight bowl pipe possibly gonna give this away to someone that i know personally because you know what i'm saying this is dope actually i might keep this because there's eight bowls in it just for the tenth video you know i decided to show you guys a little preview of what's to come these are you're not gonna see videos for on these probably in like a week or two plus because like i said i do have a lot of videos that are scheduled i do have plug and play videos that are coming out like i have a lot of videos coming out but it's a shame that i can only upload one per day to get the most reach out of possible but this one's a special day i'm gonna upload this uh on sunday but yeah hopefully you did enjoy this 10th one um possibly the last one of this series i do sorry i do have uh other videos to

you guys in the next one peace out [Music] you", "xhICd92Z8Xo": "guys this is Florida MJ 4:20 here I'm a medical patient in the state of Florida and today's video is about the pocket cartridge guess that's what you call it's a oil cartridge these are I'm not sure how long they've been out but they were having this great sale where you you just pay shipping and you get them for free and I love this thing okay this is my favorite I like these way better than sea cells they don't clog as much but there's a problem that I just discovered today take a close look and what you'll see is do you see that right there that blue do you see that blue speck up inside of there okay let's find some more there's a blue speck right inside of this hole it's getting sucked into the cartridge it's getting sucked into the ceramic wick let's see how many more we find here's one I don't know if I recorded that one is this one it's hard to keep this at the right angle and in the light that one looks clear here's an aspect right there you see it so at first I noticed I was getting some harsh hits and I was like what's up with my fake what's going on with it and then I looked I noticed these blue things and I'm like what in the world is that and then I realize it's from these gaskets they don't work I mean they're not they can't stand up to this so I've used C cells for like well over a year and I've never had this problem with them so this is a simple problem that you should be able to fix you know this company exactly what the parent company is hopefully you can see this but see look do you see that it's shredded just screwing this thing back together shreds the gaskets and it puts it into your vapor I've now ruined a whole tank almost half a tank but you know I've now ruined all of this stuff it's got plastic or whatever this is all up inside of my distillate now so I can't use this you see I don't want to smoke this blue plastic or whatever it is and let me see you I'm gonna it looks like it's just like I don't know it's disintegrating almost and this is just dispensary distillate this is legal dispensary distillate from true leaf okay this is not some kind of black market stuff that's you know all weird and eaten everything alive because of how crazy it is I mean so pocket man I was I was looking to go over to your cartridges 100% because I your design you have a better design and I'm not gonna say why until I do the review on these after hopefully you fixed them but you'd have a better design it doesn't clog as much so please fix this problem and if you got if you got a pocket cartridge out there right now I think you need to tape pay close attention to what you're vaping and make sure that you don't have a bunch of silicon rubber or what that stuff is clogging up your holes and it's not just clogging I mean it's going inside there see if we can get this see is inside the hole it's getting sucked in there when I first looked there were a bunch more around these holes that I don't see anymore because what happened was I went out to eat and I noticed this when we sat down and then as we're eating I completely forgot and I took a couple of Apes when we went out to the car and I probably sucked some up in there because there were a bunch more down the hood by these holes but what is that I count at five five little chunks of silicone come on there look in that hole that's what that's about to be vaped and this one I'm not sure what's in this hole it could be more it's probably more of the plastic but it looks obstructed and it has a little bubble stuck in it doesn't look like the other ones at all and see even this one has a bubble but it's clear this one on the other hand looks like it's got a chunk in it or something all right well thanks for watching and I hope they fix this problem because it's a good product otherwise have a good one", "WSCKGtAGJMc": "you know guys what's going on and she have a boy cam and we are back with another review first things first it's like for somnium so it's not gonna be - out of a video hopefully second thing second welcome back you know I'm saying so we're here with a timeless cart review I had a timeless car and a long time I think the only one I've ever had I actually did a review on I think was the only one I ever had a couple months ago so if you want to check that one out go for it pretty decent one I actually watched it to see how they were before this but somebody was watching commentator requested it and then something else wanted to see it too so I got them the same takes they got a deal going so I was like sure why not I think they come at like seventy two dollars for a full gram so pretty pricey but like I don't know 60 to 70 to 80 around there he's like the average price here in Phoenix so for a full gram that is yeah so I bought this with my med card all my shits on there and guard you know I got two of them the first one I got was I had a pic because they didn't have too many left I went that I went pretty late in the day but this first one is called pineapple Express and I didn't review this one because I already did a pineapple Express video trying to think of who was with what brand I can't remember but I don't really want to do the same screen so I was like yeah but it was a hybrid so I wasn't lying I didn't want to get some hybrid so we got a hybrid in there this one I'm not to lie to you guys not the baseband if I did a review on this one I mean it wasn't very potent to me but I don't know that could just be me the taste wasn't the best either but yeah real quick the first thing I ever one thing I did notice right now about these cards that hidden before is I don't know if you guys right off the bat what's different about these two cards are these boxes so it says a thousand milligrams this one doesn't that's weird but this one should be a full gram because it was a buy one get one anyway which on the same stuff so hopefully this is a fulcrum for whatever reason yeah it is right there on the bottom but that's weird not sure why it does that whatever whatever all right let's get right into this so this one right here never had this dream before that's probably I could have focused too well for you it's right there it's called white circle set indica um extremely hyped you guys are curious what the hell that thing is that is a birdcage I got really bored and I'm like what's something I can do so I bought a bird yeah let's start this stuff yeah so to open the box you just lift this up a little magnet piece you you gotta cut this like a sticker here if you know I'll see been cut by now probably not oh my got it hell yeah boys cool okay holy [ __ ] oh my goodness this is just a mess okay there we go so with the little ribcage we got it guys um so I remember this with the last one the one I just had obviously and then the one before you might get this late nice protected box for yours and it's man this card's not breaking and this thing that's for sure oh my goodness it is lodged in there all right so we gotta pull it out of the styrofoam thing here itself and it comes in this nice little and the way I started opening it comes in this nice little like Capitol Hill keep your see this one's all night weird this is just a weird card I don't know but um yeah cool little cap if you drop it you know very cool eh then you push down hmm that was weird because like was a centered right and still not centered now it's centered there you go so supposed to look like that nice and like crispy little box so it's really nice to keep your [ __ ] all nice and packed so let's go ahead and pops of that off beautiful beautiful nice like amber color to the the wax actually let's see I'm trying to like look at it through the light see yeah this looks really nice Ches um pretty dark oil but uh let's see compared to my last one I think this is a little bit darker than that one was but you know the darker the berry the sweeter the shit's or something like that I don't know it's something I got this charged you know a holdup yes the darker the berry the sweeter the juice the darker the penis the bigger it is I don't know something like that but got the booze pen just freshly charged you guys are now I love to get that freshly charged pan out here I do not have any hydration drinks or anything like that so this is gonna be a little fun she's I think she's waking up so if she makes any noise I really do apologize she's not too loud so hopefully she doesn't but whoo let's do in case we were chilling at 3.9 watts 9 watts not 9 volts so that's it guys so already off the bat this one this one tastes a lot better it's not like a great taste by any means like I think I've had better cards but is a very good one the closest thing I can relate it to honestly is the bomb sickle by vapin if you tried that I had that one a couple weeks ago and I did my other vape pen reviews I didn't do a read on it I should have I didn't want to put three or more out so I didn't but that that's exactly what this tastes like so if you've tried that and this one is just like that so if you like that than this one Ahri's really good off the first hit I do feel a little like like calm relaxed numbness to my body so that's pretty cool wrong box here see fit I can't find any like THC percentages or anything like that on the leafy website I think they say that most of the cards went about 85 percent so it's a little bit lower than like pay pens but it's still really good number it's really potent number most like live resins come at at like high 60s mid 70s so this is like a solid one for it distill it let's go ahead and die take it number two and see where we're feeling after that one so Cheers good yeah singham taste is the bomb Segel really good like honestly it's kind of getting me a pretty fast I'm definitely feeling it like it's getting in your arms and legs first it's kind of like this I don't know how to explain it it feels really good I'm like vitamin chilling pretty hard here I do like it the one thing I will say is I wish I had a [ __ ] drink man but yeah this is some nice [ __ ] guys see if I'll show you the WAGs here they're the pride not showing very well but super thick I'm slim thick you know I'm saying just how much you like your girl's thing you know oh no but yeah no bubble doesn't move the last one I had man it lasted me a couple days because I took it with some friends and stuff like that but I love full grams man they always feel like they last forever compared to a half gram and for obvious reasons but yeah I know I'm super excited chief on this one for a while well let me know what other brand you guys want to see in the comments if there's any other ones like you want to see moon rock like somebody asks if you want to see more life resin cards I can get some more life raisin you want to see more in house cards I don't mind other than that yeah I [ __ ] got a new piece for my rig so I can start to think dabs now it's got to get a butane torch and some wax which is pretty cheap because wax around here is like 20 bucks 25 bucks a gram usually if I wouldn't get ones all the time so yeah so we're gonna go do that and then we'll take a DAB or something like that at one point yeah hopefully pretty soon hopefully in the next three videos guys next three videos is gonna be tab I promise so with all that I say like the same things over and over ice very good let's do another juice No Oh some old water not water I think I swallowed smoke who well well as I'm dying guys I'm gonna end it there cuz I don't want to blast you guys so thank you guys for watching appreciate the support go ahead and like subscribe do whatever you want to do call it cool let me know what you guys want to see alright I hope we'll see you guys in the next one deuces", "IxckcK20ET8": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're gonna be doing some OpenCart surgery I'm just kidding we launched we've all been there a kit that is gonna take care of a problem that I know everybody who's in oil vaporizers has encountered which is your vaping your favorite cartridge and all of a sudden it stops working or you're vaping it down to where oil is no longer going into the orifice holes and you have a bunch of your valuable oil stuck at the bottom of the cartridge or your heater gives out or your disposable runs out of battery life but you have a cartridges no longer functioning which still has some of your precious oil CBD e-juice terpenes whatever and you want to try to excavate them so what honey stick did it was we made it really easy for you by launching our oil recovery kit which is everything that you need to help get a non-functioning cartridge that still has valuable oil in it out of the kit in today's episode we're gonna briefly run through the contents of this kit and how to use it to excavate oil out of your cartridge now just to backtrack a little bit the way that that we got this idea is actually one of our authorized distributors and my buddy Darrell over a rich mountain distribution he sent me a picture which I'm gonna make the video guy find and put up here on the YouTube screen as it said modern-day roaches and it showed a bunch of vape cartridges that are you know like quarter full or half full and not working laying around like you know people would have these Roach jars of these little collections of people have these little graveyards of non-working cartridges and vape accessories with oil left and so I was like man I showed that a couple of our employees just to get a laugh out of it and they were like oh I have one of those I have one of those I was like wow you know everybody must have one of those so let's make something to try to bring those non-working vape devices or the valuable contents in them back to life hence our oil recovery kit and let's make it affordable and easy to use so oil recovery kit available on WWE stay calm is gonna be selling for under ten bucks if you use the promo code that I'll give you guys at the end of the video you get an extra couple bucks off so let's jump right into what the kids contents are and how we generally use it so just to come this real simple plastic container which a lot of stores that because we whole sale and distribute a lot can have them just hanging in the stores so they have a little hanger here you're gonna get your kit you're gonna have your contents of the kit on the back let's get a little close-up so two filling syringes four blunt tips two syringe caps and some VG PG solution so let's go ahead and jump right in you just gonna open your kit and it's gonna slide right out you're gonna have a nice tray to keep all your stuff organized in and you're gonna have a really nice large instruction card here that basically explains very simply how to use this kit but we're gonna go through all this in the video so let's even though I briefly ran off the contents let's go through what we have here so you have two syringes these are two medical grade plastic syringes that you can use and this is used for excavating or rejecting your oils now these syringes they have a thread on them right in here which you will screw your your syringe blunt tip the into nice and firmly to pull pull the oil out or to re-inject the oil and when you're not using it if you have any oils in them you're gonna have these syringe caps right here which you're going to be able to use to seal up your syringe to make sure that you have no leaking all right so let's go through what type of blunt tips we have and what really they're used for on this side over here you have different you have different lengths of syringe needles because you're gonna have different cartridges and different devices where you might have to get down either deeper into the device or you might need a skinnier device to work with because certain cartridges for example they have a center post which doesn't give you that much space along the edges so you might need a skinnier needle to fit down in there or with certain cartridges you might have a thicker oil that you need a wider gauge needle just so that you can draw it out so here we have our thinnest gage oil and I'm going to use this just to kind of pry out here you have a very thin gauge needle let's get a close-up of that this is like a teal green color in our kit very thin it's about a about an inch in length the the shaft here is about an inch and a half and then no it's about an inch and it has a very thin opening you're not going to want to use this for any oils that are really thick you would mainly want to use this for thinner terpenes or for very thin oils or for CBDs or even for a liquid if you have it trapped in a cartridge don't use this for thicker oils and you might also be forced to use this if you have a very thin area between a cartridge and a center post to excavate your oils so this is a needle used for those devices now if we come down here to the gray needle blunt needle tip you'll notice it is slightly wider but the shaft here is only about half an inch now what you would use this for is you'd use this for slightly thicker oils or CBDs cartridges that aren't very deep because when you get down inside the cartridge the oil is more than likely to be trapped around the bottom so this would be more for larger tanks that have very open areas Torrey you can actually put the whole needle down in there to excavate your oil and this is also a good needle tip that is used for dispensing oil so once you've recovered your oil from being able to shoot it back into your cartridge because it's a very small it's a very agile you know you can you can point it down into places you don't have to worry about using something that is much longer that might be a little bit clumsy or when you're dispensing your oil so that's what you would use this needle for here it's a blunt needle tip so here we have four even thicker oils you have your kind of a kind of a Shrek green colored cartridge here or you know like a little Oscar the Grouch shade you have a thicker needle with a longer base this is gonna be for also for excavating out much thicker oils so the thickness and the needle you're gonna use for what type of thickness of material you're trying to draw out of your cartridge so make sure that you use the right and you know because if you have too thick of contents you use too thick of a needle it is just not going to draw out or it's gonna be very difficult so you have this needle is slightly thicker then if you come over here to the very far end you have a needle that's slightly thinner but longer so this is probably gonna be one your go-to stand that's why we showcase it because it's nice and long so you can get down inside cartridges it's not overly thick but the ring gauge of this needle is thick enough so it's gonna be all draw up a lot of the the thicker oils or sludgy oils now the other thing that we have that we explained here earlier is your needle covers they're gonna cover your syringes these don't cover the actual blunt needle tips but they will screw in once you've drawn oil out and you you're gonna store a syringe for later use you simply screw it in to the syringe and then it's sealed it makes a nice airtight you don't have to worry about leakage or anything like that you can put it up for storage now here we have some pg/vg solution now before my purists jumped into the comments section of this this video and start saying you don't want to mix out with your oils this is really only to be used in circumstances that you cannot draw the oil out that is too thick you cannot heat up the oils it's not it's not going to come out or there's just too little oil in there so what you would do is you would take some of this pg/vg which is available and you take it you put some into your cartridges close the cartridge up mix it around it'll give you something to draw out because if you're saving oil saving some oil and being able to vape it is better than being able to save no oil and vaping it so this is only really to be used in very difficult circumstances where you're not able to draw your oil or there's not as much oil in there to draw out it's really just you you add it in there you mix it around let it sit for a little bit and then you would go on with your excavation process so there's really for emergency situations where you would have something difficult to draw now let's go into what the procedure would be we're gonna do some much more specific videos of some of the customers if you guys can drop into the comments section below what cartridges you guys have had difficulty with so we can get the type of cartridge and make specific videos for how to excavate oil out of those cartridges that would be really helpful to us and we can make some really specific videos for other people who are having problems with and getting oil out of a specific cartridge how myself or James would go in there and go about maximizing the amount of oils you can salvage out of your cartridge that fail but I'm just gonna run through a real general kind of basic procedure of what you want to go through when you're looking at any cartridge to save some oil and as you guys comment we'll make some more specific videos and get them up here on the channel for you so first thing you want to do is you want to have your cartridge now I have these little styrofoam blocks in our shop because when we're buying a lot of cartridges that are made of glass it's really safe to ship them in these but what you want to do is you want to have a cartridge and you want to have it standing upright on a surface where you can get at it and perform a little bit of perform your excavation process without worrying about the cartridge falling over there falling out of your hand and breaking so these things are just really useful to have you can really easily just cut out a piece of foam or whatever use a small vise or something but you want to have your cartridge standing upright in on a stable area to where you can use both of your hands and not really worry about what you're gonna do this was actually a child lock cartridge so it's locked but you want to have it to where you can access it you can see it and you can use both hands to jump in and perform what you have to perform in there second of all most these oils especially colder temperatures a thicker before you start any excavation process you want to get your oil as viscous as possible you want you want that liquid to flow okay and be as thin as possible so you can pull it out easier so what I recommend is once you have it sitting there get a hairdryer and heat up the cartridge if you're in a warm climate state we're in Florida a lot of you guys are in sunny you know Southern California you can simply just walk outside and leave the cartridge outside for a few minutes and it'll it'll get really nice and thinned out take a hairdryer if you're gonna use a lighter make sure you don't put the lighter directly on the glass or plastic or whatever you're drawing it out of because you could compromise the cartridge you could you know burn it you can have it react with your oils you can melt a plastic one so if you're using a lighter or something be extremely cautious to hold it at a safe distance so you're only using the outside of the heat cone to get your cartridge warm you don't need to get hot you just need to get it warm and then once you're your contents in there they're about as thin as they can be then you're gonna go through and you're gonna select the appropriate tool that is gonna fit down in there but still be thick enough to draw out your liquids if I have a thicker oil that I'm using then I want to make sure that I'm using a nice as we mentioned before a nice wider gage syringe tip blunt needle tip which we're going with Shrek green and you want to make sure that it's gonna fit between the center post this one does fit however because this has an edge here I might want to use something a little bit thinner just so I can really get down into there this one is gonna work a little bit better now the thing is is because this come this specific cartridge comes in so close here I'm never gonna fully get everything that is around the orifice holes I'm if I kind of heat and then I tilt it and I come in at an angle so you're gonna have to play around with each specific cartridge certain other cartridges you're gonna be able to just jump right in there but it really depends on where the where where the base where how the base is how the center post is and how big of an opening you have to work with not each cartridge is gonna be the same you're gonna have to tinker and tamper around with them a little bit which is why I'm really encouraging you guys to drop into the video section brand names of cartridges you guys seem to be having problems with so we can do really cartridge specific videos but I've taken our performer tank for example which has a really open surface that you can get into so it's really not going to be picky as to which blunt needle tip you're gonna work down and get in there with okay and I've even had our sub-ohm which for example if you had a heat or go out and you're trying to pull your oils out I have it open here it's not gonna be picky you could basically fit the whole syringe in there so what you're gonna do is you're gonna select your proper cartridge make sure there's the needle plunger here that's what they call this a plunger it's completely pushed in okay then you could take this and you can make sure that's firmly screwed in there so it's locked in there then once you've made it down heat it up the cartridge you go down in there and you very slowly place the needle down to the bottom but you don't push it down to the bottom to where the needle cannot draw up the oils or get off air this works on air suction from you guys who aren't familiar with it and then you're gonna very slowly just draw up the oils don't reject them and draw them up so that when you're drawing it the oil doesn't get stuck here in the in the the syringe valve and the so as you draw it up the oil is gonna travel up here even if you see that you've pulled all the oils out give this an extra pull so you don't have any oils that are stuck inside the blunt needle tip because if you just take it out of the cartridge and you stop you stop withdrawing and you take this off you can have a significant amount of oil stuck in any portion of here so you want to make sure to keep drawing so the oil makes its way past the blunt needle tip as well as the base and makes its way into the syringe and once you've drawn it out take one of your syringe caps here with the kit take off your blunt needle tip you can drop this in the isopropyl alcohol right away to clean it if you do have some stuck in there then take whatever new cartridge you would be filling it in to use your other syringe [ __ ] it back a little bit screw it on and then push down and it will shoot the oil the air pressure will shoot the oil into whatever the little remaining oils into whatever cartridge you are placing it into so that's just a little tip there once you have this sealed you can store these syringes even though it says discard after use that is for safeties you don't want to be constantly you know mixing stuff but these are cleanable you do have to clean them after every use if you're gonna reuse them we will be selling extra bulk syringes on the website so you guys don't have to buy the whole kit at one shot we will be putting those up a little bit later but this should serve as a very useful kit for those of you who have experimented with cartridges or

I discovered a few months ago this is the second cartridge that I have bought the first one was a King Louie absolutely loved the flavor on it got every single last bit out of it there was no waste with this one it tasted so good this one that I recently purchased is the purple blue dream equally tasty equally tasty supposed to be a hybrid I kind of feel like it's more of a like an indica based hybrid I don't know if that's just me or if that's really the way it is but that's kind of I I like this for the afternoons for the evenings before bed anyways there the packaging is pretty interesting it's got a little bit of a mission statement on the inside a little bit of history the packaging is pretty cool I don't know you can't see much on the back because they put the THC info sticker on the back but it does give you the basic information it is manufactured by us CP which is also the manufacturer of the Oklahoma tonic which I absolutely adore this dust really good it's good for trying to relax it helps me relax it it actually affects you a little different than it edible does I don't know if it's because this is a liquid and the way your body processes that I don't know I just know it's good I have bought three of these now really good stuff but let's get back to the 1937 brand cartridges the cartridges are always completely full when I buy them there is no little gap like there is in some brands I've been smoking on this for a week and that is how much it's gone down I like the I'm sorry I like the packaging the mouthpiece is around only thing I don't like is there's never a mouthpiece guard I kind of want a garden like a little rubber thing that goes over the top of it but still a good a good a good design I guess this is magnetic this is the excess snap I really like it it fits in the palm of my hand it's kind of just straight if you ever you know just just discreet nobody can really see it except for maybe the mouthpiece and still yet it can be very discreet I love this thing because you can look in through there it protects I really like this because it protects but yet you can look through there and see exactly how much juice you know is left and there is nothing that makes me happier than looking in there and seeing it completely yellow I mean completely full one of the best feelings in the world so anyway skies it's about 4:20 in the afternoon so cheers cheers Cheers hmm he's taste really good they have a different taste to them something unique I'm not I'm not sure how to describe it other than it's a lovely flavor I have tried the helix brand I have tried the Arcadia brand and I have tried the Oklahoma pure brand so far 19:37 has them beat pretty good I mean the helix was good but they're not readily available in this area these are available they're affordable and I really like them the oil in them is clearly I mean it just it does not move and that's something I like I have seen them like the Arcadia brand and was I mean it was terrible it do this and it just instantly air bubbles and it was moving I don't like that I want it to be really thick it lets me know that it's not being cut of course you know the packaging kind of tells you a little bit about it it says the product is derived from THC distillate and cannabinoids or cannabis derived terpenes THC content is 85% terpene content is 5% it also says the product has been tested for can't a minute keep out of reach of children contains THC now say for kids or pet manufactured by us CP LLC and then on the back of course you've just got like I said the THC sticker that they put on everything here in Obama so yeah cheers guys so what's everybody doing for the 4th of July comment down below I love the fourth of July if you're still watching I

Alaska here at Jupiter research and on this week's episode I'm going to teach you how to take apart to C cell cartridges the first type of cartridge I'm gonna demonstrate for you is our glass cartridge the glass cartridge has a twist off or a threaded mouthpiece which is really easy to take off all you do is unthread the mouthpiece from the cartridge and there you have it we do not recommend refilling our glass cartridges or our plastic cartridges due to the fact that the refilling may compromise the integrity of the ceramic and therefore compromise the experience the flavor and the taste the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate for you is our ATP or a plastic cartridge the plastic cartridge comes with a press bit mouthpiece which is camp very evident and extremely difficult to remove removing the mouthpiece could result in damaging the cartridge the mouthpiece or result in a loss of oil I'm going to try to demonstrate this by taking a pair of channellock pliers and twisting in a counterclockwise motion you will notice that it is a very difficult process and you can hear the cartridge actually being damaged and there we go it's broken the next cartridge I'm going to demonstrate is actually a pod that fits into the uno and the dart device you will see that the pod is covered by the mouthpiece and in a way that the pod fits into the mouthpiece is flush and is press fit which basically gives you no way to remove it I know a lot of you had questions regarding the refilling of C cell cartridges and the removal of the mouthpieces in conclusion C cell cartridges are not designed to be refilled in the end acade compromise the flavor the taste the potency and overall paper ization experience if you have any further questions shoot us a DM or comment below thanks for watching", "NyP7r-0VY4U": "hell trevor here with write a leaf and today we're going to be tapping into a 510 cartridge for this review we've got phyto extracts fire stick 2.0 it's their pink kush dislip pen i'm really excited to try this out and see how it does y'all let's get into it we'll see on the other side when we're tapping off the little bit of info that's on here before we get into the full on urban scale see on the other side cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into fido extracts pink kush 510 cartridge so this sucker came in with a thc total of 79.1 percent it's got zero cbd in it and it was packaged on the 15th of may 2020 i'm just gonna start pulling it apart while we're chatting through the information so we've got the lift and co website pulled up with this information you guys so we'll uh run all that off before we tap into this beautiful looking car so we've got pink kush 510 cartridge pink kush is an indica dominant hybrid that much like it's close relative og kush delivers a sweet aroma accompanied by a distinct herbal taste these point five gram distillate cartridges are made from food grade all natural terpenes with zero fillers and additives it contains 75 to 85 thc and no cbd we use top of the line c cell cartridges that features a ceramic heating element when filled this heating element absorbs up to 0.15 milliliter of the 0.5 mil of oil contained in the cartridge this can lead to the appearance of a head space at the top of the cartridge each of our cartridges are auto filled by weight to ensure that you receive exactly 0.5 of oil with 100 accuracy we need to get that thc sticker off there so we'll throw that on the torch while we uh rattle off the oh they don't have any more information you guys so uh i'm going to stick this on the torch while we uh do the urban scale intro and then we'll tap into this cartridge y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh let's drop this sucker up when the end card slides in you guys are gonna hover over the logo in the corner click

trying out a couple different things and i just picked up about four new products so i've got quite a few videos to make so um first i want to start with dark star extract cartridge it's cured resin strain is blueberry wreck so i'll show you the packaging and then let's get into it [Music] hello alrighty so i should have cut the videos together so you got a good look at the packaging um let's get into it let's open it up standing right in front of the window and the lighting looks pretty decent making my eyes look beautiful all right so let's open this up this is dark star which is a line i believe by the producer northwest kind here's the cartridge itself they come in these little like cardstock containers that holds it in the container and pull that out you can pop that back on or let's take it off because i'm getting into the cartridge so here's the actual cartridge um this thing is looking very nice these cured resins always look really nice not too dark they have a couple dark ones but i don't buy them but most of the strains looking really good um this i believe let's see when this was made if i can figure that out um made 601 20. so yeah this is from the same batch they've had for a while but it's not looking too bad so um let's see yeah i think i can peel off the sticker i always do that just so you get a better look at the oil inside nice check that out has some really really nice looking cured resin bho so i'm going to pop it in my vessel that i got from the giveaway i'm going to take off the shield real quick so you can get a better look at what i'll be hitting i always have trouble when i take the shield the trouble when i take the shield off putting the cartridge in there we go so this ran me without tax because of medical 2250 um out the door program so let's try it out i have been doing a lot of distillate cards lately so kind of hyped to get into something a little more terpy it's very good i started doing this a lot more just well first because it's cheaper but also because i remember cured resonance stuff being harder to hit but this thing is so clear and clean like no resist well a little resistance like perfect amount though let me see if i can get some notes on the flavor blueberry wreck and by the way it's made by um the grow the grower was midnight fruitco um it's definitely a complex flavor that's always something right off the bat that i noticed with uh cured resin is it's a lot more complex than even live resins but especially obviously distillates i'm not getting a ton of like blueberry taste from it and try this again yeah i'm not getting a lot of blueberry i would say this is mostly just like mirror scene and cardiophiline um tasting something else i can't i think farnacin might be the other one that i'm tasting in there yeah i'm mostly getting i want to say pharmacy and mirror scene in there foreign to be like kind of fruity it's found in apples but it's also it makes up a lot of like blueberry strains and stuff so i'd say generally fruity and then a lot a lot more mirror scene i think the farnestine is kind of lower in there so um all in all though it's really really tasty of course you always hear me talking about like oh it's got a mirror scene or something like that and i talk down it sounds like i talk down on it but i really it's great stuff it's just that i kind of get bored because i'm so into hunting turks that that's the most common i think miracin's the most common terp out of any um so it kind of gets boring after a while so i look for more fruity ones or more i guess like rare terps um i learned an interesting thing that there is a terp called hashishin which is only found in hashish and it's generally used as a biomarker to detect if it's something came from hash and it's made from degradation of mirror scene through photo and or i believe photo oxidation a combination of light and oxygen but that's something that i don't know if i'd be able to find because it kind of comes from like badly treating the weed but i'd love to figure that one out i'd like to find some some hashishing extract around here or something that's where my beard looks white with this slate yeah i definitely got a lot of farnesing off that um i'm just thinking about it now actually blueberry wreck it might be like a blueberry strain which there's many i think there is one just called blueberry mixed with trainwreck because it does taste like train wrecks in my opinion um so i'd be in i'm gonna look that up after this uh video i'll find out i'll do like one more hit because there's not too much more left to say and i do want to try and get on some other videos because i got some interesting stuff i got two grams of buddies live resin got apricot glue and blueberry muffin as a matter of fact and then i got some full spectrum edible cannabis oil um the strain on that is mango kush crossed with strawberry guava but i've been getting into eating like concentrates de-carbing them and eating them in capsules and stuff like that and i used to not like edibles but that has really taken me by storm in the past week or so so i'll try out a proper edible experience hopefully i will get that whole video for you tonight and show you how i get it together and then also just what the effects i feel from it are give you a little more visual all right yeah so thanks for watching tune in to my um next videos i'm going to have out this i say this like every time but i know the video is a little less in production today but i'm going to try at least getting into the editing and figuring that out again with this video and then hopefully i'll have some more tonight so um all in all for the price these cards are solid i mean they're cheaper than most distillate cards they're like one of cheaper resin of any kind cards and really they blow me away every time so there's a reason i got into buying these for somewhat or so much first for a good month or two but probably gonna do that again especially now that i'm making videos for every strain i got i'll show you the package once more um simple packaging just paper and cardboard really but they include the grower info and stuff so that's really cool so thanks for watching like and subscribe and i hope you all have a great day", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "c4SZOLT_ccc": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real maddie smokes and today and today guys you know what i'm saying i i'm ready for this one guys man i'm ready for

day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in

so shout out to all you guys that were in there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "Wcx2GCs8YHA": "you know guys what's going on we are back with another review today's review is gonna be on select I could poke of gold or however the hell you say that first things first I just want to say if you are not over $18.00 fee here I'm sorry it's against the rules I don't know what they do but you know they can't so with that out of the way I want to say welcome back uh I wasn't postponing this video in any way whatsoever I literally this is this is the state of the cart as of last night so I uploaded that video the night I started using this and I'm gonna upload this the day I start using this so that's how long it took me to smoke that for comparison when I used to post videos on like the regular League on every other day or so my card videos I'd go through a half gram and about a day and then a full gram in about two to three if I was like really try and trying or if I was just having like a rough day or whatever I would puff through them [ __ ] I couldn't do that there's no way I would be able to do that this [ __ ] is a lot in this I don't know how little of a tolerance break two weeks is or how big of it tolerance break it is but that [ __ ] really stumped me so I think it was almost three weeks actually I'm not sure two to three weeks but I still have some in this I'll probably keep this around just to get one random time or whatever but that courts out it's old news today's card is gonna be a select card here I ripped off if you're wondering why it's missing I ripped off the sticker this is coming at ninety point five seven percent tha this is a sativa it was made on September 17 2019 so that's pretty cool here you go with your sweet-ass select carts your full grams they come with this cool little like in inter pamphlet hearing I'll try to let that focus if it will maybe nope select leaf flavors your medical marijuana enjoyment to a higher level wig with luxurious 13 infused cartridges Wow alright so obviously all saw a cool nice little kind of popped out no you don't gate so you just kind of pop it up there you go that's gone it's old news doesn't come with a little cap unfortunately all no big fan of the caps big fan of keeping [ __ ] clean that's just me you know I don't like dirty dirty anything um comes with a little bottom cap crazy I know your jupiter-c so standard whatever all that good [ __ ] the only thing I don't like so far as I have to fat ass Bobo's right there at the bottom because I think this was laying sideways the box and they just kind of sat there and said so hopefully a hopefully the ventas will pick up off that side we have the dr. zodiacs moon rock a moon rock a moon rock battery I have the other one charging back here but they don't think it wants to hold a charge for some reason so we're gonna kick it back with this bad boy are you go ahead and screw it on here this is gonna be the first high to date it's only let's see 9:01 a.m. I just woke up you know took care of my dogs I like my cats right here on the floor by the way this [ __ ] ah right here we got homie he doesn't want to be here up so we're gonna let it go uh yeah so this is a wake and bake session we're just chilling we got some good ass cold cold liquids here so you already know it's gonna be a nice time all right all right let's enjoy this chill Saturday you guys go cheers let me know if you're smoking anything down down there you all know you already know the deal just keep myself over and over again all right trigger okay yeah this is definitely no [ __ ] there's no flavor whatsoever when it comes to this except for it's just like cook so [ __ ] [ __ ] yep there it is hydration break yeah I know that's a very strong taste out [ __ ] I'm is very strong very good though I do like push sometimes not all the times it's it's like a hit or miss with me so this one's definitely a hit I like it I don't like it at the same time no I'll say that so that's something to look out the oil of this see if I can tell the difference looks to be pretty consistent with the last one color wise if you can kind of tell the Lighting's a little hard to pick up on the smaller one because there's not as much so we hold it this way baby so it's pretty much the same consistency it's just hard to tell because there's so little of this one same same color maybe maybe this one's got a little bit more of an amber ish tint looks like came straight at a Jurassic Park like there's a [ __ ] mosquito in this [ __ ] or some but these things these ones are both very thick oils like they they don't they don't move pretty easy they gotta be sat there like this one has been standing all night and there's still a still small divot right there that it's still trying to fill so select is definitely putting out some top ass [ __ ] some top [ __ ] you know I'm saying so I'm not recommending anything cuz you know I would never do that I would never recommend anybody but wait no you know they're alright let's do another one guys tooth slightly smaller one we're gonna take it slow here we're gonna just chill see what happens yeah yeah actually uh after the first head the the taste that weird weirder taste of you know the better just doesn't want to charge for somebody's and that's weird um the cliff tastes definitely like tones down throughout the next hit I'm sure it keeps going obviously he was get more acquainted to it but that first day it was really [ __ ] strong it was like hydration but but no that [ __ ] was [ __ ] that was like I was inhaling push just so whatever the [ __ ] you know right off the plan dude you know so [ __ ] it's already covered one of the little holes again it took it out of that hole so it kind of got close to that but that's alright that's right ah it's a nice Saturday Michael bite we might go do an adoption event I don't know it's full of eventful ideas Michael see little pump at the State Fair because why the [ __ ] not I probably won't I don't even like his music anyway how's y'all Saturday's going hope it's going good or whatever day it is cuz ya'll watching this pratically hope you all are having some good days Monday through Saturday Sunday so Roy's just a [ __ ] day I don't personally like Sunday's that's just me but I hope every other day the week's good for you let's do one more hit here and then we'll probably call it a good video there she was guys weird-ass cat but oh yeah yeah that one's gonna get me bro yes sir oh [ __ ] yep that's what poke [ __ ] wow that's [ __ ] good I'm pretty stoned right now guys I don't know if you can do you can definitely tell there's no way you can't but dude I'm just staring into my eyes or announce the loot oh I already got another video up and coming before did I say I dream right um I already got another video up and coming for the next one I'm gonna try to do it a little bit sooner I'll probably do it when this parts like a quarter way done or a quart away from being done or like halfway or somewhere in there that way you don't have to wait as long but I do have like I said another carton this is from a different brand it's from pure earth so there's a little camp for you guys so straight I've never even touched off any other brand either so that's pretty cool I didn't break snow snow capsule opening hey guys I am I am blasted here I will not lie um [ __ ] I don't know what else to say guys you know how you guys do it you know just let me know how to do it I'm always curious just like y'all care about me my channels inches so I care about y'all I'm doing pretty good I just got a tattoo um pretty hype about that it's on my leg I don't know how to show you guys if I did if I try to probably fall over trying to get up there but uh it was pretty cool that's pretty cool um sure yeah that's about it guys I think we just end it there I'm just rambling on it's nobody's even gonna be here at this point in the video anyway if you guys need battery by the pocket battery search PC Katy all in caps in Google by one of their batteries and use the code camp whoa that voice back use the code cam 20 off and y'all get 20% off gotta have that code but it's huge so you all want to use that go for this otherwise like subscribe comment I hope you guys comment I love seeing your guys feedback into it pretty awesome makes me keep doing this [ __ ] other than that that's a wrap I will see you guys in the next one deuces", "1fGvtdnW8oQ": "what is that YouTube family boy fastest here gonna be doing another cartridge movie to do today guys I really hope you guys are really doing good you know staying positive I know the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now so I really hope you guys have what you guys need and I'll be over soon guys but stay positive you know but today we have this wind Berry Farms I've been having this [ __ ] cartridge for like two weeks literally it's just sometimes I stash them away and I really forgot about this one but this was a blue dream I had I'd had this one before just a different string you know I had the strawberry lemonade I think these are distillate cartridges I think these people are from like Oregon this [ __ ] you can just talk about like your packaging you know and like I literally went on their Instagram page and they are from Morgan so that was the good guys but these were like two cartridges for 30 bucks so that especially going on these are like 80 percent THC they're not bad you know I had some of these before and they do get you high they distillate cartridges this still it's still fire don't get me wrong and I still [ __ ] with distillate even though like resin is a little better but it don't get me wrong I still love distillate but I still have this Moxie I've been smoking on there for like past week it's almost done I'm going to take a hit before I get in the cartridge smoke along with me guys Wow you guys ever see these batteries are there like four pots to that little thing they're pretty good batteries I had barely bought it I got tired of the [ __ ] battery I used sometimes so I just like getting me buddy but we have this wind Berry Farms this one's a sativa hybrid so like I said I had bought one for 30 bucks I have Graham and the guy was like you don't wanna get another one for a penny so I was like might as well you know it's like pretty much getting the cartridge for free and [ __ ] so I definitely had a cop you know but I literally had this like two weeks and though it comes in this little tube it's a blue dream I really really loves the TVs you know they get you going on to the day so we're not gonna screw this [ __ ] let me know what you guys up to it's it's Tuesday afternoons around three o'clock she got off work you know you got smoking up if you guys are smoke along with me go ahead and do so I literally forgot to dry hit this [ __ ] but let me show you guys up close hopefully you guys get a good view on there literally it's like has a nice little dent in it so half gram so we're gonna flip it over for you guys you guys like my new angle where I'm have the camera let me know if not I mean like I said because I have the a/c pumpin so I I thought I was gonna have like a was gonna have the camera shaking but I guess it doesn't so I'm going to try hit this time see if I get some flavors to be honest it tastes kind of fruity you don't really get like a actual taste to it so we're just gonna go in our screw this [ __ ] in BAM so it's just ready guys if you guys are smoking let me go ahead and do so cheers guys Wow she tastes really good guys um tastes piney I don't really taste like a Blue Dream it smells like a little piney tation know them don't get me wrong she's fired alright so we're going to hit it again my bad got a little distracted so well tastes really good you know it does have a little hint of some blue dream in it it tastes really good you know but I [ __ ] hate buying half game cartridges they honestly they don't last for [ __ ] I think they waste a little bit more faster I don't know but half grams will last me like two days max you know depending on what the [ __ ] I'm doing but the high on these are really good you know for some distillate the THC percent is like 80% so it's pretty high I'm glad to take another hit and I'm cut the Vita short got some [ __ ] to do got got a lot of store get some stubs and cheers guys try and get a little bigger here for you guys no I have feeling a little good buzz you know it's not a strong buzz because it's not like an indica or like a hybrid it's just a tema but it's a really really good buzz you know really left the TVs that get you going on through the day and [ __ ] but you guys don't forget to subscribe and let me know what kind of videos you guys would be interested in but she already has a [ __ ] date and it only took like maybe four big ribs but she's gonna be gone maybe by tonight or tomorrow but I really hope you guys are having a really good day don't forget to watch my other videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys peace", "SC_UmolCLEM": "sup guys so no we got some battery that I got a B D C this is really don't from Blue River with collabo with a VT so yeah this is a battery that comes like this it's cool come with low temp high temp and then you can also well also you have to it comes with a little magnet the magnet is great onto your bottom of your cartridge like this so there you go and well this is actually some moxie life resin full-spectrum Yogo yellow oh gee yeah I doubt you can see it but who knows so you just place it in this battery badass something you just hit it it vibrates when you eat it big clouds in that's on low temp I don't use high temp because I don't want to miss up my cartridge as in make it too hot because I'd like to get all my chirping so I keep it low you know you can use a high heat but you start getting not a burnt taste but heavier taste and sometimes it's not so pleasant and I recommend low while these on your libraries and cards if you're using like a dissonant or anything like that you can use high because it doesn't really affect it that much so that's that this batteries dope you should actually get one yourself the Blue River you can get it on their website blue river calm extracts and they also have a lot of that good [ __ ] just to let you guys know they actually have cartridge but that's my other review that I'm gonna do right after so yeah", "_FlAIfuMlFE": "yo yo yo what's up YouTube so today's video guys something totally completely different for me I have not tried this product at all not even once and so I went out to my boys over at greenlit farms over here in La Puente area and they were kind of kind enough to hook me up and they were like here this is this is not their brand but they're like here try this out it's some fire go ahead and shoot a review on it and you know blah blah blah so yeah this part is in Greenland Farms if you guys do enjoy this want to get this product later on in this video if you're really okay that kind of catches my interest yes you go check them out I'm gonna go have them in the first comment down in the comments below and I'll have their weed maps on place with a bit link down there so go ahead and check them out yeah like I said though for today's video we got something completely different I've never tried this product before it but they they vouched for they were like yeah it's pretty fired and so I was like alright go ahead let me try this out so the brand that we're trying out today is gonna be called hollow points alright our hollow tips alright hollow tips so this this brand I really haven't done too much research into it like tell you the complete honest truth but from what he told me he said its fiery he told me what they using it and things like that so how's that are for sure I'll go ahead and give it a try the cool thing about this is when you little actual cartridge itself it actually looks like a hollow tip so let me see if you guys can go ahead and check that out that's pretty freakin neat and go ahead and look at the oil baby boy look at that oil is super duper clean no movement at all it's literally this oil reminds me of tree base clear for those people that have been around this channel for a while you guys know what I have review tree base clear before and tree base has literally one of the best cartridges in the game right now disel 8y is at least because they're freaking their [ __ ] the spider dude so went and then also when buying this hollow hollow tubes freakin cartridge it also has a proprietary battery that you could be using and they also sell it there at green green lit farm so you guys can get the whole package and they give you it's it's actually pretty safe do now that I'm looking at it it's a gold-plated battery so go ahead and take this off it has a little thing right there on the bottom too but I don't think that connects I'm gonna try that yeah that's definitely not gonna connect so I'm guessing you have to remove the bottom and then a little plug right there and then boom you got your 510 thread connector go ahead and connect it to the little magnetic piece down here boom slap it on and then you get to him this one is a full gram so that's pretty cool and honestly this is this thing is nice do you know that I'm actually looking it has like some type of like Versace what's an H but it looks kind of like some Versace logo type [ __ ] i'ma have to put it up on the I'm gonna probably gonna put the thumbnail up closer this so you guys keep the look out because this thing is freakin nice so we're gonna go ahead and try it out here if you guys are 18 and over 21 or let me know what you guys are cheating on you make sure you guys are medical patients legal patients please so cheers guys damn I think I might need it might need to have touch charges oh yeah to tree bases is you a holy smack so this flavor right here is called banana clip I forgot to show it I think it is banana clip indica and honestly right off of that and make sure hit it tastes exactly like Agent Orange not exactly but very very very similar to what to call the or Agent Orange from tree based clear and dude that when is my all-time favorite telling you guys to choose when it comes to taste treaty based kills it determine the taste and this is very very similar I'm not too sure how much these were running for because I didn't buy it but I'm pretty sure if you guys go to green lip farms and you guys aren't interested in trying this out on picture they can hook you guys up tell them some PG sent you so right here we got it on the Pocket vapor battery shout out to Pocket vapor I got my filly code link down in the description below go ahead and cop is better this is honestly one of my favorite batteries at the moment so yeah let's go ahead and rip this thing super fire dude it tastes like it tastes kind of like yeah look at that dude is hitting it I hit already two times fat hits and it's still not moving to do this thing is nice I'm not in your life yeah but it has a very very citrusy taste to it I don't really taste the banana in it but super super taste like really really tasty it's actually tastes really really citrusy and very very it doesn't really taste artificial it does taste like it tastes really clean it tastes really really clean I don't taste any ex show excess oil and you know and alpha the tip of the tongue and usually that's what a lot of distillate cartridges companies are doing that wrong in my opinion those are the cartridges that you don't want to be smoking on those men tasting like oil don't even get no freakin nice Terps in it and you know this thing is hitting all right so we're gonna take a couple more hits though and tell you guys the real full effects on this all right so I don't even know what let me see we shoulda shall I hit it on this is blue setting right here this one is the orange setting orange setting I don't even know they went out that so we're gonna hit it off the red saying we're gonna take a factually let's go back down to the orange setting because I don't I really don't want to kill myself orange right here let's get it whoo that was fat but it was so smooth yeah this is exactly like tree baits dude these guys are definitely and these guys are new to the game man for them to be able to produce something this clean and this clear it's it has a lot to say honesty man it just goes to show like companies who really put their time and effort into the product it really goes to show how clean it is and how I can turn out man when it's actually given the right time you know things like that so so how many times do we hit like three times I think we should hit it two more time to get the full effect usually five times for me does the job and then we're gonna go ahead and turn this one up to like a red setting and let's get it one more time boys bat hit whoo that one expanded the chest a little bit guys she actually hit me right there whoo now and give me the head change that one for sure gave me that definite head change like you know when you're hitting something and like it's like creeping up on you slowly and slowly and Ted after like the fourth hit you're just like oh [ __ ] like yeah attend me it's definitely a very very yeah it's definitely a head high without a doubt because the what I'm feeling right now is like I know indicas supposed to be more of a body hyper tell your truth that right now I'm getting more of a little head high I don't know if it's just because let you know once you and my opinion when you're first blasted you get a lot more on the head and then once you let it sink in more it goes to your body at least for me I don't know everyone's so different dude it's actually quite interesting how things affect people differently so we're take one more hit and give you guys the final rating [Music] super-clean headsman no the bubble is barely moving the oil is super thick and it tastes super fire the overall like the high though it's not too in-your-face so it's very subtle I feel like it's just it could just be me because I have a very high tolerance but yeah it's it's definitely hate it definitely hit me all over it I definitely I'm mellowed out I'm pretty sure if I keep hitting I'll get more mill it out but I'm not the type of person to keep you keep it going you know I feel like once I get that hate Union I'm pretty much cool so rating this overall product I it's a really clean product dude I like it I like that I like the distillate in here it's a very smooth very clear like very very chirpy very tasty too it's not bland it doesn't taste fake and the could the packaging honestly the packaging is something very very different dude I like it it kind of reminds me of like a brass knuckles I know that I know the owner that was giving it to me he said that it was kind of like it is kind of like an around the same branch area brass nervous but way cleaner and better version so these guys I can see I can see they're a little off friend of brass knuckles coming in here but a way much cleaner version like it does give off some hints of old brass knuckles flavors now that I think about it but overall it's pretty good I mean yeah the packaging is nice remind me a little Versace right here super super clean like in the thumbnail let me know what you guys think that thumbnail is gonna be the main picture of this so yeah that's the packaging and then the overall high honesty like I said the high is like it's a man it could be it could be better I'm pretty sure if I had a lower tolerance but it's it's like a six right now it's like a six you know you get it does something to you but it's not too in full effect but yeah man we're gonna keep hitting on this you guys are probably catch me hitting this on Instagram and go check that I'll go follow me on Instagram I'm gonna be doing a pocket vapor giveaway so yeah and then we're probably just getting in the video here guys so go ahead and go check out my Instagram go check out greenlit farms if you guys are in the La Puente area and of legal age and medical certification go ahead and do that and we'll catch you guys in the next video", "-HbPYGcOqRw": "all right you always get YouTube guys quick little video today man I'm not going to make this to lump I like 17 minutes its first day back well not first day back I got back yesterday from Georgia a little update today's Monday I got school right now I'm on my way to school not real quick and the as you guys can see if I tell the video man we're gonna be reviewing these new 20/20 future vapes like their cartridges but they've they call them VAP so I'm not sure why they do that so first off this is the packaging right here it's very very similar to every other packaging you know it's nothing new they do not have the lab test results on this so that's that's a negative right off the bat so this one is fruit punch Hawaiian Hawaii red so once you open it up it says your favorite vape right there open this sucker up let it go something fell out alright so alright it gives you a little plastic card unbox vape car attached to 510 thread battery to cartridge inhale 2 times so adjustable airflow ring and streamline metal tip design 20 20 V so this is the packaging right here 2020 vape it's not bad it's pretty good it's new definitely and on the packaging itself it says made with pure distillate cannabis oil 1 gram net weight lab tested certified but they don't have the lab test results nor do they have a website why you can get the lab test results so I'm guessing it's not really verified lab tested so let's pop this sucker out yeah it was pretty thick because it has some little small air bubbles right here and they're definitely not moving up so upside-down still not moving anything and let me give you guys a little close-up of it so alright here's a cartridge itself 2020 I'm not sure hopefully that's focused up enough but those are the little air flows on the bottom you can move them to all the way open or halfway close or all like obviously you don't want it all the way closed because then there's no air flow so 20:20 right there hi effect here's the oil real quick flip upside down for you guys it's a very very it's I mean it's pretty gold I'm not gonna say it's clear because it's definitely not clear clear but yeah nice little gold color not moving at all so cool so let's see take this little plastic piece off throw that away and if this is actually a really heavy cartridge dude like honestly this is a pretty heavy cartridge like this is this has to be one of the most heaviest cartridges I've had today it's probably because of the tip and then the adjustable ring on the bottom so I don't have any batteries charged so I'm just gonna have to you stick with the O's because this is the most charged so we're gonna do full air flow and then we're gonna be hitting this off of a three point five volts alright so fruit punch guys 20 24 18 over 21 and over you guys know that the old man make sure you guys let me know in the comments below what you guys are smoking on and yeah man let's get this week started - cheers guys [Music] that was a big hit nine your life whoa so right off the bat damn does she hot that she got me whoo right off the bat you get like a artificial definitely an artificial fruit punch so when you when it comes to fruity flavors like this I mean I would I don't expect anything other than like artificial flavors like I'm not gonna lie I just got it cuz it was the best one I didn't want an OG cuz I don't know I just wanted something flavorful to be smoking on you know I was smoking a lot of them like in Georgia I was smoking the West Coast cured tits and that one was really oh gee so I didn't really enjoy that one that much because I'm not really an OG smoker I like more like free things cookies things like that so oh wow that was that was hit dude all right so right off the bat the airflow on this is amazing I'm pretty faded I'm pretty high I mean right off the bat my eyes are starting to get a little bit low this is a indica so yeah it definitely has me [ __ ] I'm feeling nice right now and then the flavor like I said artificial fruit punch it's not too heavy it's very very subtle but you definitely do get taste it and we're gonna move it to the halfway point halfway airflow let's see how it hits a little bit better wow that is that is amazing I like the air flow that this is something a lot of cartridge company should do because I feel like most cartridges have way too much air flow you get a lot of spit spit back because of the air flow so being able to adjust your own air flow is pretty cool I'm gonna do this um 3/4 close so yep that's actually a lot better you turn the air on ma'am starts waiting for all this coffee oh yeah yeah oh you said yeah like five times but it's because I don't even know what it how to describe this so artificial flavoring the Terps the Terps are they're there but barely like if they barely added any terpenes it's very very subtle you don't get too much you get more of the fruit punch hit more than like overpowering the Terps so it's not that great I mean I would like it more I like a more cleaner cleaner whole you know like obviously I can't compare this to libraries and other things like that because they're not in the same category but yeah this distillate definitely isn't one of the best what I put in my top up definitely not and would I recommend this I mean here's the thing these costs pretty much the same as any other [ __ ] desolate cartridge how like what West Coast care Alpine freaking and it's in the same price point so you why not get the better product instead of getting this like I understand you know it's a newer on the market you know people want to see what the hype is about but it's definitely my final thoughts on this would be that it's definitely not worth it like yeah the adjustable airflow is cool we had the metal tip is cool you know it's a it's definitely a whole new design to me I've never seen a cartridge like this I've never seen a cartridge with this tip adjustable airflow you know and then distillate isn't bad the distillate isn't bad it's definitely there but I don't know it's just not a top quality cartridge for sure like but I'm just gonna enjoy it you know already bought it so whatever we're gonna take another pull out of this and then we're just gonna continue with some little talk and before I head out so cheers guys man that is amazing you're not amazing but you know being able to enjoy high in the morning is one of the most amazing things so yeah I'm gonna write this product the good six out of ten on the quality I mean the oil is what matters the most and the quality that oil isn't just isn't there you know it has some it has its goods it has it's bad but if that I feel like the Bad's overpower the good - definitely so 2020 you got I mean you're new to the game you know you definitely have done more than a lot of other distillate companies have done so you guys you know keep your head up keep working harder make a better oil product you know it comes with time you know everything comes with time so yeah 2020 future vape I don't know man cop it if you're a beginner don't copy if you have a high tolerance because this is definitely not gonna get you super high and yeah man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video because I don't even know what else to say guys so if you guys enjoyed the video like I said go leave a like comment subscribe and we'll catch you in the next video guys", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "WGYLG9X81pY": "this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 and over I do not user promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws of Prop 64 now sit back and enjoy the video what's good YouTube it's your boy savvy ji back at it with another fire video for you so first of all I'd like to thank all this recent supporters I've been getting lately man if you're new here man go ahead and smash that subscribe button right now man what are you doing that we produce some of the most fired content out right now and nothing less man nothing less so getting straight into it man getting straight into you know we don't like wasting no time out here man so for today's video man I got some of the craziest cartridges I've ever seen bro some of the craziest cartridge like the most eye appealing cartridges that you guys have ever seen I have ever seen anybody has ever seen man these cartridges are honestly like just by the eye appeal like I hope I hope I hope they're freaking good man I hope they're freaking good so for today's video guys we are going to be reviewing the hollow tips cartridges man this company is based out of California you guys can see right there man look look at this what did I tell you guys man this cartridge is crazy just look at the I appeal to it man like you doesn't don't tell me that doesn't make you want to smoke it right away man it looks like a bullet the distillate is super super clear and man look at it alright so right here we got the point 38 special which is a hybrid of full gram and right here we got the ak-47 hybrid all right so aside from the cartridges though I also have the matching batteries if you guys don't remember I did do I do do a review on one of these countries a long time ago so I have this old battery that they used to they used to sell but this is their new and improved battery I'm not sure if it's any different from this but it looks kind of the same but different packaging so let's go ahead and test these two out for you guys and I kind of want to show you guys the batteries just in case you guys do want to go in and cop one of these cartridges and you end up getting the battery so once you open it up you're gonna see open here right here I believe this is going to be the charger and the little magnetic pin connector and then nothing nothing too much in there and then right here itself is the nice-ass battery itself man it's all gold got the holotapes logo right there in the back and it got the hollow tips name right there engraved in the front man I'm telling you bro like if people see you oh and they got their their logo right there on top I don't even see them and I don't think this one has this one yeah you see this one does not have the logo right there on the top so that's that's something new that they added so and but yeah for the most part they do look like they're similar so like I said man these cartridges if someone sees you out in public your men are here with your homie smoking about yo what is that man like this thing is so I appealing man it catches your attention right away man so I'm gonna go ahead and smack both of these cartridges on there and I'll cut you guys in a little second but right here we got the point 38 special men and this right here you guys can see this little cap right here this is a collectible magnet that yes kink like you know I know there's a lot of people out there that buy cartridges of the same company and they're you know it's always cool collecting something it's always cool connecting something so like I said man the little metal connector you are gonna connect it right here at the bottom and show you guys just that twist on and I'll tell you do this thing but I just want to hit it bro I just want to hit it I just want to hit it because this thing is just like catching my eye man I can't stop looking at it so full gram politest point 38 special we're gonna do both of them in one video and then we're probably not to take some [ __ ] double hits for you guys man so Cheers if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you are any other deal holy [ __ ] whoa dude yo that was [ __ ] tasty holy dude like you're literally as soon as the first hit man that first hit that first initial hit you get all of the terpenes event all of the terms and then you know that super super leichter penis that you get from plants that are super [ __ ] fire hey guys so after that first hit man this thing had me coughing and honestly like all right initial thoughts initial thoughts I haven't had I didn't really remember what the taste was like but this thing is so flavorful man I'm talking about as soon as you take the first hit that exhale you taste all the Terps all the freakin cannabis like literally everything there's no fruity flavors no artificial [ __ ] this tastes honestly like some pretty freakin clean distally like I'm not even gonna lie that first hit got me already to like you could feel it instantly the head change happen instantly man it might be just cuz I haven't smoked today but honestly you guys know me I'm a heavy hitter so for it to be hitting that hard it has to say something so this is the point 38 special let me go ahead and take another hit of this and tell you guys what the flavor notes are of it on the inhale you get like the really really it's not fruity but it's kind of like on the sweeter side of the terpenes it's not like very very OD ish but on the exhale on this thing has me coughing guys on the exhale it tastes a very very smooth like if you're kind of like if you're hitting um a joint and you guys know when you hit a joint but you can at the at the exhale at the end you can kind of taste like your little small notes of the weed that's kind of what this is providing with you guys so when you and the inhale you get the terpenes and on the exhale you get those those notes of the freaking strain man I've never I'm never myself had the point 38 special and I kind of want to try that in but form because if it tastes it as good as this man we're in for a treat goes so moving on to number two right here we got the ak-47 this one right here is the one that I kind of wanted to try man because like ak-47 like that doesn't that kind of scare you a little bit man like what kind of they they have some pretty unique names man shoutout to hollow tips so like I said man right here we got another magnetic tip just throw that to the side if you want to collect it and then right here same thing you're gonna have to add the adapter luckily for you guys you know hollow tips to make sure it's a pride you guys with too because I know there's a lot of battery companies out there that only ever provide you with one ring so if you ever lose like oh I see you guys these things right here I cannot tell you how many I freaking lost already I've lost literally almost every single one that I've ever had to battery so for them to be able to provide to with you is kind of that a little come up man a little come up so like I said go ahead and screw this sucker on and as you guys know you guys a little design on this man because this is honestly one of the sickest cartridges I've ever seen so as you guys can see right there I this kinda reminds me of like a little Fendi logo I don't know if you guys can see that but inside of the cartridge next to the distillate it looks kind of like a Fanny logo by notes they're hollow tips logo and as you can see right here on the bottom they have hollow tips engrave they got the California weed sticker make sure they're compliant with everything y'all ready though lab clean tested all that good stuff man so let's go ahead and some this on the battery and take some rips man cheers guys oh I didn't even think I was getting ahead I didn't see the light or not fool my gosh one second oh my gosh that was gonna make me cough horrendously if I didn't catch myself well quick written because like literally oh my gosh about oh my gosh that hit that three second hit literally was so much freaking vapor and I it would it just filled up my lie my lungs right away man you felt the lung expansion you felt the turps you felt every single aspect of this penny just filled your freaking lungs up or at least my lungs up you know I'm over here talking for both of us but yeah man I think if I'm not mistaken their cartridges have like a special special element right here in the tip that's supposed to create a larger air flow and create milkier hits pretty much so that could be why we got some pretty good hits me where we've been getting some pretty good hits office all right like I said this is the ak-47 let me see if I can get some more hint to that because our see for me it was just more like kind of like a just straight up OG if Ike if I can tell you guys the truth yes sir damn like literally every single hit that I've taken meant is straight lung expansion guys and I'm not even joking like dramatically like after those four hits that I just took I am blown right now I am pretty freakin faded i feel the major head change already and i'm just chillin at this point i'm just chillin at this point right because these are the craziest card shoes I've ever tried man hold on I'm a hit on both that you guys see if we get some point 3d and ak-47 special man so I don't know what kind of bullets does an ak-47 take just a point thirty there is pazatto point 38 special like a like a bullet or is it a gun I don't know but let's go ahead and hit both of you guys some of the craziest cartridges that I have ever smoked in a while now I can't remember the last time that I've been so attracted to a cartridge like this so right here guys I'm gonna take two different hits man choose guys I apologize for that son and stop I know I'm probably gonna have to cut that out here's me brother what the heck it was so what happened after he caught me cuz I coughed I died literally I it took me literally two or three minutes right now to recuperate myself and get get back into the video I'm not gonna lie I am baked as balls right now these pens those two hits I just took right now to where the icing on top of the cake works this thing tastes so phenomenal like I'm talking about so phenomenal I have not had some cartridges this good in a minute man and it's good to see you know a fellow California company just coming up like this and man like I said man I'm gonna be putting all their information down in the description below if you guys want to check them out man if you're over the age of 18 and 21 you guys have to be legal you already know we don't promote that stuff out here so overall thoughts on me on these pens man I love them I love I'm like I say I love them sorry sorry strong choice of words guys I like them I like them honestly I have no complaint about it I have as of now I have no complaint like the initial thoughts I have no complaints about it I appreciate the aesthetic look that they give you I appreciate like the full grams the really the taste man that taste the taste is phenomenal the taste is phenomenal I'm not even a cat like I haven't tasted something like this I think the last time I tasted something like this was like me the first time I ever tried raw garden maybe the first time I ever tried our garden this [ __ ] blew me away in our sea for someone to be doing this with dissolute it's kind of mind-boggling man it's crazy how good distal is getting I know a lot of people aren't fans of distillate now that's 2020 you know there's so many other sauce and diamonds and blah blah blah but remember distillate it's it has its own purpose it has its own category for a reason man and they lived like hollow tips you guys are dominating the [ __ ] man I appreciate you guys um producing this very very well high quality product man so we're gonna take another hit though want to take another hit for that one time for the one time for you guys I am baked as heck though and I'm gonna end it out here man like I said the flavor for this it's not to overpower with like fake terpenes or it doesn't even taste fake at all it tastes very very artificial very real very tasty man like oh jeez like at least the at least the point 38 special was a very very og and then that a k47 also was a little bit more like it's a weird combination between like an OG like a I don't know what I want to say like an OG and kind of like a just some more earthy flavor you feel me so man I'm big like I said guys overall high quality product 10 out of 10 man let's go ahead and take this rip for you guys the crazies cartridges that I've ever tried Cheers aren't you just get me every single time oh those double hits are finito you take a double hit you're out man so just like I'm gonna be out right now so I'm adding out the video here if you guys enjoyed the damn video go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe it I won't check you guys on the next work", "NV58V74weB4": "hi guys so I see I looked everywhere online I looked everywhere on forms a YouTube how to take the snap on tips off the C cell carts right I can't see that but uh so yeah they don't twist off like a normal twist they just snap just take a pair of vise grips right close it down you want to make sure the vise grips are on the mouthpiece itself not the middle bracket right so then you want to take another pair of pliers if you're gonna reuse the automatic oil don't grab the threads could\u00edve - stripling so there's a grab brave bout here on the band's and there's a wiggle the vamp comes off that's how you do it simple as that", "eoTz1xs9-EA": "what's up everybody it's your boy heaven sit this is my smoking channel today's video i'm gonna be a session for you guys i'm gonna be opening up a brand new cart i didn't really uh have a morning session i kind of skipped all that [ __ ] i was just inside watching youtube videos type [ __ ] big chilling i don't even know what day it is probably on like a monday morning or some [ __ ] whatever day it is tuesday i don't pay attention to the days of the week i just pay attention to what i have to get done uh so the card that i'll be opening up today is a cheater juice cart cheater juice it's called tangy berry it's a one gram cart looks like a juice box just like all their other carts jeter juice carts i gotta crack the seal on the bottom and open it up let's set you guys right here so i can crack open the seal sheet she got one side of the seal broken now let's get the other side of the seal broke on the bottom all right crack both of the seals on the bottom now i gotta push this button on the side and slide the cart up see if it's easy all right it's easier to do my teeth so i'm just going to push the button i was a fail try again there we go so the car just slides out like this let's pop out the cart this is what the oil looks like looks pretty nice one gram pretty yellow amberish looking oil a little stopper on the bottom take the stopper off that's one thing that i dislike about these jeter juice carts i just popped the car out of the packaging i just took it out and already the cart is clogged and i had to unclog it by like sucking it in like um a lot of the other cards companies that i get like free cannabis company raw garden or like a moxie or something their cards aren't clogged um or heavy hitters card their cards wouldn't be clogged but um the jeter juice cards they clog really easily and they're clogged as soon as you open them up out of the box so that's something to uh keep in mind i have my um other cart i was finishing up earlier it's a free cannabis company froot loops cart so if you guys been watching the channel you know i've been smoking on that but i finished it up this morning so time to unscrew this this going into trash let's see can you guys see going in the trash bye bye and then now i'm going to screw on the new cart this is jeter juice tangy berry i've had this cart before but i just haven't uh put it on the channel when i did have it i didn't uh i wasn't uploading on youtube regularly uh or with any uh consistency when i did have this cart before so now that i did pick up the cart i wanted to go ahead and put it on the channel for you guys i hope i've uploaded um my thoughts on the jeter juice strawberry cheesecake card the jeter juice purple punch cart and the cheetah juice gelato cart so this is gonna be the tangy berry and i might pick up the super lemon haze next and there's one more i'm forgetting what it is but um i might pick that up as well oh the banana the banana og i've had it before but i haven't put it on the channel so it's another one that i have to pick up again for you guys but this is what the cart looks like the jeter juice tangy berry cart there we go focus it says jeter on the top like some red outlining i'm gonna go ahead and take a blinker of it let you guys know how it's hidden in the beginning first off um as i take some dry pulls i don't really taste too much i taste like a berry but like a faint berry nothing too strong one second you guys i'm gonna take a drink really quick that's the only um negative when it comes to uh holding my tripod in these videos uh i need to use my hands sometimes when it comes to doing certain things like screwing on the cart or taking a drink when i'm parched or whatever how the all right i put in my pocket i'm gonna go ahead and take a blinker let you guys know how it's hidden in the beginning cheers everybody and that was my first blinker of the day pretty tasty um i didn't look at what the thc percentage on this was let's go ahead and uh take a look really quick thc percentage is 82 percent so it's not too shabby i just came from smoking a cart that was 85 percent though so it's a three percent difference not too much the other card i was smoking was an indica cart this is a sativa so it should be leaving me feeling a little bit more energized [ __ ] water heater in the background where i put the cardigan back in my pocket okay i also have my geek vape ages x like always with my smok tiv16 tank sitting on top i'm gonna take some big pulls off of this right now the juice that i'm using is called grave apple by cloud nerds i like the juice that's why i use it it tastes like uh mostly grape with a little hint of apple but as far as the cart goes it's hitting really smooth for right now um it didn't really give me a sensation to cough i felt a little bit of a head change since it's a sativa i felt a little bit of the blood rushing in my head um i'll go ahead and take another blinker let you guys know how it's tasting and the potency as well cheers everybody uh so overall a really smooth cart um pretty potent as well it has a bit of a citrusy taste as well as a berry hint which is why i think they call it a tangy berry so the flavor profile would be a little bit of citrusy but with a berry as well um so as far from one through ten for the taste i give this card like a um i'll give it a eight if it was a little bit uh stronger it could be a nine and if it just blew me out of the water it would be a 10 but i give it a 8 for taste as far as for the um potency this is a pretty potent cart not too shabby distillate i'd like to see it um coming in a little bit higher towards the 90s but 83 is nothing to scoff at so um that's definitely for potency i'll give it um an eight as well um so overall for that card that's an eight out of ten not a bad card it'll definitely uh get me through the next couple of days and then uh we'll see if i want to take a tolerance break after that but um until next time you guys my name is heavenson this is my smoking channel if you guys enjoyed this video so far make sure and slap the like button down below if you guys have any comments or criticisms like always let me know in the comment section i'll make sure to respond to you guys as soon as i can uh but if you guys enjoyed the overall video make sure and subscribe to my

review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a new to us vape company and that is ocean cannabis co with their live resin uh today we are going to be reviewing their straw nana strain uh this is the one gram variety rocking 84 thc and 90 and a quarter percent uh total cannabinoids in there uh you usually see that big discrepancy in thc and tac uh when it is live resin because it has all those other cannabinoids that are usually lost in the process uh theoretically should be in here um so being a live resin cartridge uh it was on the more expensive end but cheaper uh than most live resin i've seen uh this one gram cartridge cost me i believe 63 dollars with tax in long beach california which again puts it on the uh more expensive end for a one gram cartridge but on the cheaper end for a one gram live resin cartridge uh so what are some other cool things about it well i really uh am kind of i was intrigued by their whole sort of marketing pitch and the reason they're called ocean cannabis co it seems like a pretty admirable goal to me uh they say on the back that they use all recycled materials in their packaging uh including plastic that has been pulled from the ocean uh so i looked at their website it's a husband and wife combo duo who are uh the head of ocean cannabis co uh and some percentage of the plastic that is in their packaging is pla comes from plastic that was uh extruded from the good old pacific ocean uh which is replete with plastic debris um i'm guessing you know it's probably not a whole lot of pla it's um hard to imagine it's made any kind of a dent but you know it's an admirable goal nonetheless uh so let's go ahead and get into it here this is standard 510 thread stuff so just your normal battery uh ah and here is that plastic that i was talking about that has uh some of it is uh ocean garbage which is again pretty neat i'd love to know the exact percentage the little press release i read online was pretty uh you know a little self-serving and smug but uh it's a cool again i do not want to dilute the coolness okay uh so we've got some different kind of child proofing here that i've not seen uh a line leaf with dot and push up okay so we're gonna line this leaf with these dots there's a little leaf there at the top it's kind of hard to see and it looks like it's lined with the dots and we're just gonna pull off perfect easy enough and there we are i found it curious that their website doesn't focus so much on the actual uh it focuses almost exclusively on their packaging and very little on the actual oil itself their their um their product they're trying to get you to consume uh but here it is and it does look fine that is some nice looking darker oil not as dark as some of the live resin i've seen out there but uh nice looking color nice consistency materials look pretty nice like that ceramic uh tip nice glass base and yeah looks like actually pretty decent materials all around let's get it on our battery here set the voltage at 3.3 ish and let's give it a try so here we go here is our first hit of our ocean cannabisco straw nana tasty it uh has those very strong nana e terpenes very sort of fruity and um uh yeah just a kind of a a sweeter tasting strain uh very delightful um i'm i don't necessarily doubt that this is live resin tastes like the strain there um i know live resin in terms of uh there have been some instances where companies have gotten in trouble recently for sort of deceptively labeling things uh live resin when they're not really uh that is a subject for a whole other video i don't know how to tell myself without having basically like a spectrometer um but uh i can tell you that this is still pretty quality oil uh whatever is in there and there's no reason to doubt you know they say it's live resin i'm sure it is okay well this is pretty quality oil and it's pretty strong i'm feeling it pretty uh pretty acutely after just a couple of hits there uh 84 thc so it is a high th c live resin which is nice taste is nice uh let me get another couple of hits in here i think this battery in particular has weaker draws than some i'm going to try turning up the voltage just a bit which don't necessarily do especially for live resin i'm not sure why but i've heard people say try to vape it on the lowest temperature uh you can but just to see if that'll help with the draws oh yeah there we go that helped quite a bit wow that is quite tasty quite potent let's get one more in here before we say goodbye for the moment yum wow ocean cannabis co uh this is a pretty good product i'm um more impressed than i thought i was gonna be uh i really you know i admire what they're trying to do with their packaging uh and the affordable price on this live resin especially for one that's as potent as it is uh makes this a pretty good value for a product um that uh you know the live regions usually come in that exuberant exuber oh i forgot how to say that word exorbitant exuberant no exorbitant [ __ ] i'm high [ __ ] 84 thc that right there guys is proof in the pudding the pretty the proof is in the pudding some kind of proof pudding situation it's all here uh big thumbs up from ocean cannabis co wasn't necessarily expecting the greatest things but uh really pleasantly surprised so far however like all of our wheats reviews we're going to review the whole thing all one gram here it'll probably take me about five days or so to get through it uh and once i do i'll come right back here and give you all of our wrap-up thoughts make sure that this straw nana is as fresh and tasty on the day we unpeeled it as the day we finished it that was never going to work but what will work is hopefully this for the next five days until then stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon goodbye hi guys welcome back to wheats it's been a little over four days since we started with ocean cannabis cos live resin straw nana this one gram cartridge you can see i've got a little bit of that live resin left in there not a whole lot it's actually hitting just fine i was just already out here at the ocean and i thought to myself what better time to finish our review uh our first half was really positive you guys remember i know i did really liked this stuff especially for the price and i also found their sort of recycling gimmick to work pretty well too or to uh to be um at least a a cool idea uh i'm not sure how it well it's sparing an execution but that idea of using ocean plastic as packaging is neat but the more important part is that the actual live resin is good stuff um and at that price i think it was what what did i say 55 something like that um not a bad price at all it might have been a little bit more for live resin which usually is like about 20 more or so than standard distillate so this is gonna be a big thumbs up for ocean cannabis co and their straw nana like uh pretty much everything there is to like about it um and i think maybe in the future we'll take another look at some of their products uh and then anytime guys we have one of these reviews that we like this much we like to give a little cherry on top dogs kicking up sand on my camera person as we speak how stoic is she any time we ever review that we like this much cherry on top i'm going to give you a perfectly perfectly paired cherry on top i don't know i hope i didn't mention this in the beginning the first half i might have if so that's okay because it's worth being brought

specifically plastic wars from this year 2020 frontline documentary uh that is about plastic and plastics in the ocean and uh this sort of uh unbelievable fraud that is recycling plastic and how

next time until then have an awesome day [Music]", "DKOD64GSTvE": "I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon shot - Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like

video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or medical marijuana my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so this video I got another car review for you guys I'm gonna be reviewing the same brand that I didn't like that the last to court review videos I think if you've seen him on Excel labs promo colors they just had a fire a steel so I picked up like I think six it yeah I picked up six cards in total so I still have two more flavors left of those to review so two flames I have left are tropical fruit and blueberry so I think in this video I'm gonna be smokin on the blueberry if you guys want to see a movie one in the tropical food and we're down below in the comments and I'll get that out yeah blueberry in this video so I'm not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below

"qmWGixwIe8I": "what's up welcome back to reviews on ABS today I want to make it short and simple nothing too spectacular going on but I've been working a lot on a farm so I don't really have the time to break out flour smoke it or bring out my rig heat it up torch it you know to all that 9 yards just to get a quick buzz so I've been sticking with a company called lifestyle farms and they're out of Oregon I'm in swimming our distillate cartridges premium with terpenes reintroduced into it here's a quick little view what comes in really good stuff it ranges out and it's really blotchy so I guarantee a total profile it's a full spectrum 83.8% THC in that it's live that's what they say so I haven't tried this kind I've tried the blueberry and a blueberry tastes really really good break this out there we go comes with a little plastic piece on the bottom you can smell it through there this is a granddaddy purple and it's the strain that I got if I didn't mention it already I'm so tired you can see it I got bags into my eyes so I can't usually I can smell it you can definitely just be really good with the terpenes on that one granddaddy purple strain that I got alright so I've got the Uzi pin just to test it out I'm going to put it all the way to the lowest voltage I can turn it all the way up to like 4.8 actually let's do 3.8 because I can turn all the way up to 420 we'll do that prime it real quick 1 2 3 pull through wow that tastes amazing that's he's just like I just like the smell of the taste of the button does that make sense so if you took the bud and you just smell it that's how it tastes through here this lit always freaking kills me so let's see if it puts me in the dirt this time oh yeah goods definitely that's a good hit it's definitely a granddaddy purple see if you can get a view on this purple full profile 83 THC CBD 78 full-spectrum 83.8% in the bottom over here it kind of explains oh sorry the side THC involvement my CBD total fro pile total I can't even speak right after that dab so total profile would be 83.8% yeah 150 milligrams per serving so that's with a five second draw and it blows your mind that's all I gotta say good stuff shoutout to lifestyle I made good stuff again didn't smoke in that buddies still I purchased at least over a quarter of it so far and its really good [ __ ] shout out somebody's to do great but catch you next time on review on dabs", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "JIRzJOaQmGM": "well guys i didn't make it to wherever i see it i was going i tried too much of the kosher tangy and it has like a weird it was different but it wasn't what i expected i didn't go to dinner that was a whole nother issue i said i'll go to taco bell the first one the fryer is not on they can't make no fried items thank you um i go to the second taco though just to talk about ksc i talk about parts clues the next thing he says is oh bro when i asked the chicken oh wow i don't have tenders and he said i had something else so what do you have because i'm trying to figure out like you just just greet me with i only have original pieces of chicken but i'm trying to understand why everybody's for our market and when i get to the restaurant pretty much we had to order our food to go [Music] right now like my head feels weird it's like it's some type of like relaxing i think but i'm gonna say it probably it's a strong because like uh it's just it's weird like i don't know how to describe the strands you guys like first it made me feel like through like the last time when i took too much of the rsi and it was just like oh my god my whole body works and now it's like kind of big but like my head still feels like something's going on in here now what this is really weird i don't know it tasted good it wasn't a bad place um oh and i ended up at mcdonald's out of all places and that was just not my number one spot and the wendy's i passed it because i really just wanted some fries but the wendy's line was in the parking lot coming out into the street and coming down the road i probably would still be somewhere down a robot if i was because this is definitely one of the strange that's okay i definitely feel like that oh if you got a headache i think was what i'm feeling as well i was having hey and i think it's like the relaxation i guess lately my pressure has been up as well so it might be lowering my pressure i don't know but it's like it's like this soft like massage it's like i don't know like a better word right here it's really weird [Music] there we go now i got a spot to eat and talk i'm blinding everybody i don't like to buy people sorry guys but yeah so to talk about it it's not a crazy um like cerebral high but it's like a definitely a deep muscle relaxant so i would say probably good for muscle spasms as well um i just questioned whether or not you could say this one will help with seizure activity i don't know sorry guys this is the technical side starting to get all medically when you guys i'm sorry i won't do it again but that's just where my mind is going oh yeah like muscle spasms um we have parkinson's also everything we have going on honestly um i feel like this would definitely be a full spectrum relaxing so you're trying to wind down after being so revved up i'm going to say kosher is number one where it's like it's almost like a definitely white understanding why it's a hybrid it's like the best of both worlds where if i get this like super sedated feeling but now like i'm starting to come up if that makes sense again with the cerebral massage um like i just i'm trying to see if i feel pain like i know earlier my muscles felt like really really really just every single time the muscles in my neck i got to feel like almost all of them if that's a thing i felt them um but yeah so i don't know what i'm gonna get to try crockett's talk because well i really imagine this man with a dog named or crockett and his dog you guys know what i'm trying to say um the other two are definitely in because so they're gonna be in two separate occasions um yeah i don't know what i thought i was going to do trying to into this and i don't even use them that often and honestly i can't say that often i just don't use them everything [Music] but i need to move lifting like i suffer from depression i'm sorry this is what it is like this weekend like despite me trying different things like i still go to these periods where i i don't have any like wish to do any harm to myself but it's just like the thought of living like why what's the purpose and it's just like you just feel empty inside and just go i understand that it's weird but cause i don't know that's why i'm starting this journey right it definitely gives you the munchies fries like my eyes are squinted they're not dry thank god um but it's like hard to lift and like open open my face is crunched up that's the crazy so this can turn into a mukbang i hear people talking as kids they're loud so you guys can hear another conversation with my conversation as well this is weird like it just feels like it was like if you stretch or like if you have muscle contracted when you let him go what it feels like to let it go if that makes sense um it's like it's just weird it's how do i say that i don't know you know how you were working out and i could be about content dating like once you get to the end of your workout imagine getting to the end of that muscle fatigue and then finally being able to relax that's what i'm feeling about that recovery period so this might be a good post workout as well so what i'm thinking how to use this is like a strenuous workout but definitely not before definitely after and then like do some type like like distorted yoga that i think would be the best use for this yeah i'ma go with that guys because what i'm feeling i have to generate a disc on my neck between four five and six um and the pain can be pretty irritating right now like if i wanted to do full neck rotations like i could so yeah this this one is good for muscle tension and fat food definitely at least for me and you can definitely do some restorative yoga i would say take probably two puffs because this is how it feels when you baked a lot two puffs would be perfect for like the store to yoga in the morning i'm just trying to think but i have any other uses for it maybe after a long day of work to get in the shower this will probably enhance the shower experience and then allow you to like melt into your bed and melt the sleep yeah i can see that like right now i'm just from visiting getting off the shower i'm getting ready for the bed and like just getting so bad and just like melbourne to fill up like yeah actually i'm imagining right now so i'm trying to eat my fries because i know these things get cold i'm glad i'm doing this research but i'm also pretty lonely something's wrong i'm hoping this journey will help me through i need to figure out when i became the way i am like you know how people say you had me [ __ ] up back there or past that turn and that turn i don't know what life event triggered this downward spiral that i'm in like i'm so even sure that i'm doing some things or revisiting some topics while medicated what i found about most all of the campus that i have tried is that it does allow those minds just constantly or allows you to slow down enough to catch your thoughts and like so like i was sorting through a few thoughts and i there were some issues in my marriage i was able to start to look at a little bit differently i'm doing the same thing from the concern years ago it's like it allows me to it allows me to take off my rose colored glasses that's funny because the screen is red um this is how often you think i think definitely for those who are suffering with ptsd depression and generalized anxiety disorders and there should be one to use before going into therapy and to talk because i think it allows you to really process questions that are being asked to you and dig deeper to find out what's going on so i think with all that to be said i think my final thoughts on kosher tangy is it is a indica dominant flower that is good for clearing your mind relaxing your body and for pain relief yeah it's almost weekend here guys i'm gonna finish my food and then make my way back to the house take my shower and get ready for work all right i'm going to sleep all right guys", "BMSHUp-OMew": "what up guys it's my clear three back here in another cartridge review I know it's been a minute but hey better better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "3L2JecFMHXE": "hey what's going on guys it's I stay grinding and I'm back here for another video for you guys alright guys so I'm gonna have my girlfriend in this video to help me out with this review now she never smoked weed like probably the last time that she ever smoked she probably took a hit like a couple months ago but she never smokes now I know this is a little bit off topic but I just wanted to show you guys in my new shoes that I got it's not first woman she does the other one got to just so you guys know I got I got both pairs but yeah this is my first pair of easy this is the new uh the new statics and yes these are legit um these are the most expensive shoes that I ever got let me know what you guys think of these in the in the comment section down below I think these look really dope I like how these transparent how the stripe transparent I don't know man these look freakin sick like just look at the stitching in these shoes man these are freaking dope and these are freaking comfortable guys alright guys now let's get started with the review now I've picked up a selective a bait rijckaert now this is the first time of I'm ever trying the brand select I've tried brass knuckles I've tried a lot of brands I tried a lot of different cards most of the cards honestly that I've done have been from the streets because cars are stupid expensive in the dispensary man super expensive like I only got a half gram cart and I'd only want to tell you guys how much I spend because I know she's gonna get mad yeah man this this this cost a pretty pain let me just say for a gram of this stuff and the dispensary is going for over a hundred bucks now this is a half gram now the guy in the dispensary told me that yeah he's some that he picks up from the streets as well but he told me that he really thinks that these are worth the price so I don't know the dude in the dispensary convinced me to pick this up and as you guys could see in the back right here um I don't think I could read that this has 0% CBD which is kind of kind of lame but it has zero 0.67% cbn but it has ninety one point 7 percent THC guys that's freakin high cuz I know most of the cards test around 80% I don't think I've ever seen a card testing at ninety one percent is the highest THC percentage card that they had in the that had in the shop now the packaging looks pretty nice looks really professional shout out to the met men in Las Vegas they are freaking dope a suspense are you very professional they have their shirts tucked in man like very friendly friendly dudes in there man they convince him the bodies expended a scart and there that's how friendly they are but yeah but let's open it up Oh see how is now she's gonna take a hit guys so I think she's gonna be she's gonna get pretty hot cuz I don't even know him the last time she smoked was was the last time you smoked it's because what happened with her she's in the smoke we have a baby and she didn't smoke during her whole pregnancy and after she was pregnant for nine months she had a c-section and I wanted her to what they tried to give her opiates and I want her to take those I children ought to take them but yeah I gave her a hundred you're supposed to they say four like a beginner or someone who doesn't really smoke they should take like 10 or 20 max 30 milligrams I gave her a 100 and she she tripped out like she had like a like a psychedelic experience type [ __ ] so here's the half gram select vape cartridge I'm also gonna let you guys know in a few days how long this lasted me because I'm gonna try to make this last because I spent a lot of money on this guy's that's most expensive car let me just say on the streets I can get a whole gram for cheap and then for a lot cheaper than what I paid for 1/2 gram of this but I'm very curious to uh to see how this how this tastes now on how high it gets me the tip looks pretty dope yeah the tip looks hella dope like I've never seen a tip like this I'm the dude told me that these are these are like hard to refill as well the guy in the dispensary told me that these are actually the number one carts in California and Oregon like he pretty much the when he said it that these are the pretty much the best cards on the market better than brass knuckles he was like yeah these are way better than brass knuckles yeah pretty much she was just making it seem like these are like the got it cards now I have my pen charging over there and let me just go grab it and I'll be back shout out to us I have another review of their of their wax pen review that the link will link to that will be in the but yeah they hooked me up with some bad news just so shout-out to lose their dope I like yous they're cheap and they're reliable that's that's that's the best thing about loose a lot a lot of the vape pens they break very easily but loses a good brand that you could trust alright so have the card on there let me just turn it on that's one five times all right cool another card is on you wouldn't try it first I'll let you try it first you just try it first yeah you just gotta press the button yeah bro that was cloud bro you saw that dude this smell is that was that was a little ass here but I was cloud bro like that's when he come over here come over here damn bro a little he doesn't smoke you guys better be high another one want some water babe what about it I'm gonna get her some Gator [Music] yeah I think that that concludes the review guys that's perfect I'll be even taking a hit but I've never she's hitting cars before and they've never even been that bad what do you think before I try this like what do you think of this it's make harsh on your dope if you haven't smoked what's more good rude alright let me try this now some missing I don't even know I had the yeah I had her temperature up pretty high though how did I like four point too much on mine down to three point eight all right guys Cheers no I'm just playing on my person girl 420 but he's dull damn bro straight-up tastes like you're [ __ ] taking a DAB out of them tastes like you're taking that dab bro just tastes like a dad dude damn dude that [ __ ] is kind of kind of harsh on your [ __ ] I want to come it actually is kinda hard roll - it tastes strong - I think she's more this is more like what just make her throw her like it's like it's like a instant hits me I think what is this a sativa oh yeah this is deficit even that I could just hit it knocked it just as pretty obviously kind of weird in red but this is a sativa man ninety one ninety one point seven percent THC guys damn just less than eight percent more and this would be a hundred percent yes Josh hurry shuttle - I've heard is that [ __ ] always fire deep like the flower always had with your I've heard is always fire so I mean I think the big question is you think this is worth more money compared to the other cards yeah I agree with the guy the guys look like I said the guy in the and the medical shop told me that he thinks that these are worth the money and I'll show you guys how much I paid up this cost $60 for a half grand I know guys it's crazy alright guys but thank you guys for watching this video please hit the like button down below if you guys enjoyed it at all please subscribe if you guys are not already peace only take it we cousin take it anyways you", "VthK8TnAf3s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] your was popping is your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "Qpt9-D4pYK0": "[Music] [Music]

theme Ohio cannabis live we're back with another video make sure you like subscribe and watch the end for a chance to win a free grinder what's up I should play mastered my aka Anthony here for hop cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're gonna be talking about a new product it has just come to the market I've been waiting all day to show you guys I haven't even opened it it's still staple in the bag isn't that something so we're doing a review from the bag okay this came from Burton creations in Columbus shout out to them and today we're gonna be talking about live resin syringes so a lot of people are familiar with these syringe products so I'm gonna read the information here but I'm gonna talk about why this is different from the ones you've already been buying in the program first of all let's go over the testing information here again this is a standard wellness product this is a live resin where is the other cartridges or the other surrenders you've been getting are just THC oil so the numbers here the testing here the TC is 550 milligrams and the CBD here's my favorite part is a hundred and twenty-five milligrams this is a distillate and this this particular product was created using a butane extraction process a lot of other dishes are created using a co2 extraction process a lot a lot of different people have different emotions about co2 extraction versus butane extraction so just so you understand and I'll put some more information on my website and everywhere else on the Ohio cannabis live page about these different extraction methods is that some extraction methods are better suited for some products than others so when it comes to making live resin part of the process involves you taking the cannabis and putting it into a freezer first and you do this to protect the plant from degrading typically when you take cannabis and you cure it in a normal method whether you cure it in a mason jar or you hang it up in a room let it dry and cure that way or in a barrel like some places do that is degrading the plant almost immediately so when you do live resin frozen live resin you freeze it first and then you put it into a butane extraction system - you couldn't use a co2 extraction simply because it just wouldn't work the the cannabis and the TCS and everything and terpenes everything with degrade faster so typically when dealing with live frozen resin it has to be a handle in a certainly different way than it would be if you were just making a co2 based distillate so a lot of people have concerns about butane extraction even myself I've had some concerns I have that opportunity to tour standard wellness and I have actually seen their butane extraction machine and I can tell you that it has a lot of safety measures involved with it utan extraction process also a lot of safety and it's you know it's relatively you know controlled environment that these things are done in and then there's also some testing and stuff done to make sure that the product is still safe so I can personally say that all the products that I've tried from all these growers including standard I feel that they're safe I haven't had any adverse actions person that doesn't mean that it can't happen to anybody so I'll just get that out there let's get that out of the way but you know with this syringe being in live resin like I say it's gonna be different than what you would be getting in a regular THC to still a syringe which as many of you who have been buying these since the program started obviously because you get more volume in the syringe than in the pen the pen is mostly half a round tins and with the syringe here we're getting a little bit close to a gram we're not we're not actually all the way to a gram we're at point zero we're 0.84 of a gram here so pretty close but we're not quite there yet part of the reason we're not getting to the grams because whenever they try to do a full gram it ends up being a higher potency and then what tends to happen is the state makes them take it instead of it being a one-day product that makes the product end up being a two-day product so I know many of you have wondered why these products are not coming to the fulgrim where every time they try to go fulgrim ends up being too strong for the states policy limit which you know it varies depending on what product it is there's a different potency limit for edibles there's different pulses little flower and there's different polti limit for these these concentrates and that usually caps around 69 70 % I do believe I could be wrong don't quote me on that but I'm pretty sure it's pretty close to 7% or less that these have to be at in order for them to be able to be approved and also like I said this stuff goes do additional testing that lets say flour doesn't necessarily go through it because the way it's processed in maize so they have to test it before they make the actual solution that distill it and then test it after they make it to steal it so it's kind of like testing it multiple times to make sure that everything guy you know everything is the way it's supposed to be I don't know exactly how much that cost but my understanding is it's a lot more expensive to get the concentrates tested than it is to get flour tested just because of the way the product is so let's go ahead and open this puppy up fresh as you can see it is sealed I have not opened it I don't know what I'm gonna see in here what colors don't look like I don't know so let's do this together one two three yeah we're open all right you've all seen but for those who haven't seen to open these bags you have to get your finger in between a little place here where there's like a little thumb thingy right here I'm pointing a finger and then you get your fingers in there and pull apart it's not too bad that's not the greatest thing all right so then here is the syringe whoa hey that looks really good now that looks like some go there that looks really really good I would say this is looking really really good so what I'd like to do is tell people that and this is something standard suggested this you want to kind of warm this cartridge up a little bit I'm sorry syringe up a little bit before you actually use it what I'm gonna be doing today is I'm going to be using my packs and I'm going to be using the oven that comes with the packs in order to do this review now just like I did with the RSO syringe if you saw that video what I like to do is I like to run mine under some hot water to get it lucid so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pause the video and I'm gonna go run this under some hot water for a few seconds and then I'll be back and we'll go ahead and load it in my packs and see exactly what it tastes like now by the way I didn't mention but this is actually the strain is called headband okay just to make sure I have covered that the strain name is headband so those that didn't catch that I'm sorry I couldn't see it the glare was because of the gold on the on the pack so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and pause this and go ahead and warm this up and I'll be right back alright I'm back so still looks the same - ie I recommend roughly 30 seconds of hot water you know and that's it just you know make sure you don't make sure the cap is still on it before you do it obviously you don't get water and your distill it that would be bad all right so I'm gonna go ahead and twist this off see it came off real easy you can see the fluid here now Ivan is empty okay and we're gonna go for small small amount you only need a dab folks so don't fill the oven up the oil should drop right in there and this in this oven is cold so there's no I like to do my cold so as you can see the distilling is in there and that is not a lot but that's enough for us to sample okay and then I put my I screw this back on there and it's clean all right so now you know I'm gonna go ahead and prep this up and I'm gonna go ahead and do my 30-second warm-up and like I said I think it's important to note that a lot of people do use these syringes to fill cartridges and that is something you can do and you still the process be saying you want to warm it up and then you would want to you definitely want to get one of those needles that didn't come with it little needle but there's a little new you can screw on the top of there to make it easier to get the oil into the syringe I mean into the cartridge I'm sorry and I think that that's something they might have to look at adding maybe a plastic one or something like that that will kind of make the refilling cartridge process easier but for me it's fine without it so now I'm a green light I'm going to go ahead and give it a taste hitman huh whoa yeah yeah let's do it water let's do doing the water folks is getting us get a water test going cuz this stuff's and tasting all right still in that same little bit the those guys are standard they doesn't did it again this is very smooth yeah I would say how am I feeling right now okay well when I sat down into this video I was in a lot of pain so I'm trying to assess how this is helping me for pain because that's what I got it for because I'm having pain where am I having pain that right now I'm having pain in my stomach where I had my hernia surgery and so I'm looking for relief for that specific issue at this point I'm not paying other funds to the disaster that is where I'm mainly having pain and I needed some relief so I'm going to pause this video for a second just to give it time to set in and then I'm gonna come right back and tell you how I'm feeling I'll be right back all right I'm back so it's been about 15 minutes or so and that lasted a lot longer than I thought let me check the oven here and see what's left it I hope she's my - ticked off my oven cuz could still be kind of hard you can see it's still smoking and well lo and behold look at that there is essentially nothing in there and kind of get a good angle and so it almost burned it completely clean I mean they say it was definitely a small dose but what can I tell you I tasted terpenes I'm not an expert on terpene so I can't tell you what terpenes I taste it but you know I think that that's something that we're gonna get you know some feedback on is that when they make these kind of products it will probably be a good idea to maybe get the terpenes either on the front kind of like what they do with another another cultivator or even to get the terpenes on the back so I think that that's certainly worth doing but really overall I'm feeling a little bit of relief I mean sometimes takes a little while for stuff to kick in but as far as my body and my mind I'm feeling relief from anxiety and stress and you know I'm definitely seeing some positive medicinal effects from this so I would say that this is a good product it tastes great it has a smooth taste if you saw my video I didn't call for choke at all and I took pretty good topes on that even after I pause the video and I continue to keep taking toks I still didn't have any really harsh hits my throat didn't burn so what I would say is the product is smooth smooth on the throat smooth on the lungs I did faith fit through packs with the convection heat so I can't really give a fair assessment a little be like in a pen with the coil heater but it's still similar is still heating oil vaporizing but in this situation like I said but packs it gradually heats the product and then you vaporize it verses with a pen it's pretty much one to man heat you know so it's like now so I think that that makes a difference you know if I hit a pin it sometimes can be a little harsh on my throat whereas if I hit the packs I can control the temperature a little bit more and I can turn the temperature down so I think that makes it useful so with that I'm gonna go ahead and wrap the video and say I think if you get you some had been live resin because it is different from the THC syringe you got before it's definitely gonna be tasty it's gonna be a little bit stronger and I think you're gonna feel the effects a little bit sooner than other products but again I think that you should definitely give it a try and should Boyd mastermind okay Anthony on how cameras live sign up see

[Music]", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys

the East Coast if you get on anywhere in a non Rex T you know illegal state they're fake if you get them in any state they're gonna be fake so I'll just do a review yeah so whoever did this you know spend a lot of effort and you know making it look pretty fancy and stuff but it's fake yeah I'm smoking although you know Durbin poison I believe try it yeah it tastes like poison like yeah that's pure like you put this into your body like it's just weird and awful like and what is that symbol like it's just dog like I'm even know why I'm doing this anymore just like all carts are fake I mean what is people will pay a [ __ ] ton of money for this the top doesn't even come seal with the [ __ ] but anyways I think I'll do tank next those are really popular fakes so I'll do a deck card next I

hawaiian haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery

weed welcome to wheats guys uh we are here with jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere

be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're

found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far

the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like really that's gonna be end of this clean carts video hopefully you did enjoy this one i believe this is number four or so let me know in the comments if you did enjoy it let me know if you want a part five and uh like i said like when you comment and leave likes it it motivates me to do more of these and like i said i'm gonna try and get this out today today is tuesday tuesdays i usually go live but i'm thinking that since i'm not going live anymore maybe just do reaction videos on tuesday and maybe on friday as well but or rest it just depends on my mood i guess that day but hopefully you did enjoy this video uh like i said let me know if you want to part five and i'll see you guys in the next one [Music] so", "kP15q815Saw": "All around the world, marijuana is being decriminalized, or even made legal. But is this really a good idea? In the online debate, the harmful sides are often downplayed. So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana. [Intro - Kurzgesagt] Argument number 1: In the last few decades, marijuana has been engineered\nto become much more potent. Today, marijuana is so potent, that it's actually a strong drug\nthat may cause psychosis. The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC, and there's strong evidence\nthat THC is related to psychosis regardless of other risk factors. Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD, that seems to counteract its effect. It's even being tested as a treatment\nagainst psychosis and anxiety. But because it doesn't make you high, growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades, while increasing THC levels. Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014, to nearly 12% in 2014, shifting the ratio of THC to CBD\nfrom 1:14 in 1995 to about 1:80 in 2014. It's unclear how precise those tests were, however. Overall, recent findings suggest\nthat the more marijuana you consume, and the stronger it is, the higher your risk of developing psychosis. But how high is the risk of psychosis\nfor the general population? A study from Britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly\nbetween 1996 and 2005, the number of schizophrenia cases \u2013 a type of psychosis \u2013 remain stable. The risk of marijuana induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with. For them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up\nthe development of their condition, rather than causing it,\nas far as we know right now. So the reasoning goes, if fewer people have access to marijuana, the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis. But actually, you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal, more people will end up with psychosis. Prohibition makes illegal drug stronger and more potent, because this way you can ship\nmore product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit. This is what happened during\nthe prohibition of alcohol in the US, where hard liquor became the norm. And the same is happening with marijuana now. Imagine a world where liquor\nis the only alcohol available. You have the choice of either not drinking at all, or getting much drunker than you would like to. This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today. People didn't stop drinking during prohibition, and the numbers show that laws\ndon't deter people from using marijuana. We can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer. If marijuana were legal, there would be more options for consumers, and regulators could, for example,\ninsist on a high level of CBD. Just like most people don't drink\nan after-work bottle of vodka, many people would gladly consume\nthe after-work beer version of marijuana. Argument 2:\nMarijuana is a gateway drug. If it's legalized, there will be a spike in the use\nof much more dangerous drugs. A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point. Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend: As more young people try legal marijuana, they might end up trying harder drugs. But it turns out that the real gateway\nto drug use comes much earlier: Cigarettes. One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs\nthan those who didn't. And a 2007 study found that teenagers\nbetween 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink, seven times more likely to have used\ndrugs like heroin or cocaine, and were also seven times more likely\nto resort to marijuana. But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal\nstop the use of hard drugs? At first, it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not. If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell. The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all? Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable\nto drugs and addiction. A difficult childhood, early trauma, low social status, depression, even genetic factors. Which drug they get addicted to\nis more often than not a matter of chance. Addicts take drugs to escape their problems. But drugs don't solve any of those problems, and instead become a new problem. But punishing people\nfor their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about\nthe underlying causes either. So some argue we need to\ntake a completely different route. In 2001, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. So it was desperate enough to try something radical: Possession and use of\nall illegal drugs was decriminalized. You would no longer be arrested; instead, authorities launched a major health campaign. People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services, and got help with treatment and harm reduction. Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime. The results were stunning: the number of people\nwho tried drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 28% by 2012. The use of hard drugs decreased, as well as HIV & hepatitis infections\nand overdoses. Making drugs legal might overall\nhelp society much more than it harms it. Argument number 3: Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy. It needs to remain illegal\nto keep harm at a minimum. While marijuana addiction is\nmore psychological than physical, it is still a real problem. The demand for treatment\nfor marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone. In total, about 10% of people\nwho try marijuana will become addicted. This is also related to higher THC levels. A study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana\nin Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years. For every 1% increase in THC, 60 more people enter treatment nationwide. In terms of negative health effects, some studies linked marijuana use to\nincreased blood pressure and lung problems, while a 2016 study found that\nmarijuana use was unrelated to physical health problems,\nexcept for a higher risk of gum disease. Some studies showed that\nmarijuana use alters teenagers brains, and decreases their intelligence; but when more recent studies\ntook drinking and smoking into account, the results were inconclusive. Overall, research shows that taking any drugs while the brain\nis still in development is bad for you. But the truth is, we don't know yet\nhow unhealthy marijuana is. We need more funding for research, which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal. We can put what we know into perspective though. 16% of people who consume alcohol\nbecome alcoholics, and 32% of people who try cigarettes\nbecome smokers. We know for sure alcohol affects your brain, destroys your liver and causes cancer; while tobacco clogs your arteries, destroys your lungs and also causes cancer. 3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year, while smoking kills more than 6 million people. Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol\nare harmless just because they're legal. Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely dangerous. Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people. It's often much harder to buy legal drugs\nfor teenagers than to buy illegal ones. Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids. Legality creates incentives here\nthat drug dealers can't exploit. So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it. It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses. It could also open the floodgates\nto tons of new research that shows us how harmful\nit really is, and to whom. Conclusion: Marijuana is a drug, and just like any other drug,\nIt has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it. It is not harmless. The best way to protect society\nfrom its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation.

going on Gus Reaper bees then coming to you today with a kind of a different type of video what I'm going to be doing is I got a fake TKO extract cards I guess as you can see by the title now my original plan was to make this video solely on how to spot the differences and real and fakes two issues with that though when there isn't really not that meaning things to look for it's from me research and like I kind of thought I was gonna be like ningke's a little bit where I could show you four or five different things that you know look forward to help you out but it's TKO it's pretty straightforward to the point I will leave a link to what Realty care cart looks like I am getting a real TKO card he's gonna take about seven days maybe ten to get here Lou tell me five but I will soon so the main thing you want to do is it needs to come in a box and will come in this box with the disposable battery I have a black tip but then like I said this isn't real I'm just saying it will have a black tip and if you're not getting that it the odds of it being real is very very very very slim because they started doing that I believe in May and I'm sure that your ear plugs telling you that he's got a hookup at the source and it's just this continued packaging but they're they're good I'm sure that's what he's telling you if you call him out on it but this is the issue that arises with this I'm trying to keep it pretty simple and not make this video over over complicated or over long but I believe these plugs believe they're plugs you know what I'm saying I believe the people that you your neighborhood plug you're getting these from their plugs by telling them hey I'm under straight from the source in Cali Colorado I know people straight from the company trust me these are hooked up bro they're legit and they probably believe it and it just gets to a point where it's like so many people is convoluted this card game bro it is crazy and it's fairly simple to even I mean I don't know man it's it's crazy out there guys but when it comes to this the price point to something you need to look for if you're getting a car for 20 bucks a pop if you get 10 or 30 bucks a pop if you get however many you get or hell even 40 and you can go to a website and say that those cards are $40 for like a half gram and 60 bucks for a gram 35 for a half gram 64 gram you think you're doing has that much of a connection that he can get you a gram of that same cart for Wax cart for 20 bucks right that's pretty crazy but people believe it and it's like so that's the two main things to look at for these TK is I'm going on a little tangent here but things that come in a box with the disposable pen battery and if you're not paying what it says on a website or a dispensary close to it it's not going to be real I mean but here's the thing this is fake but this is a good fake now there's fake real fakes and black markets this would be fake what I mean by fake is this is what people can buy these packaging online for cents or dollars depending on what brand they get they can fill it with their own oil and they will sell it to you and that's what I mean by fake I'm not counting these people that's putting fake things and to make you think you're getting THC when I say fake I mean I'm counting everything - guys I'm counting the dude that's out here in his garage mixing a half a gram of wax with some liquidiser and selling you some liquidy [ __ ] that's turning round and 15 hits in or it's burning out in 15 hits I'm counting that dude all the way up to these people with dispensaries that's making their own [ __ ] but no man in carts I'm counting from the very bottom of the totem pole up to the very top of the totem totem pole and that's what I mean by fake and that's what's so dangerous about these because you do not know what you're getting until you actually get them now you can do the oil check the oil under the old and then there's ways to trick you and deceive you but so for example this is the card I've been smoking it I have some good things to say about this car don't get me wrong I just want to talk about the fake aspects of everything and what you need to watch out for it so when it gets to the point that you're getting fake cards right you have to and again fake means that it's in a fake companies it's not really from the company someone bought the packaging I don't mean the product inside is fake um the oil is what you have to check for and like I said they can they can mess with that even a little bit to try to deceive you but this one even I've been smoking on this one constantly for 24 over 24 hours and I have smoked other cards so I'm not saying I just only smoke this one got smoke this one pretty heavily and it's hauling down that much now normally if it was not a real legit dispensary card I would be well on half my now so even though this is fake I didn't want to shut the dude out who made it even though I don't know him for saying this dude has some quality all I thought it was gonna be diluted I really did I thought it was gonna be diluted and I was a little upset about that but the chairs by the way no mutt the pool is not amazing it's good but it's not amazing it's like it gets clogged up a little bit I don't I'm not a fan of that but the taste on this guy's whoever tarp this up tarps it up good because I mean the wedding cake flavor is incredible the Sour Diesel is amazing too and but this that just because this one is good and I'm going to tell you guys I don't want to get too far into this and like I said I'm not promoting this I'm just giving you examples of what to look for if you're not 18 21 whatever it is please leave the channel but shares we'll talk about this a little bit because I'm going to tangent now this is like seven minutes and this is Tim long already I don't like the pull of it but the flavor is great the hog is great I mean [ __ ] like I say dumb dang exciting about five six it's these three whoever made these men I don't know who you are you'll never see this but I have to out of good consciousness say props to you bro if everybody that made that made their own all and put them in these carts did it the way you did it my friend we would have no issues but give me a second I'll be right back I want to show you something else boys now I never had an example really before of what those pesticide carts where boys I had them before in the past about thrown away and this was months ago my friend did recently give me an exotic that was all it was black element just showed on the channel but I don't even remember what the [ __ ] I did with it honestly I think I'll [ __ ] I don't know I don't know where it's at so I went out and got another one no I didn't pay for this this is one that my friend gave me he actually made this himself so this is the ones boys that you want to be careful of no and it's not that he really even did a horrible job in making this it's just that he didn't make her up you see how liquidy that is and you see how it's already changing colors and you use liquid wax liquid out there and this is that hot dog water boys it's not going to show up as bad as it actually is on cam I don't think I'm not even going to hit that but and as long as you keep in the card it's not gonna be harmful but now this is what I'm telling you about this is the [ __ ] so if everybody made made the card selected TKOs like I was showing you guys then it really wouldn't be a problem like that you know I'm saying but people make them like this - and it's I need to hit it to get that bubble going to really show you guys I'm not gonna hit it like I said that's just so I don't even know what I did with my decal court now so let's hit this one this is a this is a dank something voice so cheers someone in this video um I'm sorry it was all over the place I wanted to make it is kind of educational as possible on the on the TKO courts but like I said two main factors is and it's coming a box disposable battery and the pricing on it obviously and aside from that I'm we'll be back with some brass knuckles I can show you two guys how to spot brass knuckles I went on that real TKO court to show you guys I also got some other different brands of cards so I really want that familiar with that are coming in that's some reviews on those as well but also hey congrats to mr. and bling see for 1000 subs this one's for you buddy", "RBpsFKdqaHw": "I try to get to you know one or two shows a year like the American Jail Association or the American Corrections Association Jamie Mosley is a successful inventor who started a company and made a lot of money with an e-cigarette designed to be smoked in jails specifically his Jail how we doing on time you know 15 minutes Mosley is the jailer of Laurel County Kentucky he says he came up with his cigarette which he calls cross bar out of necessity when I developed the product it was really not with the intention of starting a company I was just trying to solve a problem with within my own facility Kentucky banned all tobacco products in jails in the mid-2000s over concerns about secondhand smoke it may have made inmates healthier but Mosley says it also made his life as a jailer a lot harder you know many of these inmates are coming in in a very intoxicated state whether that be from drugs heroin coming off of all of that and then without a cigarette at the same time sometimes can create very very volatile situations the idea for a jail specifically cigarette came quickly figuring out how to make one that inmates couldn't use as a weapon took a little longer one of our main objectives when we started was to be able to do this I mean everything out there had a metal casing or was a very very hard plastic casing that could be hammered down into a shank we've dressed that fairly easily but we also wanted something with a very low voltage so that you couldn't utilize it for an ignition source to start a fire with but we wanted something that was very you got to think of everything like that you do and that's the big advantage I guess that I have you know I live with 550 inmates every single day and I understand their behavior 986 today okay so you're gonna get the inmates ID make sure he is who he is give him his ID back next thing you want to go do is you're going to check and make sure this is the one I sold him last time I came around these men in Mosley's jail are part of a specialized drug rehabilitation program for them ethics are a useful crunch how'd you end up here well my drug addiction led me here cocaine charge and a theft charge and I've been here going on 90 days well you know their facilities where they did where they didn't have any e-cigarette option uh yes I've been another for sale these fake and has no way to go up sir down there so what's that like when you show up there and you have nothing oh it's nerve wracking this imagining won't for smoking two packs of cigarettes on the straight to nothing what what do you think when you got here found out they had this I was thought I was in Haven for a minute you know if you know Mosley's invention may help keep inmates happy but it's also a lucrative business cross bar is available in some 33 prisons and jails nationwide and the company is expected to do three and a half million dollars in sales this year you know there are also of course kind of a classically captive audience for your for your own product they're addicted yeah and they don't have any other choices you know we're not trying to capitalize on the or develop customer base you know to sell these people beyond release it's a tool and it was designed for the benefit of the facilities and if it helps them to cooperate and keeps my officers safer that that's a win-win for everybody it also means a lot of revenue for the jails they buy each ecig for Mosley for two to three dollars and then sell them to inmates at ten to fifteen bucks a pop at Mosley's Jail which buys the e-cigs at cost the proceeds are put back into things that benefit inmate welfare something kentucky state law mandates so one of the first things that we did was we brought in an electronic health record system this is an item that a typical jail would not be able to afford with everything that we got was about seventy-five and dollars and we were able to purchase that through our commissary proceeds that the profits that were generated from the sale of our electronic cigarette we will regularly phone to the register of course the people who pay for these benefits are the inmates themselves it's considered a luxury yeah it is definitely exclusive items my dad he's the one buying them for me so I don't I don't like to ask for anything so the cost of them gonna keeps me from smoking them as Muslim we heard there the the number one purchase at the commissary itemizing they probably are are you helping inmates or are you also kind of exploiting them to um you know I think that's a great question I think the same thing can be said for should we begin from caffeine are we making their blood pressure go up because we're getting on chips and have sowed they were loaded with sodium if you own the chip company I can't figure out if this is like a story about you know all the things you're able to do because of the e-cigs or if it's a story about a jailer who saw an opportunity and made a whole lot of money I guess that'll be for everybody else to decide when they say it making money selling e-cigs is very easy that keeping people alive and helping people is very hard my heart and my passion is here [Music] you", "AZynhX-qcc4": "it's been a nice two hours of high getting a little bit progressively stronger i'm back you guys i hope you missed me i'm finally moved into the new home i'm so excited to be here expect to see videos from me regularly again now that i've moved in i have no excuse if you're not already subscribed make sure you subscribe right now so you can see all my new videos in your sub box but today isn't going to be my typical smoking video i'm going to do something a little different i have 500 milligrams of rso capsules in here there are 10 capsules and they're 50 milligrams each actually looking at this many pills is pretty intimidating i'm not gonna lie i'm pretty much just going to film the aftermath of this so i hope you guys enjoy that this is a little bit of a different video for me but i think this is going to be a lot of fun got a nice tough glass of water to wash these down here's number one here's number two here's number three number four this is the point in our return at this point i'm getting [ __ ] lit number five all right halfway there number six i'm so scared my body like didn't want to swallow that one it was like dude don't do it i'm gonna start a timer right now before i forget so we can tell how long it takes for this to actually kick in i've never actually consumed rso before so i have no idea and i'm stone sober right now so it's gonna hit me like a brick wall all right number seven number eight number nine and last but not least number ten the point of no return wish me luck you guys this is gonna be a long day well it has been an entire minute and i'm not high at all yet i can confirm that honestly i'm a little nervous i've read online that rso can take up to 15 hours to kick in i don't think it's gonna take me that long but that's some of my brief googling told me and before this kicks in i'll explain to you what rso is for those of you who don't know it stands for rick simpson oil it's a cannabis extract but it's not meant to be dabbed like most cannabis extracts let me reiterate please do not dab this it tastes like [ __ ] it is not a fun experience it's much better to be consumed orally like through a pill or through some food it really doesn't have a nice consistency to it or taste so honestly the pill form that i just did is the best way to consume it so you don't have any of that weird flavor rso offers a lot of medical benefits when you're doing what i'm doing not really but it actually does especially for people who can't smoke but as i said this was a super [ __ ] high dose so i'm really curious about what's gonna happen to me i'm really not a huge edible guy like i said even when i've done 150 and 250 milligrams i really just don't enjoy the high i get so i'm really curious what this 500 milligram high is going to be like all right guys we just passed the 45 minute mark and i'm still not high i feel like this is gonna take as long as an edible to kick in so within the next 45 minutes i'm expecting to feel pretty rocked i was just going through my snapchats and somebody messaged me though and said that it took four hours for theirs to kick in so i'm really hoping i don't have to sit here for four hours waiting for this to kick in straight up it has been over an hour and a half and i'm really not that high like i might feel a little something but i honestly think it's all in my own head ultimately i don't think i'm high yet i hope this isn't a fail because i'm gonna be really pissed if this bottle just does nothing to me there's the stats for you as you can see 500 milligrams pack of 10 thc terpenes all that all right let's kick it oh my god i feel like edibles here you're talking [ __ ] bro it's starting to kick in i can like start to feel it in my chest and in my head a little bit it hasn't hit me like a brick yet i just thought this is gonna hit me way harder it's definitely a gradual high i'm actually feeling now it straight up took two hours and 13 minutes for me to feel anything but i'm feeling pretty hopeful right now finally my eyes are getting pretty heavy my whole body's getting that like slow feeling that you get on edibles so i have a feeling it's about to kick in all right well i'm bored i'm gonna go play with my dog or something paper paper high piper you're a dog dog oh my god you're a dog oh my god come here i'm so high oh my god oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] i'm piper sit high five oh i'm too high yeah shake my hand good job piper you guys want to see something kind of funny my dog is an overbite i honestly feel like i'm just melting at this point like oh my god these edibles kicked in pretty strong my entire body just feels heavy i'm gonna try to catch a quick dub on fall guys let's see how this goes bruh i've never felt like i've been running this low in this game i think like time's been slower for me no bruh bruh right i got this i can do this i can do this i can do this oh yes i'm going to qualify let's [ __ ] go bro i'm in like the top three right now [ __ ] okay that [ __ ] me [ __ ] let's do it let's do it let's do it yeah [ __ ] i was gonna be the next one all right [ __ ] this game i need to just like listen to music it's kind of like vibe and [ __ ] [Music] [Applause] i need more water i'm so [ __ ] thirsty if you have the option to get crushed ice and you don't just don't text me back anymore because we're not friends that makes a [ __ ] mess all right let's hydrate before we die drink oh my god that was like the kiss of life all right as you can see we are approaching the four hour point and as you can see my eyes are very heavy i'm not gonna lie man i'm getting higher and higher and higher which is cool i guess but do you really want to pop some rso caps and have to be like still getting higher in four hours like maybe at like certain situations but ultimately dabbing and smoking weed are still my preferred ways to consume cannabis but yeah these aren't so cascade hidden i don't know what it is but i have like a little double vision right now i'm like super foggy it's a different type of high for sure it's definitely more like a foggier body high than like a typical dab high or a typical weed high which more focuses on like the head i feel like this is mainly the body and then like the head is secondary like the head high is there but the body height is so intense that you don't even really notice the head high almost but i think i need a nap like that's not out of their own possibility for me today i'm so [ __ ] high i was really worried like i was talking a lot of [ __ ] on these for a minute there like it was two and a half hours before i really felt anything and it's been another hour and a half and i'm so much higher than i was then so i'm curious when this is gonna like cap so it's gonna be a long day you guys i hope you're down for the ride i'm sorry if this video isn't interesting i know i'm typically smoking and [ __ ] more but i'm just riding this high out dude like this is [ __ ] nuts i low-key just want to keep smoking on top of this to see what happens kind of see if it evens out the head high with the body height a little bit but i don't know if that's the wisest idea but i'm not here to make wise decisions that's nice it's [ __ ] nice i just stabbed on some white widow from calypso big fan of their concentrates they're a little bit on the more expensive side but the terpene profile is just unreal that dab actually made me feel a little bit better i feel like the body height was just too intense now that i got a nice little head high there too i'm like all right all right i'm back in this how long has it been oh how about that 420 blazing four and a half hours in and i'm still feeling very [ __ ] good the cotton mouth is just not going away no matter how much water i drink it just will not stop she's gotta pee and then we're gonna make some wings in the airfryer popcorn turns to food porn the other side hope you are liking this [ __ ] high as [ __ ] home style vlog because this is what you're getting hope you missed me now we are going to turn the air dude do you hear me i'm so [ __ ] big we're gonna turn the airfryer on um boom if you smoke weed and do not have an air fryer i really hope that you can take one thing out of this video and go buy one because it will truly save your life especially when you're high and you want some fire food now we're just gonna drop them in and oh yeah those are done all right food porn is in full effect you guys i'm so [ __ ] high let's determine how one of these is that looks fire oh yeah i think these need some buffalo sauce all right my high i should not have used hot sauce because my dumbass spilled it all over my shirt but i found one that's pretty much the same color to keep the aesthetic piper's pissed off she didn't get any chicken wings saved a couple for later but i honestly think i hit the peak of this high you guys it's really not as bad as i thought it was gonna be for some reason i just thought it was gonna be super intense i've had a lot of 100 to 200 milligram doses before but this is the first time i ever had a 500 milligram dose and for some reason i just figured it was gonna be like two or three times the intensity but i honestly don't think it is i think there's like a peak high you get when you smoke and probably even with edibles and probably just with how much i consume cannabis right now my tolerance is so high that this just wasn't too intense for me like i definitely couldn't drive or anything and i definitely wouldn't recommend anyone try consuming this much you should definitely ask your doctor before consuming any amount of thc don't ask me and don't go off my uh experience probably should have said that earlier in the video but yeah i'm really just [ __ ] tired at this point i'm high as [ __ ] i feel like i've had like all the phases of the edible at this point i feel like i had the giggles i feel like i had the like just chill high part i feel like i had the munchies and now i'm just at the like chill slumped part of the edible like i'm exhausted that's really all i have to say right now i'm gonna have a good night's sleep i'm pretty sure i just confirmed you can't overdose on weed we've been doing this just under six hours and ten minutes it'll be six hours but you know the high only kicked in three and a half hours ago if i did my math right but still being high as [ __ ] three and a half hours later that's not too bad i still don't think that this is the way i would like to consume most of the time like i feel like this is really just for people that can't smoke or like really just don't want to for whatever reason but like this just isn't as fun for me because i hate waiting for the high i like it to just come pretty much instantly it probably will come out quicker if you have a low tolerance but that's not the situation for me you know you really just don't know what how you're gonna get and i'd rather like find out right away when i rip a bong if it like got me high or not then like find out four hours later if you got high or not you know i'm just kind of rambling at this point you guys but that's the video click like if you enjoyed thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it make sure you subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way in my lovely new house with my adorable little pup leave a comment let me know what's the biggest edible you've ever had i'd like to know but it's time i take a nap thank you guys so much for watching i'm glad to be back on youtube i've missed you guys many more videos to come just you wait but my name is jeff peace", "MljAks08IKk": "so today i'm going to be doing two it's really one review of one product but two separate strains of the product it is going to be quality control thc and these are drops they're tinctures it says on here terps i don't know why they're calling them terps [Music] but this one is i got maui wowie and i have golden pineapple now the golden pineapple is a hybrid the maui is a sativa and the maui wowie i prefer the maui over the golden pineapple this is something the maui the sativa is something you're going to want to take during pretty much during the day later on in the evening and this is something that you probably would take later in the evening closer to not i'm not really a fan of i'm not a fan of anticas or indica dominant strains i like the uplifting and relaxing feeling not the stoned out of your mind feeling um this the maui is amazing i was taking these i got to get another bottle i ran out of the maui but i was taking one about a little drop i'll show you how much you should take you want to take it about i took it sorry taking about an hour after i woke up and then after that son of a [ __ ] it shows you the recommended dose on here i can't even get this [ __ ] open with one hand the recommended dose is like a fourth of the dropper that's pretty much what i stuck with it takes about 30 minutes to kick in and with the maui you will notice a calming uplifting feeling now the golden pineapple i think it's more of a anthic dominant it feels that way anyway so you take it and about again about 30 minutes you feel it but it it it's more of a couch like type of feeling for me and i do not like that they have grape ape i was gonna get grape eight but it's a pure indica and i can't i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with it but 100 would highly recommend this because i'm going to tell you some of the the great benefits of it for me is i noticed that people that normally got on my nerves didn't get on my nerves as much whenever i was whenever i had that in my system so i was able to be around people where i was not in my head as much meaning i wasn't like over analyzing every little thing that was happening or that did happen or that could happen and i was just able to i guess step back and enjoy things more now uh another pleasant side effect of this is it does not this is going to sound odd to say but it it kind of it kind of decreases your appetite i have noticed like it doesn't give you much use it doesn't it even makes you not spill hungry and another bro amazing side effect for me for me was it i'll take kratom i have kratom reviews coming up and i was taking too much credit my thought i still think i was because i was taking like an ounce to an ounce and a half a day and now once i started taking this i was able to get a three ounce bag to last me like five six days so we cut my kratom usage in half so i'm definitely going to pick up the um i'm definitely going to grab more of the maui wowie definitely going to grab more than maui now the golden pineapple i still have [ __ ] i still have about three fourths of a bottle left with this so i am going to use that before i get more maui and i do want to say these retailed for 29.99 30 even at my local dispensary or botanical shop i have noticed uh with a lot of these products that you can order them offline for cheaper as opposed to going into your local dispensary or botanical shop the only issue with that is by the time you wait for it and you cover shipping you're paying about the same price unless you get a large quantity so just ordering one of these offline if you don't have them in your area go ahead and order them offline because you'll pay the same price as you if you walked into your local dispensary slash botanical shop but if you get a high quality of things definitely definitely order online or look around your area to try to find better deals because uh i have something that i'm going to going to get today that i'm going to review and talk about how i ended up switching dispensaries botanical shops then i had to drive an extra 20 minutes but the price the quality the uh just the friendliness i guess you could say of this place drew me there i still [ __ ] with a shout out to advanced botanicals still [ __ ] with those guys uh but this new shot man uh hook i mean they hook you up they're super chill super nice they give you samples they uh will mix [ __ ] up for you they will make i mean it's just amazing so today i'm going to get a kilo of white elephant white endo and white hulu mixed and then i'm getting some delta 10 thc which i'm going to review on here probably in the upcoming days i'm planning on getting the delta 10 cart and then i'm getting the cookies cart delta 8 cart it's it's a knockoff cookies it looks slack to me it's called cake i think or something like that i have to do a little bit more research on that but i've tried it from a friend and it was amazing so my my last um final say on this is it is wonderful definitely get it definitely check it out it's kind of like for micro dosing something to help you micro dose so you're not taking huge uh so let's just say you've got an edible and you want a micro dose and edible it's hard to it's hard to get an exact dosage unless you get ones that are you know like 25 or 15 milligrams per cube or per gummy and even then um you might take it and wait 45 minutes and not feel anything then you take a half of one and then they kick in together and you're you're you're you're done for the day or maybe the next two days edibles are hard to micro dose these are extremely easy to micro dose so if you're interested in micro dosing check them out it will give you a calm but uplifted relaxed feeling um that's all i'm going to say about it highly recommend we're going to do five stars here what i think of it and i'm gonna rate this a solid four stars this product quality control carts delta eight thc so definitely go check them out it is worth it and also guys i i'm extremely excited about this because you i have a ridiculous amount of delta 8 delta 9 soon to be delta 10 products i have a ridiculous amount of like cart of um pan reviews of box reviews of kratom reviews different kinds of kratom so please stay tuned i have psychedelic videos coming soon back and i'm also going to continue to talk about the reality as it is so hope you guys stay tuned for all that it's game of form in the play of life i am you talking to you love you guys", "xQexZcgxxYM": "alright guys so basically fake carts are pretty bad for you okay [ __ ] but we've been knew that okay yeah but they're also harmful for your lungs though okay yeah and I've been knew that too alright [ __ ] did you know that they're actually killing people now well no more did you know that 60 to 70 percent of black market carts are contaminated with a chemical that no one should actually be inhaling I mean nah I didn't know that either but like or that as of September 11 2019 450 cases of pulmonary disease have been attributed to the use of black market carts yeah I bet you didn't know that I bet you also didn't know that there are now six deaths that are reported as a result of these carts so just go ahead sit down and watch this video because I'm gonna be talking about some important [ __ ] in it so yeah roll the [ __ ] intro alright fine so why is blinks he's sitting in his hot ass room a 90 degree weather yelling about why you guys shouldn't use fake cards well first off I do want to say that I personally have stopped really using them I don't hit them unless I like have to do a review of them and then I'll either throw them out or give them away with the warning that I don't want to use this myself I hope you don't use it but you know some people just don't care anyway I know that fake hearts have been affecting me I can feel it oh now that I've stopped really using them and I really just smoked lead and abs at this point I've gotten so much better being able to take hits of weed before quitting cards I couldn't even hit weed you all have seen it on this channel it's been held for me oh and I always thought that it was just weed itself that was messing with me so I thought oh maybe hearts are better oh but after quitting them or at least not using them as heavenly as I used to I have noticed such improvement with my own lungs oh it's great honestly once I gave Princess crying so anyway first off I do want to talk about all the vitamin E acetate stuff that has been going around the internet lately I went through a lot of websites did a lot of research took a lot of notes so I'm just gonna try to get my best to explain to you guys in terms I was able to understand I'm not gonna be talking down to y'all because I know you are intelligent and I just want to be honest with you guys from my own experience because that's what this whole channel is based off is my experiences with things and my opinion though so anyway let's actually get into this so first off what is vitamin E acetate vitamin E acetate is a diluting agent that's usually used for very heavy oils such as THC wax but the thing about vitamin E II acetate is that it started out and was mainly used for cosmetic purposes for like soaps and topical ointments and [ __ ] ever since 2000 actually people have been saying that they've been inhaling it and getting sick from it people put topicals around their nose and after inhaling all the fumes they were getting what is called the BOE pneumonia that's what's showing up again with the people who are smoking these fake cards 5 people in North Carolina were actually found to have lippy white pneumonia which is when fat from oils gets into your lungs and gets stuck there the way that's happening is the fact that vitamin E acetate is an oil that is never supposed to be inhaled but why do we as donors have to worry about vitamin E acetate the reason we have to wear is because the people who supply cards to our black market they're really just trying to make the most money they can obviously it's a business it's a very booming business so people are gonna be trying to make money any way they can it's sort of throwing our health away because they don't care we're just dollar signs to them your plug might may or may not care about you but half the time your plug isn't even making the cart see selling you you know when you're buying these carts that have this vitamin e acetate in them and you are inhaling them you're inhaling stuff that you're not supposed to inhale you're inhaling oils that are not supposed to be in your lungs if people got sick from inhaling it through their nose imagine us who are actually just taking the [ __ ] to our lungs and exhaling it again it's terrible for you what's very very unfortunate is that three of the biggest manufacturers of diluting agent sport arts have been found to have high amounts of despite of mini acetate stuff in there diluting agents and it's even said from them that around sixty to seventy percent or fifty million carts on the black market probably have this chemical in them that we're not inhale that's a big reason why everyone you see on YouTube on Instagram like even in legal states is telling you do not buy cars from black market only buy them from license dispensaries the reason they do that is because license manufacturers can only sell to license dispensaries and delivery services if you're buying on black market you have no idea what you're actually getting and it could really be anything [Music] all right that there we go brand-new hey you hey you you prepubescent teenage boy you wanna buy some drugs oh yeah yeah you you you want to buy a clerk yeah buy a car what's in it what strain oh it's so asparagus oh gee you is that good shoes from Cali merica I get my ship [ __ ] I get my [ __ ] ship from Cali bro all straight all straight good [ __ ] good quality Cali cards all [ __ ] like like people be saying like yo yo yo [ __ ] fake but I'll be like nah sorry [ __ ] from Cali like I'm telling you man it's called good I won't hit it myself believe you want to hit it go for it oh that sounds dope how much yeah so because that car is a high quality in from Cali I'm gonna be charging you around like 80 bucks for it that's just how much it is like that's a good price I promise is from Kathy okay $50 I have that I saved up like three weeks oh dang alright here's your cut whoa a cart [Music] oh [ __ ] where's a little okay I guess so the fact that we're buying these cards because we either have no choice which is my still own problem like I still cannot get legit carts anywhere so I have to still buy black-market I know it's that way with a lot of you guys if you're watching this video and even if it's not and you live in a legal state I would implore you to actually start trying to go to dispensaries and buying hurts it your health is worth the extra markup um and you at that point have an opportunity that a lot of us do not so just take advantage of it you know so a big thing I'm seeing in the news is that in New York Governor Andrew Cuomo just grouped ecigs and THC vapes into one a nice trying to ban flavor vapes for everyone I think that is probably one of the dumbest decisions ever and just pretty much shows how out of touch politicians can be when it comes to black market cannabis or just cannabis in general faint juice itself is not something that you really have to worry about so it upsets me that they're grouping ecigs and eliquid with THC vape and THC concentrates because we're not getting the help that we need when it comes to regulation that way they're just trying to ban a bunch of stuff under a big umbrella instead of looking at the actual problem and trying to fix it but the biggest problem is is that cannabis isn't legal for everyone so it cannot be regulated it's hard to [ __ ] regulate the cannabis market because there are no government standards for it legal states have created their own standards and they're trying their best but for the rest of the country who wants to partake in this medicine it's hard for us to try to figure out what's safe what's not safe what's convenient what's not convenient what's legal and illegal it's a lot to have to worry about so it's a big reason I understand why carts are as popular as they are they're convenient they don't smell they're easy to hide there's so many benefits to them it's a real shame honestly that the whole market is getting flooded with this terrible [ __ ] as I said in my intro as of September 11th when I wrote all of my notes and the day before I'm recording this 450 cases of pulmonary disease which is lung disease tied to these black-market carts and six deaths I'm seeing a lot of memes about like people are getting all up in arms about lay six deaths from vaping but I don't really think they understand the severity of it where it's not just six people died from vaping it's six people dying from a market that is flooded with poison at this point a lot of reason why people including me are now saying don't smoke fake hearts it's just because we want you guys to be safe that's all as a youtuber I feel like it is my job to give you guys what is an educated opinion and to steer you guys in the right direction I do my best to do that and I don't want any of you guys to get hurt because I care about every one of you who are watching this video even if I don't know you personally I still care about you as a fellow as a fellow stoner or just a fellow enthusiast for cannabis you know so the three companies that are the biggest perpetrators in this whole situation are Hunnicutt uber thick and pure diluting I tried to look up all of these companies to find any information on them Hunnicutt seems like it's been used because I can't find anything on it except for on eBay here and I Luton as well I can't really find a lot of stuff on these are all used in our black market carts and they're all very bad for you and as I said 60 to 70 percent of all of our carts have this [ __ ] in them all of these companies have been offered have been served subpoenas which means they're all under investigation right now and of all of the cards that the CDC has been testing now um I think they have of around a thousand samples but 10 out of the first 18 that they tested have come back with this vitamin e acetate in them I've personally really stopped using fake cards I'm about to show you why but I'll explain it real quick I tried doing that 100 hits challenge for my 2,000 subscribers special it was gonna be something I was really excited about I got around 90 hits in I'm not even gonna front oh I ended up losing like 20 hits of footage but I scrapped the video and have all of the footage on my computer still a big reason why I stopped hearts after that challenge was because I threw up nine times oh I smoked three different cards and I smoked weed during that challenge out of those three cards I Green nine times of those nine times two times were from a doctor zodiac spake part and seven times I green because I was smoking on a damn list card it was a strawberry Devils curry and even in the video I went back and watched my review of it and wondered why I gave it a 7 out of 10 I am kicking myself for that review I almost want to delete it because I do not suggest that buzz anymore I don't [ __ ] with them I do not take them oh I have a review coming out of them next Monday where I even say I don't like them anymore oh but i'ma show you guys the footage of this because for me I think cannabis should make you feel happy it should make you feel comfortable it should just make you feel good and at one point during that challenge I literally was sitting down and just thought I feel disgusting I do not want to continue this and I hate the fact that cannabis made me feel that way and I don't want anyone else to have to feel that way because of cannabis because I think it is so important oh I think Andrew Cuomo is a [ __ ] jackass for grouping eliquid and a THC liquid together because this is a very real problem and trying to attack joules and [ __ ] again is not gonna save any of us Oh so if you guys are okay with seeing a bit of gross Ness I'm going to show you guys probably the worst parts of that challenge so you guys can know why I'm telling you to please stop smoking cards but if you're still not convinced after that I can't really change your opinion you know but either way let's get into that alright so Loki another reason I want to do this challenge is because I really don't know if hitting fake hearts this often is very very harmful I'm gonna find out um before you all are in my comments saying blink see why the [ __ ] are you smoking fake cards do you not care about yourself honestly no but hear me out I smoked around probably 20 hits every time I'm just like recording a video um I know I don't show all of the hits but like while I'm recording that's a lot of hits or if I'm like making gameplay videos I'll hit this thing around 20 times anyway so I'm used to smoking this much it's not really gonna like kill me or anything I don't think but um this is sort of like a live excites experiment for real we're gonna find out if fake arts are terrible for you I think this one is bad I really don't like hitting this car I might actually not hit it much more depending on how it makes me feel so I will have to waste a lot of that live card but for now we're just gonna soldier on with this [Music] [Music] I have a fake card I have a bunch of fake hearts what do I do with them um I mean I can show you what I would do with the cards right now actually let's go do that alright so the gag took a bit longer than I really expected it to but uh basically I'm about to just run over all these fake cards so yeah let me go ahead and do that I just I feel like it'd look cool [Music] can I just say I ran over these [ __ ] around three four times and this one is still okay I think this one is yeah [ __ ] dab what is still okay and this other dank babes still okay so uh I think I'm gonna end up running over these ones again but uh yeah these ones broke so that that made the guy work a little bit let's try and see if I can get these ones to break - [ __ ] these carts alright so now we're doing it take two of running over these carts again [ __ ] fake cards and let's do it alright it's a fun story my family came outside to ask me why I was just backing up and then going for you get in our driveway I explained to them that I was saying [ __ ] fake carts and I don't really think they understood me so that's awkward but anyway let's get back inside alright you guys so after everything in this video what do I want you guys to take away from it basically if you live in a legal state please start buying your carts only from dispensaries or licensed delivery services weed Maps is a sort of good source because it'll at least give you the names of dispensaries in your area and then you can use your judgement or there are a few signs to look for when it comes to looking at legit dispensaries I'll go over that in a future video but if you live in a legal state please start buying your carts from dispensaries not black-market oh I don't really care about whatever else you buy from the black market but for carts especially do not buy them from black market anymore if you have if you live in an illegal state and you have to buy from black market then there are still some carts that will probably be safer for you than others but my best advice to you would be if you can switch from carts to something else do that because it's really not the risk carts will probably just eventually start being okay again but as of right now they are definitely not safe for you um if you're still gonna be smoking cards either way of course I'm still gonna be making reviews on carts oh I don't really suggest carts right now especially like i said 'dad woods I really really have a vendetta against them though um but I don't really suggest carts anymore but I am still going to be trying to do some sort of reviews of them because I do know that there still is gonna be a big amount of my audience that doesn't live in legal states and has to get these oh but I am gonna personally start switching more to just wheat and dads and I would implore you guys to do the same some things I did want to go over a quick that I sort of forgot to earlier um one is that vitamin E acetate is actually illegal to be used in substances that are to be inhaled in some states but in all of the West Coast states for some reason it's still not regulated um that's probably gonna be a law that they passed soon but it is definitely something that I wish was passed sooner because a lot of what is flooding the black markets are coming from west coast since West Coast is so huge in cannabis in general oh I also do want to say that one death was from someone who bought vapes from a dispensary which is why I'm saying only go to licensed dispensaries there are a license and unlicensed dispensaries and pretty much every legal state um and you can really really tell which ones are like more which ones are licenses which ones are a bit more shady um stay away from the shady ones only because I don't want you guys to get hurt Oh so yeah moving forward I think those are the things that are gonna be able to keep us the most safe um I hope you enjoyed this video if you did watch it and you at least got something out of it because I did work pretty hard

subscribe if you're not already and please leave in the comments anything that you want to say about the whole topic because I am curious about what you guys's thoughts are on it I had a lot of people asking me what cards I think are safe and which ones aren't um I'll just give you a quick list right now as far as cards that I personally think might be a bit safer I would say the black tip TKOs I've been having really good experience with those lately on live East Coast I've had also good experiences with elite meds I had a good experiences with unfortunately that's pretty much it so even still I wouldn't really go out of your way to go buy black market carts but if you are living in black market States or if you aren't living in black market states where you don't have a medical card oh then those would be the brands that I haven't found any effects of my on myself I'll catch you guys on I'll catch you guys tomorrow actually with some scary games I hope you guys will come through that but either way thank you guys for watching and I'll see you all later peace [Music]", "g4tHSckLfGk": "[Music] [Music] only thing i care about is living life the best i could only want to smoke

terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor
