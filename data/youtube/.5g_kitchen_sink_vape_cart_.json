{"qGjvbtb-XO0": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel I'm so excited to have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks for watching brothers and sisters leave me a comment let me know what you think you like the strain you

smoking", "HrDbe_WPuHc": "how's going YouTube this is outs coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today I'm super excited about this one we have the best oil pens and 510 threaded batteries of 2020 a lot of your experience will come down to your battery cartridge and oil all working together in harmony but the battery is the thing you have the most control over so choosing one or even multiple batteries that match your needs is the most important thing obviously the better the battery the better your experience will be with your cartridge and oil also because these batteries are relatively inexpensive and you might find yourself with multiple carts it's perfectly OK to own up more than one of them I personally have three that I cycle through if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go scrubbing your way through it at least leave us a like before you bounce and if you'd like to pick up any of the batteries I talked about today links will be in the description below without further ado let's get into it sitting in our number one spot this year is the tronie inline of 510 batteries trone ian landed in the market with a splash releasing a handful of batteries all at once the line consists of three batteries the neutron hITRON and tau tron and an oil cartridge called the tron pod they also have a disposable battery which I'll touch on later what I like about Rhoni and batteries is that they've nailed the space between budget-friendly and performance with a device for every consumer their units are versatile and calibrated to work more effectively with a wide range of 510 cartridges and oils the patron is one of the cheapest and smallest offerings of the Tyrolean line along with a distinct pen shape it also has draw activation which works with any draw activated cart so make sure you check the instructions on your cartridge before choosing a battery the Piton battery is built sturdily and can handle any size 510 threaded car it has 350 ml amp hours of power which is impressive for a unit of this size and price point and I absolutely love that there is a USB charger on the bottom of the device it couldn't possibly be any easier to use just screw your cartridge on and inhale the neutron is another incredibly budget-friendly battery and just like the patron comes in at under $15 offering a very similar pen shape the neutron has a one button three voltage settings and a preheat function the on-board voltages are two point six three point three and 4.0 volts giving you a large range to work with that preheat function I touched on before does a great job of warming thicker oils and concentrates it is universally compatible and should be able to power most carts you throw at it five tabs will turn it on two will change between temperatures and three will activate that preheat function it is no larger than a literal pen and can be completely hidden by most hands for some stealth vaping at the top of their lineup is the Tao Tron the Tao John features a magnetic adapter for your carts that you can easily screw on to the base of your 510 threaded cartridge that will allow the cartridge to slip completely inside the housing protecting your car from damage the couch on has been designed to automatically detect the resistance of your cartridge and is calibrated to accept almost any viscosity of oil when fully charged it has a max voltage of 4.2 volts when you draw from the tower on there's a light that illuminates at the bottom of the device to show that power is being supplied to your cartridge the design is just super clean and I love the fact that they have cutouts to show your oil levels which is certainly a feature I prefer for my batteries there's nothing worse than taking a dry head it is draw activated and features a 380 million power battery that charges via USB and even for the top of their line the tower on is extremely budget-friendly I like everything about this device from the size to the power I love how small the tower on is it's shorter than other pens it's smaller than other mods it just works and that's why it's my number one choice I know a lot of your experience is gonna be down to buying prefilled cartridges but for those who like to fill their own cartridge Choa nyan has also released the Tron pod the Tron pods are perfectly calibrated from the tronie in line to offer maximum efficiency they also offer better wicking than most cartridges on the market meaning less time waiting and filling and less dry hits I've also been told some oil producers will be working with Tony and to get these Tron pods filled so keep an eye out for that lastly TRO nyan does offer their disposable vape pen the alphatron the alphatron is the solution for anyone looking for a disposable pen that also has a childproof lock it is designed for one-time use and is geared towards those who prefer to fill up their own cartridges the battery comes pre charged with enough juice to finish the attached Tron pod considering you get an empty cartridge and a battery for the price it's not bad at all the literal only issue I have with it is the spelling alpha with an F come on people as a Greek boy I cannot stand by and watch this travesty happen alpha is spelt with a pH okay droning sitting in our number-two spot this year we have the vessel battery if you are a classy as [ __ ] oh no sir with a need for the top of the top rugged devices look no further than the vessel it is a seriously gorgeous device that comes in a plethora of colors to suit your tastes there are three voltage settings on the vessel 2.8 3.2 and 3.6 bolts there is a notable difference between the voltage settings as well and the vessel can handle any cartridge with aplomb I've been using mine for a while now and I've never put a cartridge in that it could handle if you have a wider diameter cart you will have to forego the shield but it's super easy to take off the vessel is a 240 million power battery that you can get about a hundred rips on before it needs to be recharged it is slightly larger than your average oil pen but it's nothing to write home about as it still fits in any pocket or bag and the included cartridge protector can stave off most dents and scratches and keep your cartridge safe I really like the performance and look of this device it makes me feel super classy as I'm taking ribs in an alleyway on my way to the grocery store the price point is a bit high but if you want a top-of-the-line high performance device the vessel is the battery for you in the number three spot we have the tried and tested and true pocket one plus a great device with a lot of versatility the pocket oneplus has a wide cartridge area and can accept almost any cart you throw at it don't throw your carts at it and then blame me and please just don't do it don't it also works with top and bottom airflow cartridges which is pretty cool the pocket oneplus is another solid device that protects your carts from breaking it also has that magnetic adapter just like the tower on the and it has three temperature settings which is just the icing on the cake it runs up three point seven four point three and five point one volts if anyone cares I use the preheat function quite a bit yes it does have a pretty heat function another thing to love about the pocket oneplus the pocket oneplus has a 660 million hour battery that should last you a number of days even if you're a heavy user ok this is not a challenge don't come back to me and say I hit it 483 times in 30 minutes and the battery died that battery tops up in about 45 minutes which is also pretty great the oneplus is a great size and the button placement is spectacular I'm laughing because I might be the only person that cares about button placement but seriously it's great 5 clicks will turn it on to will change temperature 3 will activate that preheat function it's just simple to use just like the vessel the price point is a touch high but if you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks you will certainly not be disappointed coming in at number four the C cell battery lineup has two great devices for use with your favorite oil the palm is a great budget-friendly device that is built really well it protects your cartridge and features a 500 million power battery simply screw the magnetic adapter onto your cartridge and slot it into the base the palm fits easily inside your hand great chest and is a great buddy for a night out the silo is the palms slightly bigger brother it keeps most of the same features we loved about the palm like that 500 milliamp hour battery and the fact that it protects your cart the silo fits into any pocket and you won't be worried about any damage to your cart because of that card protection I touched on earlier it also has the little newer slot so you can monitor the level of your oil in the cartridge there is no voltage control to speak up on either C cell device but for the price point I don't see that as a big drawback at all I personally find the silo to have a slightly better form factor and I just like the way it fits in my hand either way C cell batteries are built really well and a solid pick for any user the only thing I would note the narrower cartridge opening means they are not universally compatible but again a minor issue sitting in our number 5 spot the Lynx herm\u00e8s 3 is a solid pen this ultra slim slick device does a good job of pumping out clouds but where it really shines is flavor the ceramic atomizer does a good job of pulling the terpenes out of your oil it has three voltage settings to customize the flavor and the density of your clouds the atomizer doesn't leak and wicks really well this is a solid choice for anyone who sources their own oil and wants a refillable device complete with a tank as the atomizer is really good quality and can handle being refilled multiple times the kit itself comes with the pen the USB charger and the handy carrying case which is really typical of links and just gives you everything you need also typical is their consistency with build quality as the hermes 3 is a well-built device that features a 290 million power battery it's super easy to use five taps will turn it on three will change voltage settings and as long as your buddy Jon knows how to press a button and inhale at the same time you should be okay to pass this around at parties without having to explain to anything I'll leave the choice on whether or not to do so up to you and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video I hope I helped you even a little bit to choose the battery that will work best with your favorite oil if you enjoyed this video if you learned something please tap to have that like button if you really enjoyed it hit subscribe in that little Bell to stay up to date on all of our latest

keep baby", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "MWDniwcf064": "one two three four five hey how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from a berry these were fooled some of those Mayberry if you're not taking it might get up with this but I got 34 silent ones hope this information was valuable", "U_Ka0JKesCY": "[Music] what up y'all said [ __ ] Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did

faucet then Co offers a variety of products to solve the problem without replacing the entire faucet while having to call a plumber saving you valuable time and money with a few short steps and the right replacement parts for venko your pasta will be returned to like-new condition here are the tools you will need for this job a flathead screwdriver philips head screwdriver wrench an allen wrench which is optional and cleaner to remove mineral buildup first you will need to turn off the hot and cold water supply valve under the sink next you will need to remove the single lever handle this may require using an allen wrench to loosen the handle there may be a button that covers the screw that needs to be removed first and then you can loosen the screw and remove the lever handle there are two different ways the cartridge may be removed from your faucet depending on whether it is secured with a retainer clip or retainer nut use a wrench to remove the retainer next pull the cartridge from your faucet now that you remove the cartridge you need to take it to your local retailer and use the perfect matchbook to locate your cartridge go to the one handle repair tab and match your cartridge to the photograph you may also want to replace the retainer nut or clip at this time before installing the new cartridge thoroughly clean the inside of the faucet body with cleaner intended to remove mineral buildup or use plain vinegar the last thing you want to do is damage your new cartridge because you did not clean the mineral buildup inside the faucet it is imperative that you complete this step or this can cause new leaks to happen soon after you have installed a new cartridge now you're ready to install the new cartridge insert the new cartridge in the same position as the old cartridge be sure to line up any alignment pegs with the holes in the faucet body be sure to check your cartridge and determine if it has been lined up correctly replace any retainer nuts or clips that you took out in the removal process replace your lever handle and screw on securely replace the cover button if there is one finally turn on the hot and cold water supply under the sink

or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional questions or concerns be sure

dripping well sooner or later you're going to have to repair one of these and it's a lot easier than you think stay tuned and I'll show you how [Music] your permit in here from Dirt Farmer g.com we really like this type of faucet set this particular one is from Delta all the other manufacturers have this style as well it's called a single lever faucet and sometimes they're on the side like this on across the deck other times there's a base plate that's right here and there's one lever behind it this one has a higher gooseneck with an extendable flex hose which we really really like but there's a lot going on in one little place in this faucet setup that you need to take care of and be aware of fortunately it's a modular system now the faucet that I'm actually repairing is a Delta 978 SSDD st and you can see on the instruction manual this faucet is about 10 years old now and it's just now starting to develop some issues where you have to be very precise at putting it back in the right position and jiggle it a little bit and stop the drip it's really annoying so but ten years of service that's pretty doggone good and so this particular manual that came with this is for all of these models which we put in the search terms below so if you're looking to repair this likely you've landed here for one of these faucets right here but if you have another manufacturer all the systems are not identical but they take the same approach where you have a replaceable cartridge now it may not be real obvious to you as you can see this drip is just keep going and going where the cartridge is but it's right here right down in this here this is the soap dispenser this happens to be a reverse osmosis water dispenser but this is where all the magic happens so what you're going to be replacing if you have either water coming out from underneath the trim water that continues here you can't get it to shut off correctly you're going to be replacing this cartridge now there's a lot going on in this little device and there's nothing in this device that is serviceable by anybody it's all integrated so you can't take little parts out of it replace washers and the materials now are a lot better than they used to be they're ceramics in this some really high-strength plastics a lot of good ware surfaces but there's a lot happening in this little device let me show you what I mean if you look at the bottom of this it kind of looks like a almost like a monkey in a gas mask but anyway you can kind of see here that one of these is the hot water inlet the other side is the cold water inlet this whole area up here then mixes that and the proportion you call for and then the water comes out mixed at the temperature you want back out this up the pipeline back in out the spout so you've got inlets and an outlet all happening right there plus you have an integrated seal that's across the bottom there that is already there ready to go and if you look on the top here's your control handle but inside there you'll see this little orange slider that is your temperature limiter that tells you how much hot water is allowed in from the hot water side to greatly reduce the likelihood or the possibility of scalding from a water heater that's set really hot and you end up with just putting real almost boiling water out of the sea you can first of all you probably shouldn't have your water heater set that hot but you've got uncomfortable hot water coming out of this then you can adjust that right there using that and there's instructions on it well let's get to work and let's take this apart so here is our replacement cartridge we'll put that in here and as you can see I went and turned off the water make sure you do that and you have a mess as you can see we have no water pressure here now at all so we're done now the next thing we're going to need to do here's just something a little thing you want to be careful of we're going to be pulling a little hot and cold indicator a little logo out from under that covers the Allen screw that attaches the handle to the stem here so when we pull that out that thing falls off and goes down the drain it's not going to be a good day so I'm going to go ahead and just take a just try to put that down there or if I have a stopper handy I do that we're going to put a little screwdriver under that pull that out and as you can see it's a little cover red for hot blue for cold hot on the Left blue on the right so let's go ahead and move that off the side now you're going to need an 8 inch hex key also known as an Allen wrench and I like to use these tee times because it allows me to reach up there far enough and you're going to put that in and get that into that handle set and then hold on to the top and undo it you can see that it's got some good grip grip good bite so let's see if I got a nut there it is off it came so there's the handle and now you're going to see over here a retainer that's holding this trim piece now to be honest with you I already took this off once just to make sure that I had everything ready to go and the caulk that was down at the bottom holding this in place has been removed you after you are done you're going to put caulk around this and just keep water out from under it but now see that it's caught it won't come up so what you have to do is push these little deals in until it lets go then the whole thing will lift off sometimes that black ring right there will stay behind and then you need to lift it off other times it comes off but now you have the retainer that holds the trim package now we're down to this piece and this is what you see here I'm just going to match the limiter settings as you can see it's just slightly away from the left and that's the way we're going to set it here that's the off position and of course it's going to go in the same way and there are little locator pins at the bottom that make sure that you don't put this in backwards or sideways it can only go correctly and that is the correct way now this is the bonnet nut and like we said you're going to find this and all of these sip systems like this so take yourself a large crescent wrench it's brass so be careful or for your purists instead of a crescent wrench that's an adjustable wrench and we're going to adjust that till it is actually very nicely snug because I don't want to round that off and then we're going to take this and start turning and as you can see it starts turning it's pretty finger tight off it comes so this comes up off comes the whole item there's the base that's there leave that alone you're simply going to drop this out and as you can see there's your two locator sockets right there then match up these two locator pins that goes right back like that and all the integrated gasket is all in place you can only fit here's the inlet Inlet hot cold outbound to the spout so we're going to put it in just like this this comes back over the top I'm going to screw that down make sure that you got that nice some people like to sanitize this we're just going to finger tighten it down for right now make sure that everything feels good and it does then we'll go ahead and take our adjustable wrench and again make sure it's nice and tight on the side and then just cinch it down the idea is not to see how strong you can be just bring it down so it's nice and there's a little bit of gauging on this as you can see that started to turn meaning that I actually had over start to tighten it so I brought it back we should be fine here and I'm going to do something really quickly I'm gonna run down turn back on the water because even that this will operate right now just by doing this let's make sure we don't have any leaks develop here everything runs right before I put the trim back on okay let's all go turn the water on okay so we've turned back on the water downstairs both a hot and cold side to make sure we're testing everything and put that back up the litter there with nice water there shuts off real cleanly I'll go left to hot it's going to take a moment here but definitely and starting to warm up and I'm gonna go to the right just get pure cold whoa you can't bill that's cold we have nice well water and so you can see what's going under the pin pack and just shut it off I'm just gonna pull it forward and straight down look at that no drips whatsoever all right we're ready to put the trim back on we're gonna go the retainer okay and we have that in place and I split it so it's on both sides of this right here I would run a bead of caulk all around in this first and I won't waste your time doing that but use a good silicone great caulk and I've got something that's a real aluminized so it looks really nice with the stainless I'm going to put that over line up those little indents with that took it in and there you go it's very nice now we're simply going to go ahead and place our and it fits over very nicely it finds it it's real solid and then we're going to go ahead and use our wrench underneath locate our allen wrench and allen key and then only a couple turns tighten that down nice look at there very nice very clean boom well how's that for a fast and simple repair these repair kits are about thirty-five dollars but you think about it ten years of life thirty-five bucks three dollars and fifty cents about a penny a day for a great system that we really liked and boy there's many times when you've got your handful or whatever a handful that you can

cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "GcFstm8epYQ": "all righty youtubers this is how to fix your Delta Faucet my handle got frozen on there and I called Delta and they recommended vinegar and water and all kind of other crazy solutions I ended up drilling it off Delta did send me a new handle and a new cartridge this is the old handle that I drilled off and that's the new one on there with a new cartridge installed but what I found interesting is if you guys aren't under warranty and need a new cartridge you may be able to repair your old one I'm going to take this apart and show you how this cartridge comes apart and what I found there's two tabs on here one on this side and then one on the other side just to I found that if I get right underneath this part here with this recommended tool here probably a razor blade would be a little bit better but you can get your knife underneath there it just pops off and this comes out there's a ceramic disc in there pay attention how you take it apart but everything is notched and slotted for the most part so even if you forget it won't be too difficult to put it back together but what I found was as I took this mechanism apart there was sludge in here sludge in there the ceramic discs out sludge all in these parts I've cleaned them out and put a silicone grease on them whether that's recommended I don't know but but in any event this all will go back together and I'm assuming that's going to take care of the problem the faucet was shutting off but it took extra force to close it because of all the sludge built up in there so I would recommend trying to clean this out before you go out and spend 20 bucks on a new cartridge hope this helps bye", "UZg6k8DdL0c": "hi I'm Tom from signature hardware if your kitchen faucet is leaking or the handles that stopped turning properly it could be caused by a buildup of sediment and hard water deposits in the faucet cartridge in this video we're going to show you how to clean the cartridge yourself and get your faucet working smoothly again we're going to need a couple of tools for the job an open-ended wrench maybe an Allen wrench screwdriver plastic bowl a bucket of clean water a towel and an extra pair of hands first you'll need to shut off the water supply valves located under your sink turn the valves clockwise to close them then turn on both your hot and cold water taps to drain any excess water from the faucet once that's done turn the taps back to the off position at this point it's a good idea to close or block the drain this will keep any small parts from falling into it arrange a towel behind the faucet to absorb any water now we're going to remove the faucet handles faucet handles can differ by model but they're typically attached by a screw if there's a decorative cap or button on the handle you'll want to take that off first to get to the script if there's a discussion or other trim remove that as well now loosen the cartridge assembly with your wrench and remove it your faucet cartridge may look different than the one we have here but the steps for cleaning them are essentially the same if you have an extra pair of hands to help you now would be a good time to put them to use place the plastic bowl upside down over the faucet hole to direct water spray towards the drain have your extra set of hands turn on the hot water supply under the sink while you hold the bowl let the water run for about three or four seconds this will flush out any debris trapped in the faucet or in the water line once this is done turn the hot water supply off and then repeat the process for the cold water now we're going to rinse out the cartridges by placing them individually in the bucket of clean water open and close the cartridges by twisting the stem you may have to place the handle on temporarily to move them now reinsert the cartridges then reassemble the handles it's important not to over tighten the cartridge assembly stop when you feel resistance otherwise you could damage a faucet if your faucet handles are working in Reverse you probably place the cartridges on the wrong sides simply take them back out and switch them now reopen the supply valves under the sink and slowly turn on your taps check for any leaks and make sure the water runs smoothly if you have any questions visit signature Hardware comm or call customer service at 186 six eight five five two two eight four thanks for watching", "ng484pwhBRI": "hello everyone today I'm going to be changing the cartridge on a Moen single handle kitchen sink with this Moen 1/2 to 5 replacement cartridge you can find these at Menards or home depot but I would highly recommend going on Amazon I saved about 5 bucks with shop shopping on there plus they have different brands that you can actually save even more but I went ahead and went with the name-brand on tools you'll need for this pretty simple Philips head screwdriver a thin bladed flat screwdriver needle nose pliers regular pliers and a 764 allen wrench and that's really all you need is pretty simple and we'll do this as quick as we can first thing you're going to want to do is go under your sink and shut your cold and hot water valves off um just make sure those are closed off test it by opening your valve on the sink and when you verified there is no water flow we can go ahead and get started with the next step which I'll show you real quick okay so I have shut the water off and as you can see nothing's coming out so we're good there the whole reason for this repair is this faucet is leaking it is not a bad leak but it's enough to where I do want to change it it stops leaking if I have it in full hot or full cold and I often don't remember so it's leaking enough to where it's a problem so we're going to go ahead and fix that first step after you shut your water off is to remove a little hot cold plug here with that in screwdriver and it just pops off pretty easily if you get it get under it and make sure you plug your sink too if you have a disposal or something like that you don't want any of these parts falling into it so make sure you plug that hole up to okay once that's off this is where you want your 564 allen key and you'll be able to see a screw in there maybe not on this video but you'll be able to see it in there when you're doing this yourself and just go ahead and stick the allen wrench in there and grab a hold of it and turn to the left counterclockwise and it's going to take several screws but it comes out easily okay that's it right there along and this top just pulls right off okay and at that point you can look down and that's where our screw is where you're going to need that Philips head screwdriver so we'll just go in and remove that and some people do this step after they remove this cover here but I'm just going to go ahead and do it right now okay my three-year-old in the back this is magnetic so hopefully it's going to pick it up there we go then this base unscrews and here's the rest of it there is a small clip right here and that just pulls out with that really with that a flathead screwdriver you can just pull that guy out and that comes off and then the whole assembly can be pulled out so this is where you want to get your pliers just grab ahold okay one thing I did forget to mention was this little ring it actually fits around this stem here just remove that before you pull the cartridge out the cartridge is probably going to be a little tight so you're going to need some decent leverage to get that thing out I ended up actually standing on my sink and then just grasping with these pliers and pulling it out so I have loosened it at this point so it's not going to be this easy more than likely but you just can pull it up and out probably get a little bit of water out of there but that is essentially the removal and we will go ahead with the install in just this minute okay and now for the installation of the new cartridge I'm you're just going to simply push it back where the other one was and make sure the orientation is the same as the old one just verify that when you're removing it it's pretty self-explanatory but you'll just want to push that guy down as hard as you can make sure it's all the way stuck down I'm actually going to pull up a little on it just a little bit on that stem and make sure that's fully extended and again you'll probably get some water seeping out of there but not a big deal so that's flush so you can see there then we'll take our little washer here or whatever the technical term is for it and put that back on the stem just like so and we'll take our clip and reinstall that just snaps right in there and we're almost done all we have to do is reinstall this base this happen okay so one thing you do in a check and this actually happened in my case but this white part in this black base that's that's a washer but they actually came out in this housing as a unit and I did not have to remove them separately so in disassembly if this comes out without these you'll just have to take those off separately real easy they just pull off this one unscrews so it's not hard at all we need to reassemble it make sure that the lip is facing forward because that's your hot and cold shutoff as you can see it has a stopper right there that stops it so that's going to control your hot and cold and stop a stop it when needed so just make sure you're doing that we can go ahead and screw this back on I will put the screw in and get this guys snug down again just make it snug not really tight doesn't need to be really tight then we can screw this base back on that just fits nicely hopefully nicely over that black piece and you can see there it's nice and flushed and again doesn't have to be super tight and at which point we will get the handle put back on can watch the hand will go back on all its glory slips down and again there's 764 allen wrench won't blind the hold up real easy we're almost finished this whole thing should take you 10 minutes as long as there's no crazy problems but there probably won't be and again should look that part on Amazon because it's way cheaper I actually went into Menards the other night and saw it for $20 and just thought that there could probably be a better price online than there was so that's what I ended up doing and just waited the two days with prime shipping not a big deal okay so you put your punch pack in make sure your water supplies turn back on which I'm doing right now and we'll make sure our necks work probably call it a day so turn on and there we go works properly ah hold good to go so uneasy fix you can do all by yourself and and it's pretty cheap don't really need any specialty tools that allen wrench is probably the hardest thing you'll have to find if you don't have a lot of tools around your house but otherwise you probably have it", "4afjfBFyyOo": "[Music] hey there youtubers I'm getting black particles coming out of my kitchen faucet for the last couple of weeks I've been cleaning on and off but it's not working so I'm gonna be replacing the moans cartridge today here are the tools that you're gonna need today before you get started make sure you turn off the hot and cold water under the sink this you will need to pry out the rubber piece here just poke in there and then pry it out I already took it out after that you've got to need a ln ranch something like this this came with the original faucet when I bought it I replaced it about seven years ago I just bought the replacement part and they included the replacement screw and the allen wrench so put it in there inside you just turn counterclockwise and I already loosened it so it's just got to come apart like this after that you gotta loosen this and this color just pops out the other tool you gotta need is I tried the Christon wrench to loosen this and it didn't want to turn and I didn't want to break the plastic so what I did was I went got my long socket this is actually for my spark plug so this is the seven eight and I use this to loosen it I already loosened it so you know pull this cap off and then this will come out I had already disassembled it you got to get a little bit of water coming out okay so over here this is the replacement part that I bought for this particular faucet and I'll include the this faucet model number on the screen this is the Moen door last one 255 replacement cartridge it comes with obviously the cartridge and the cover cap and screw and the allen wrench and some instructions looks like okay so this should be quite easy so I'm gonna reverse the disassembly steps there's notches here as you can see so you got to line up the notches and so you can't really put it in a wrong position after that I am going to screw this cap on this cover actually I'm gonna tighten this a little bit remember this is plastic so you don't want to go too tight just just go until you feel a little bit smug put this cap back on then I'm just going to use the original screw that was in there so there's also a notch on the both side there so you got to get that lined up and then tighten the screw back in okay there it's pretty tight okay now I'm gonna open up the the water line here okay okay next thing you want to do is uh you want to clean this out let here you can see all the black particles that have come out and when you take it out just push the inner piece and this will pop out and I didn't capture the part where a lot of black particles were coming out you can kind of see some of the residue here but I watched it and [Music] you can still see that a particles coming out so I happen to have one of these toothbrush it's not a toothpick it's actually a little tiny toothbrush it's kind of like a toothpick but it's done in a work form and I used this to kind of pick through here all the black particles actually had accumulated inside and when I did this oh my gosh and there was a quite a bit that came out and then I got all the side holes and then I cleaned the the outer holes here so I think it's pretty clean I've already done that I forgot to catch it on a video so I'm gonna do the final cleaning here look I just saw more black bumpers come out there oh there's more I think what happened was the Roman surround the cartridge that we're wearing here it's a lot more cutting out now there's still more in here okay I think I got most of it out I see one little black particle there so I may have to push a little bit okay I see another small piece there but he's in the loft at 99 percent better because there were a lot of black particles yeah now I don't see any so welcome you into my tea for it so anyway that's how you replace the cartridge on these Moen faucets I hope you liked the video if you did please like and I will see you next time thank you for watching [Music] [Music]", "jONk_LBALTk": "the bold look of Kohler so let's say you got the girlfriend the wife the significant out or the boyfriend something bitching at you get their trip down so not a hard job but if you never done it never done let's just say you're one of them fellows that has the douche net and skinny jeans and penny loafers or just say you're some redneck thrillbilly hillbilly that's sitting on the shooter right now drinking a Steve Weiser and like yeah you know what actually looking that faucet let's YouTube it here you go so we've got a caller first thing you wanna do is go underneath your sink and you should have some shutoff valves like so and if it's done properly left is hot right it's cold if you're looking straight on to the faucet and all that yeah alright so you take that up until you hear it snap then back it off quarter turn let's go check her out first over that she's seating good boys all right and most of these got a little can I heard there to see you at the Sun little plug there if you're not too well endowed and get yourself a small L wrench and you stick it up here like so and you find the happy spot oh look at that she came right up so you wanna put that somewhere that you knows it all these are different but this one here happens to be an Allen or hex whatever you prefer to say there we go some might be a set screw like a flat blade or Phillips or who knows so on top here you have a little bonnet deal this is just Mexi plastic so be careful when you put it back on not to break you break it then this is a real bonnet here horrible anyway and screw that bad boy remember you have the water off because if you don't at this point you will definitely know it so I'm gonna pull this little cartridge oh there she is okay side she wet alright cooler good all James snow is it James John John Michael Montgomery not as a country singer John Michael Kohler kohler wisconsin these people come to me I kind of got a little bad rap the kind of woman haters for a while they're back in the early 90s but they make everything the biggest thing is probably plumbing but they make cabinetry furniture mortars generators and the old Hillbillies out there remember your John Deere John excuse me John queers on Moore's like the 317 model at Kohler motors and be more on the side of the hill and the ditch should smoke them to the ground Amata oil this part here off Amazon they're about 15 bucks or whatever there's an update to this number we can see that the one oh one six eight one four was superseded by a GP one oh one six five one five common knowledge right there but back to cooler yeah they made everything lawn mowers generators all kinds of and kohler wisconsin family-owned company been in business since the 18 Simpsons like 140 some years and now they mostly make plumbing stuff so this is a super easy job I by no means and my turd herder fitter sewer surgeon I can't think of any other name sir sir plumbers at the moment we'll leave that loose in case she does like oh I got so excited in the forgot the most important part so anything you're working with this ship of rubber back up a little bit here all right we got rubber right well Robert is an amazing seal works great so it doesn't need to be tight way better than pipe threads here's a little tip you don't have silicone plumbers grease a little butter will do you yeah you can stick your finger in there but really don't want to be that big of a Neanderthal just a little bit of butter st. working very good with one hand that's for sure yeah there that will melt with some hot water like no problem if you look here you get two holes in the front one hole in the middle weird the two holes in the back are the liner pens Frizzle so you set it in there you can feel their up nice your excess butter that you have on your finger so stir that on the threads they're totally food safe right unless you're vegan then I don't know what you want to use me KY jelly a struggle I like Astroglide better KY is so 'yes so put that on there this year I mean it doesn't need to be tight at all the tighter you go on us the more resistance you're gonna have on this so good comeback surfing so safe it the water toy see happens huh all right back down below no you got it do it in this order otherwise nothing will happen it doesn't matter which one you turn on first that little piece of Mexico and return back number there's probably gonna be some residual on this from a beacon before [Music] yeah I'm about 2,000 percent sure that's gonna take care of her very nice put that doodad back on your anything an Allen wrench stick her in the hall stick her in the hall and the hall there you go tighten it up take you it strip out that's be good the whole thing I told you that to lose put that back in there but the hardest thing I this whole deal is if it's a design like this use a small allen come back underneath and pop that up and hope it falls down garbage disposal and if that happens make sure you turn it on with water before you subtract alright be safe good luck", "_CDBc0A_9MU": "hey guys triple inator here today I want to do a video on how to replace a delta cartridge out of a delta lyndon a single handle pull out kitchen sink faucet so the first thing you need to do is make sure that you turn off the water but shutting off the Engel stops once you get the Engel stops off there's a set screw on the handle here right behind in this little pullout cover and to get that out you'll need to use something like a knife or something sharp to get in there and pull it out little a hot and cold indicator yeah okay once you get that out there's an Allen Allen screw behind that so you guys can see right here then you'll just take an Allen set and unscrew it and the handle just pops slides right off of the cartridge here as you can see right here on the handle we'll just slide right off of this and then as you can see this little notch that's where the Sanskrit goes okay so once once you get that off this top X cushon this this is a left here this unscrews just like that and then you got this brass piece that's holding in the cartridge still so there's here's the cartridge okay so I want to loosen it up but take a pair of channellocks here and just turn it just unscrew it and this brass sleeve will come out and then the cartridge pops out now when you're going to set it back in place you'll notice that there's some little notches in there and that's that's how you know where the cartridge sets the the notches are at the front of the cartridge and that's and the cards will just sits right down in place just like that and you want to make sure when you go to screw this back in that the cartridge doesn't move out of those little notches and you just you know you just put your hand on it and hold it a little bit way you screw that screw this brass piece down on top of it and that's it so you got the cartridge out okay and I'm gonna open up the new cartridge the cartridge part is that RP 55 8 7 2 Delta kitchen-sink cartridge our p50 587 while I put these in there I'll tell you okay so the new cartridge and then if you push this little top this little button over it actually keeps the faucet from scolding it's like a skull device so just want to leave that where it is so you can push it all the way over to the hot side with this pushed over you can't can't take it to the hot side so you'd probably you probably just get warm water out of it come let's push that back over okay now it's free okay so okay so I got the cartridge back in sitting right on the right on the nut and little notches there for it and you'll want to sit in you want to make sure this spout didn't set it up the spot on the way okay you want to turn it down good type okay you want to screw this up trim it's a nut actually it's a trim though so screw this back down just like so put the and then the handle actually has a little slot for where it slides down on the cartridge just like that make sure that the handle stays in the center just like that okay and then you put this little hot and cold indicator back in place with that with the red on the left because the hot is always on them always on the left and cold as always on the right just like so then you just push it in place and that's that Wendall's get in tight then you go I mean you turn these valves back on your angle stops we test wallah and that's how you replace a delta single handle pull out every kitchen sink faucet this faucet in particular is a linden but dumb all all single handle like this it is the same method with the Delta pretty much the same method so should shouldn't be much difference so that's it that's a as how you replace the Delta cartridge for the kitchen sink faucet don't forget to hit that like button if I've actually helped you guys rate and subscribe to me I appreciate all that really do and until next time see ya", "bVJAXUpddrg": "my Moen kitchen faucet is leaking and I am going to replace the cartridge to fix the problem if you were original owner of your Moen faucet it has a lifetime warranty and you just need to contact Moen and they'll send you the replacement parts for free to determine if it was the hot or the cold side that was leaking I turned off the hot water first and it's not leaking so I knew that it is the cartridge on the hot side that I need to replace the next step is to turn off all the water both the hot and cold after I turned off the hot and cold water I opened both of the taps to make sure that my gate valves aren't leaking you need to remove the faucet handle if you think a small screwdriver you can just pop this little cap off and then using a Philips screwdriver just turn counterclockwise remove the handle remove the cartridge nut with a large wrench remove the cartridge I got a very small screwdriver and there's a little tab over on this side of the cartridge and I turned it to start to pop up the cartridge and then I got a wider blade screwdriver and pop the cartridge out I cleaned up the faucet area and the faucet handle with some lemon juice to remove any mineral deposits I have my new cartridge which I'm going to line up the little tab with the tab and push down reinstall the cartridge nut reinstall the handle you pop the cap back on and we'll turn the water back on if you have gate valves like I do in an older home when you turn the water back on sometimes you'll get a leak at the stem of the valve and if you do you should be able to give this nut a turn and the leak will stop the waters back on we have no leaks and that completes the repair of this Moen model 87 for 1/3 to handle kitchen sink faucet thanks for watching", "mH_sqcizpJ0": "hello everybody I hope you're doing great today my Delta kitchen faucet is dripping and I need to fix it so I've identified what's wrong with it and it's a cartridge so today I'm going to go over how to identify the correct cartridge then find out if you can obtain one for free under warranty and finally I'll show you how I we placed the cartridge and identified a failure so let's get started first as you can see in this website Delta's website that's for a single handled cartridge there are four options all four of these are very different so which one do I need to get the easy way to figure it out is let's go to their shop repair parts site and Endocyte of course you can go here search for them although a part number but if you're like me and I did not know what my model number is for my faucet you can just go to their interactive site and down select to your faucet so mine is a kitchen when you click on it it then goes down here then it's a faucet and sink faucets it's a one lever does it have as electric electronic no yes and no and there we go and here's the installation manual so what's good about it is that you can see how it was installed if you have any questions about that if you have to take things apart which is very handy here is the dimension diagram it's not too useful but still it's pretty neat and finally this is what really matters the assembly drawing in part illustration so as you can see my faucets the cartridge which they call valve assembly is the RP 505 87 then there's a bonnet on top of it and a cap and a handle and here's a set screw so I can see exactly how to take this apart and identify the right cartridge finally if you go to their warranty site all you have to do is just call it a 1-800 number right here and I didn't know if mine was under warranty I called him I gave them the model number and they told me that mine is has a lifetime warranty on the cartridge and they just shipped me and sent me a brand new one so the folks were really nice it doesn't never hurt it never hurts to ask and it only took me about less than 10 minutes from beginning to end talking to the nice folks at Delta now if yours isn't under warranty and of course you can go to your local hardware store and for me I found that Amazon was the cheaper deal out of all of the options in my local area so with that all being said let's now go and work on the faucet so as you can see that the faucet is dripping water quite but and you can see this is very loose the first thing you need to do is turn off the supply to the hot and cold water supply to the faucet and you just underneath the sink okay let's turn off the valve let's put a cap to cover up the sink because if anything drops you too want to drop down into a sink next let's take off the logo right here at a button right here you can use a flathead screwdriver or for me I'm going to use a utility knife all right there you go put it over here all right now there is a set screw and we need to remove the set screw for mine it happens to be I need to use an Allen wrench 1/8 standard no you don't have to take the entire screw out you just have to loosen it enough that it comes loose put that right there all right next you can see right here there is a cap and you can remove the cap counterclockwise now let's remove the bonnet with a adjustable wrench also counterclockwise and remember to hold on to the faucet so that's you know end up twisting your faucet after we remove the bonnet now we're at the actual valve right here if you don't know the model number of your faucet now you can look up this valve and find the correct one there is mine brand new from Delta when you take it out of course pay attention to the orientation for a lot of these valves there's only one direction to put it back in and one change the angle real quick so you can see there are two tubs right there that needs to match up with that there's only one way to put it in let's put this in reverse the whole step let's put the bonnet back back in so according to the instructions they say that if you happen to have a torque wrench that needs to be between 70 to 100 inch pounds for me I don't have such I don't have a torque wrench so after I hand tighten it I'm just going to do one full turn this orange little button right here this is optional this is two sets the handle limit stop so all the way to left is the factory default means it has a full range motion you can go all code and all hearts if you push it all the way to the right side position - then it allows you of a half of the normal handle movements alright next let's put the cap back on and the cap is just for decoration so don't worry too much just hand tighten it now we can put the lever on and tighten it up with an allen wrench all right so after you put the handle back on now you can put the button the logo back on and you just push it all the way down there we go okay let's see if it works and that's how you replace a Delta Faucet valve I just want to show that when you push the position from one to two there's a red bracket that comes over and it limits the movement as you can tell hey let's just go ahead and open it up I'm curious what's inside so that was a quite an easy pop out and when I lift it open so as you can see I don't know if that's clear or not I mean over time the movement just deteriorates this white thin gasket the rest is fine oh yeah this bottom part looks like there's some type of grease but no maybe so this bottom part is fine this cover is fine but this thin piece of gasket is worn out you", "UrJJjwEnSeI": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today I'm bringing you guys a video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell you our be master battery you buy one of those you're gonna fire 99% of what's out there the way that we designed it check out the separate video we did on that our minimax original with the smart chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything that you give it both these tanks three temperatures both have preheat functions easily charge work awesome with all these tanks minimax your definite go to so you buy one of these three batteries you can rest assured that basically whatever you pick up at the dispensary you're gonna be all fired so for this and several other cool videos make sure you subscribe to our channel make sure if I miss anything drop it in the comments

ahead and hit your preheat button two two clicks it'll do a 15 second preheat which will begin warming the cartridge okay what you're going to do is clear the coil by blowing through it we have to get it warm first so after the preheat completes hold your button down for five to ten seconds okay now blow through your cartridge let it cool off for just a second or two now you should be able to take a hit awesome thanks dire you're welcome have a good day you too", "qvv7PvVPbqE": "alright guys we are back and we have a new review a new product and that product is vape meds line of cartridges co2 extracted oil right here this is Key Lime Pie one of the strains that I've really been really been dying to try so when I saw this available I went ahead and picked it up cannabis club a Las Vegas cannabis club Las Vegas cannabis family you can see these things joey dabs he's the one coming up with them right now this one's a hybrid 70% indica 30% sativa some of the specs on the back here as you can see very very professional people what we have here 87% p8c tested all right and it is a half gram cartridge and it is a dis oolitic co2 extracted cannabis oil very very high quality let me go ahead and show you the cartridge itself very pretty pretty pretty golden cartridge golden oil and we're going to go ahead and take it out and we're going to give this bad boy a whirl my my cart maya my batteries are all charged up cars them yesterday when I picked up this thing I got the I'm gonna put this down for a second don't worry screwing in the cartridge while the point said my closet all right here we go we have it screwed on here nice and good I have it set on a three point eight is where I like mine set voltage wise and like I said we're going to go over again key lime pie is the strain bait met is the manufacturer Joey dad's is the one you want to hit up let's try it out oh yeah oh oh man oh that hit like a DAB Oh has that definitely that distillate co2 taste words where the flavors not strong but it rests in the back of your throat and it's like a sweet taste has a limey sweetness to it like a salary sweetness it's just very very good it's very good I was a good hit it's a very quality cartridge I would say hit wise I would give it a say man I want to give that like a nine point two nine point three maybe even yes yeah no you know what I'm going to say yeah nine point three we're going nine point three and cartridge wives very good it's a solid solid like like put together very nice the price is good the price is nice you get it delivered if you need to to the local so that's very very good look if you're like you know if you can't get out you know maybe you know maybe have some sort of a condition that doesn't allow you to move around but you still need your medication you can go ahead and get you can get that delivered to you really really awesome I guess it does have a good flavor it's really really good flavor-wise I get I mean to dis lit so I'm a giver like a like a nine I mean with this lit because they are you know they're more reintroducing the terpenes after they extract the oil it's always going to be a fainter kind of lighter taste but like what you like like you might not have that strong earthy green taste but you get like a much more concentrated of THC level and a bigger hit you know so at least that's you know the tale of the tape as we speak and something is really really good like I said for the price it's a really great deal um I don't really know if there's much more to say like I said yeah I want to say that's uh that's the ticket honor she's uh they've got more more they've got tons more flavors like I saw Apple Jacks there was a lemon cake which is one I'm going to pick up for sure they also had like man I forget I forget all the other ones but they look really really good like really really good so like and I'm going to try them out you should try them out because the oils good it hits like a champ tastes good and and it's all like put together really nice I've checked out vape meds they're [ __ ] good quality people doing good quality work so hit him up stay medicated stay blazed and if you feel like this video helped you out go ahead and like subscribe comment let me know that I'm helping you out you stay high stay medicated have a good one", "ZWB0DQOymKE": "hey what's up y'all this function astonished Club here with another video for you guys and today we got another cartridge video and today we have the reserve its from open vapes and here's what it looks like so here's the packaging it has the lab tested right here that's the side looks pretty solid pretty solid so says strand-specific distilled cartridges this is a hybrid mimosa ninety one point twenty seven percent THC CBD point twenty not bad this is a half gram they did have full brands I don't mind I'm be started half grams I never even seen I heard his brand the guy who I was telling me I don't know a pretty new project that they got so I was like why not it was pretty reasonable price to for the half gram so I was like why not today [Applause] pretty sweet California official I said this on I like the mouthpiece the circle mouthpieces those are pretty cool not bad not bad I see if she's smoking Mike and I we also got a new battery today she being cheeky I heard good things about it I know I have one let me try it try it out you know for myself you know he's not like this batteries because you can switch to voltage so that's kind of like that that's a new thing so it has three different active modes on here you could switch between and I like that because with this you can control the temperature the oil we're not burning as fast or compared to ones that doesn't have the voltage change so that is a plus and a good thing and you can still preheated so it's pretty cool I like it and it's kind of orange just like the box comes with the charger in Aries will trip HP's I recommend it I recommend this battery especially if you need another one it's good they have different options of batteries never know never know okay she's creating right now change voltage three times rage right now perfect let's see what she's smoking like the reserved emotional hi Priya nice full smoke ID like that mmm tastes not bad it's not bad it's getting the job done but yeah my bad I've had better ones I can say that but this one is not bad it's gonna maybe it was a starter one you're just getting to the cartridges or if you're looking for one on a budget I would definitely recommend this one this reserve not bad not bad once he hit to his Delta battery not bad I feel a change preheating but like I was saying against a job done I recommended and there it is ladies and gentlemen the reserved llamosa where's the box it is Bingham have a good weekend thank y'all for watching", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention for some time here on wheats and that is the fine folks over at legion of bloom legion of bloom yes legion of bloon they make all kinds of different 5 10 um thread vape pot or carts as well as i think they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back we've got their lab testing results uh showing it coming in at if it'll focus uh 78 and thc uh and then as everybody's gonna want to know this comes in at 45 for a 1 gram but it'll never focus terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a a strain that i'm not a huge strained guy but one that i do tend to like um and let's go ahead i'm a big fan of uh and by a big fan i mean i usually hate reading these sort of uh overly flowery uh pros that they these companies include on their packaging to sell you on them so let's let's lead you a little bit of the legion of bloom's story here legion of bloon is a coalition of eco-conscious cultivators with a deep reverence for the cannabis plant we carefully select terpene-rich genetics and capture their essence through solventless extraction methods combined with triple refined cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "O2-sj6JMW2Y": "[Music] [Music] oh [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] um [Music] you", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on using your 510 cartridges

here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys

to popular demand we are back with the dinosaurs will and Ralph we're going to start calling this the Dino series and will and Ralph want to kind of tell you some helpful hints around the home especially a new home and we're going to kind of think of things and talk about things that you might experience in a new home and new construction in the first year or two or three that you're living in it so today Ralph here had an idea that he wanted to talk about and bring to your attention it has to do here in the kitchen matter of fact Ralph's want to talk to you about the kitchen faucet so how many of you have bought a new home moved in and within you know a month or two or maybe a few months or so you notice all of a sudden the pressure that I had at the beginning when a person moved in at my sink has just kind of turned into this little drizzle it's a little bit deflating isn't it well we're going to show you quickly how to take care of it if you have experienced that then what you're going to need to do is pull out your faucet trick of the trade helpful hint grab a pin or a pencil or something to shove up in here so the counter balance doesn't pull this line back up in through the faucet and down into the bottom where you have to fish it back out after you detach the head or the nozzle here so what has happened is in new construction you have new plumbing lines that are put into the home and oftentimes there's dirt and stuff in a new development that gets in those lines during construction and the first few days and months as water runs to those lines it's going to flush out sound little maybe some small sand or some dirt or some mud that gets in that line and where does all that wind up well it winds up right here in the head of this faucet and it will slow it down they can do it it to your bathroom faucets and your kitchen sink mostly your kitchen sink because you're going to tend to use this over all more than you do in your bathrooms and the bathrooms just when you're getting ready brushing your teeth but think about how often you turn on your kitchen sink faucet so if you've experienced that low-pressure just to show you again you can kind of see it's a little deflating it's not much pressure at all it's about the size of a pencil stream and it just not pressurize at all pull the nozzle out put your pencil in here so you don't lose your line and then right here you're gonna see a connector it's going to be threaded so just like you don't screw screw just unscrew that and it's going to pop out and then inside here it's going to be your head bring this up here for you to see and oh yep if you look in there see if I can make that work for you if you look in there you might be able to see some of the dirt and stuff that's in laying up in there blocking is a little screen in there and it's it's a filter and it has caught all that mud dirt and sand in there so what you want to do is just turn this back one kind of low fill this out kind of wash it out tap it on the bottom of the sink look in there make sure you got it good and clean and then just want to screw that right back on the exact same way you took it off make sure this parts clean this will stuff it in there screw it down and turn it on and now you have a fully functional operational high pressurized kitchen sink faucet again guys have you found this helpful leave a comment below if you have an idea for other things that maybe happened around your home let us know that's what we do this is what we are we are a specialist in home building Ralph's and will come out with some great ideas to talk about but this one all goes to Ralph so thank you later but this is your dinosaur video Donnell days and your download series will come back with more later take care", "_vGVnBIqGV8": "[Music] hey guys Phil here from got vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them

the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ]

one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you

I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't

don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody

out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a club bro then it's you should be fine you know just don't abuse it that's it it's gonna be zit

oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to

cartridges so that you have a good idea of what you're getting into next time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor

mad at roughhouse to use welcome to Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm use the code rough 2 to get a free gift and

here in this video i'll be showing you another method on how to salvage the extra oil over your used vape carts pods and containers the first step is to get some isopropyl alcohol and clean the outsides of each pod and cartridge to make sure there are no contaminants or bacteria here i have my lovely assistant cleaning each of them and tossing them into a beaker be sure to remove any bits of silicone or plastic as they may be dissolved in alcohol in a later step once all the pods and containers are wiped off and cleaned a high proof alcohol was poured into each container to sit for a bit then i poured some high proof alcohol into the beaker as well it is important that you do not use isopropyl alcohol for this step isopropyl alcohol should never be used in any edible or vaped or any cannabis product it is only used for cleaning for each of the jars that really had some concentrate stuck to them i gave them each a quick scratching with a glass stir rod before pouring them into the beaker as well i then used the rod to stir the beaker's contents then i placed it onto a hot plate at a low heat to help the alcohol dissolve all the thc that it can after stirring and heating for about 10 minutes i strained the liquid through a coffee filter i then poured the solution into a larger flask to begin evaporating the alcohol this took quite some time to accomplish i could have collected the vapors but my water pump was broken so i had to let them just go into the fume hood be extremely careful whenever you are evaporating alcohol such as this as the vapors are highly combustible and may explode if not properly ventilated please don't try to do anything with explosive vapors such as this unless you are aware of the dangers and have the appropriate safety gear as the alcohol content lowers and the water content rises you can see some thc starting to separate out of the solution entirely it also started to get pretty cloudy this is due to the high water content compared to alcohol content i transferred to a beaker at this point as i wanted to ensure ease of collection once i started to boil down to a concentrate i would have initially done this in the beaker but the reason i used the flask in the first place is to try and capture the evaporating alcohol however my pump wasn't working and i didn't realize that at the time i took some extra alcohol and swished it around the flask to get out all of the concentrate as i poured it back in you can see that the white cloudiness disappears as the alcohol content rises compared to the water content i proceeded to continue evaporating the solution in the beaker until there was about 20 milliliters or so left i then poured what remained into a small glass jar and set up a little rig so that i could use a heat gun to remove the concentrate that was stuck to the beaker i then poured some alcohol into the beaker and scratched it with a glass stir rod to ensure i collected everything in the glass jar i placed the jar onto a hot plate and let it stir for a bit at low heat before letting it settle for a while so i could remove the water with a syringe the water is cloudy because of the uzu effect when the water to alcohol ratio is too high certain oils are no longer soluble and they come over the solution in the form of micro droplets that make the solution look cloudy like this one of the most important steps when dealing with concentrates and solvents is to ensure you do a proper vacuum purge here i'm using a vacuum pump i made in a previous video along with some rubber adapters to use the jar itself as a vacuum chamber this allows me to heat the concentrate more easily and also ensures a more effective vacuum as there is less total volume but using a regular vacuum chamber would also be fine after that i was left with a nice clear amber oil i poured it out onto parchment paper and used a heat gun to get it all over the jar after letting it cool down it had a nice consistency like shatter as you can see here alright thanks for watching feel free to check out my other videos and if you want to help support the channel you can check out patreon or click the join

procrastinating i i've had this phone now for a little bit over two weeks this is the motorola one five g ace as you guys can see right here you can tell i'm traveling by my beautiful luxurious don't worry about that um so what can i say about this phone like right off the top is it is it worth the money this one um i actually picked it up through google fi it was 279 bucks 5g unlocked now for me had it been more of you know i could activate it via esim and then have a regular sim like it'd be better but when you can pick up right now at t-mobile uh you can pick up a pixel 4a 5g which is probably going to get updates faster than this in my opinion has a better camera and arguably a better display for 350 and this is 280 it's like you just spend a little bit more money and you get the better product that's just my opinion now does the phone suck um you know it's it's i will give motorola credit for a couple things they are making 5g phones affordable right they have made it where you know and oneplus was already doing that with the nord series at metro and t-mobile so this is nothing new but you know to look at this and see you see to look at this and see like the display is fairly decent we're gonna get into like specifics on the phone here in just a minute like the display is fairly decent um it it's it's fairly responsive it's fairly responsive but there's so many there's so many other phones at this price point that just do it better and i don't want to rag completely on the cameras and stuff on this but jesus christ they're horrible um for me and i know for everybody else on youtube it's all about photos and how good of a camera can take a picture of a phone like that you know can take pictures with a phone like this but for me it's about video and with the automotive channel and the the um aeronautical channel and and the finance all the other youtube channels that i run here on youtube when i'm out and about if my sony dies you know if my a7 iii dies then i go to the iphone or to or to the s21 ultra or whatever my phone of choice is now it's not fair for me to compare this phone to say an s21 ultra no i agree 100 but when you make the big thing about your big 48 megapixel quad camera setup on the rear and you put all of these settings in here where this thing is supposed to be a monster and you know it's supposed to do let's see here yeah it only it will do 4k in 30. if you go to 60 it only does it in 1080p what that's okay for a cheap phone um but it was you know you have all of these different settings and stuff where you think you're getting a camera that's going to be super capable or a super decent uh phone right well i mean as a phone because it is motorola let me just get to that too as a physical phone um i will say as far as dialing and making an everyday phone call and holding it to the audio and stuff if you use it just to make a phone if you're using it just to make text messages and stuff this is a good phone just like anything else if you're using it to be a smart or you're using it because you want to like have entry level and decent content creation don't buy this phone the camera is uh uh uh i can't even say it's passable to say best i'm just oh oh all right uh fingerprint sensor it's okay it works sometime yeah i think lg has the best back mounted fingerprint sensor but that's just me um and again recovering back over onto the display let me turn the camera around and show you what i'm talking about all right so just taking a look at the display on this it's decent like i said it's it's definitely passable okay you can you can all and it's also definitely passable for you to get a decent uh you can get decent photos decent um decent photos decent video and like i said for the everyday like for your grandma for your kid that's like 12 years old and then you want to get them a nice smart phone then get them one that's fine but for the average everyday american or not even american just the average everyday person because you could pick this up in other countries too is this thing worth it for what you can get for the same money elsewhere and i have to say nah i mean it just it feels cheap the fingerprint thing is a little nuts it does drive me a little crazy all right the cameras are not great the display is good it's okay it's not bad but for other phones that you can get in this price point this freaking screen sucks okay now here's why i give i give motorola some credit right you know it does it does what it's supposed to do like i said it's just it's a decent phone for the money uh it's not but for what people i saw the people posting reviews on this phone it was like this is a great phone if you're starting out and you want to do content creation the camera on this let me just say as an old phrase that we have here it is guarantee i can tell you right now it's not porn ready man it's just not it's just not porn ready but anyways just a first impressions video for me on this you guys were asking me about it i'm about to go to the track you see my lid right here time for me to go racing but um look man in my opinion there's better phones at the price point like i said earlier in the video the pixel 4a you can get for 350 right now 3 5g the 5g version the big boy 350 bucks right now if you have a lovely phone laying around or here's a little network hack idea um you know look if you're gonna use it on another network say it's like metropcs or something like that anyway or qriket for example you can go get a free iphone se on cricut or maybe it's like 99 bucks um and then you get your plan and do your thing you can trade that phone in and it will eat up 180 bucks of that 350 at t-mobile um or you know like there's there's ways to make moves where you can even get that pixel 485 g for cheaper than you can buy this phone that's all i'm saying um y'all can figure out the scum baggery i'm just giving you an idea but yeah man like i said it's not it's not a bad phone i just can't say spend your 280 bucks on this because there's way too many other good options on the market that said um if you liked today's video let me know by smashing the thumbs up button you know i said i was going to get more away from doing tech stuff over here and doing other stuff and um we might do that i might migrate my tech stuff over somewhere else we'll see that's a whole nother conversation but um you guys asked me about it i bought it i checked it out i actually used it with my sim card in it for two weeks and um it sucks so now i know someone just said tk motorola is never gonna send you anything i don't care i don't care i don't care nobody sends me nothing i buy my own stuff i buy all my phones so i don't care i'm giving you an honest opinion so if anything that should let you know up front i definitely didn't get this for free and i wasn't tickling somebody's ball sack to get this phone and i wouldn't recommend you do that anyway anyways with that said have a wonderful day hope you enjoyed the video catch y'all in our next one", "_OwF_fFL4V8": "[Music] okay so here's a little video on how to change the water filter underneath the kitchen sink so here's the water filter and I'm gonna say to make things simple don't worry about these these shut off the water from the filter to the spicket and to the fridge worry about these these shut off the water coming in to everything so this is cold that's hot I would just go ahead and turn both of them off which means turning it one quarter turn clockwise to the right and then make sure check your sink to make sure that nothing's coming here nothing's coming here okay so these are off no water coming then you're gonna take your plastic wrench slide it up here and start with it to the right and rotate it to the left and if you can use one hand here and another hand up here to stabilize it to hold the top steady and then one hand to pull toward the left that's going to unscrew it and then you probably want to have a bowl underneath here to catch any water that might spill because the water level is gonna be quite high in here just a low bowl to catch any spills and then take the whole unit out dump everything out clean out this but don't use this sink to clean out this I would suggest going to the bathroom and cleaning this out so that you don't have to worry about turning the water back on okay and then when you put your new filter in you're gonna just drop the new filter in here and then by hand line this up screwed up you might have to jiggle it back and forth a little bit to get the water filter to line up with the hole on top so jiggle it a little bit if you're not screwed all the way up to the top and then finish the gram to the top use your edge again and crank it to the to the right from left to right that's going to tighten it and then turn your water back on over here so vertical on both sides and we are all set is to run your water filter for a few minutes before using of the water go ahead and run this for a couple of minutes I don't remember because I got rid of the packaging on the sucker but it says how long you run it before you start again [Music] you", "ajCmAbusdHw": "hey guys what's up its Keith Ville here with the CVD stored comm so what I want to show you today is how to take those old cartridges and basically just refill them okay so it's pretty simple now there's a few different cartridges out there so this one here let me just move my mic out of the way but this one here what you do is you just simply unscrew the top okay if you can see that so now what you do is there's a little rubber piece here and you're gonna pull that out and you just want to make sure that you don't lose this little rubber piece say see the hole at the top okay so now what you do is you just take your refill container and there's a mail that will just go right into the female there of the cartridge once you fill it up all three quarters of the way or you know just below the top just put that little rubber piece back in let's screw that on hand tight like that and there you go and you can refill these cartridges right now there's different ones there's also um this is a thicker 350 milligram CBD oil so this one here screws off as well but it basically the top doesn't screw it off it screws off on the bottom so on this one you're gonna fill this up to the line max okay because when you put this back in what this is going to do is gonna push that oil all the way to the top so if you fill that glass all the way to the top and you put that plunger back in you're going to I'm spill the oil all over the place okay so this is what it looks like when you have it unscrewed okay this is the other part of the cartridge okay this is the mouthpiece and you're just gonna put that back in like that and screw that in so these are great when you buy a few of these what you can do is just refill them okay so you don't have to throw these out and a lot of folks don't know that so again you just unscrew this here and again you see that plunger now you could actually clean this out if you have a particular flavor in here that you know you could actually just clean that out with a a simple brush to get all that out of there or just rinse it out with some hot water but that's it you just put that together like that and not many people realize that you can filled with cartridges pump okay guys so that's it hey this is Keith with the cvd store look for some more videos guides we've got some great new products we've got the um some bee's knees 1000 I'm sorry 1200 and 3,000 added to the site those are on force we have our new 1000 milligram vape oil that is on the site that's in 12 different flavors so check us out guys CBDs store.com and look for some more videos coming your way pretty soon thanks", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "ZarvcmhxBSI": "hello everyone and welcome to another product video brought to you by cheapest vape supplies calm we specialize in all cannabis vape

filter cartridges and the first thing we're going to show you how to do is actually switch off your cold water underneath your sink there are possibly two ways in which you might have to do this the first one will be your valve which is a ball valve which is actually a lever that you can see under the sink here just run pull that lever towards you and that will shut off the water for you or alternatively you might have a quarter-turn fitting which just needs a bit of a turn to the right and that's another way you can actually shut that off also once you've shut off your water what you need to do is drain the lines from your water filter tab so switch on your water tap and let that run until it stops running which means there's no water left in the lines now you need to get back under your sink to where your housings are your housings might actually be screwed into the wall or they could just be sitting there like these ones are now what you'll need to perform this exercises make sure you've got a bucket handy and perhaps a towel underneath your housings just to catch any water that might be caught inside the housings itself now remove your housings from underneath your sink we've actually got enough John guest tubing here that we can pull them out and set them in a bucket if you don't have that luxury then you might have to do it perform this exercise actually underneath your sink so grab the housings you're using the housing spanner just loosen off the housings and then you should be able to remove those just with your hands alone so remember keeping it over the bucket because there will be water caught caught inside those housings so once they're detached and empty out the excess water and you can remove your filter cartridge okay now we've actually got a new system here so ours are quite clean but you might find that after 12 months yours might have a bit of grime or inside them which can just easily be cleaned with a bit of hot water if you do clean it what you need to remember is with your o-rings is get some food grade safe lubricant and just use that around the actual earrings themselves just to lubricate inside those okay so once that's done grab your new cartridges and simply reverse the action put them back in making sure that your carbon cartridge goes on the side where it says out on the top screw that up let's tighten it as much as you can with your hand then grab your housing spanner and just give it a bit more of a tighten okay now you need to your sediment filter once again putting it back inside the housing and screwing it to the top and again - ekang that the sediment filter is on the right side of the housing where it says in on the top of it okay so that's how you replace your water filter cartridges that's from clear choice water filters if you have any inquiries feel free to call us on 1300 Comi you thank you", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well

under 2 minutes without removing them from vendor-supplied foam blocks we'll show you how in the demo for now let's do the math 50 carts in 2 minutes 1500 carts an hour 12,000 filled cartridges in a single eight-hour day from single a 10 hotshot system reason to control and precision fill any volume cart from point 3 3 grams to one full gram with total volume control in point 0 1 gram increments point zero 1 reason 3 flexibility use our Hot Shot 1500 to fill any oil viscosity use it to swap out batches mid-run use it to quickly and precisely fill almost any style vape cart pen or syringe speed precision flexibility you're 100 percent card filling solution our new 810 hotshot systems are available in two models and both are detailed at hotshot cool jars comm check them out right now however there's a lot to know about the new a 10 and you probably have some questions so here's an in-depth up-close very detailed look how to put our new hotshot to work let's start with system setup this is the super speed 810 hotshot 1500 the fastest of the two models cool jars offers it weighs around 15 pounds and takes up about 2 square feet of table space just make sure it's on a stable level surface to start find the 16 ounce bottle of blue heat transfer fluid and pour the entire contents into the blue reservoir now slide the Innova stainless-steel immersion heating element into the reservoir twisting slightly to make sure it's fully seated positioned correctly you'll see three dimples level with the top of a reservoir next mount our black nonstick oil tank onto the a10 to ensure proper connection align this white cam with the slot in the a10 press down firmly until seated then turn clockwise to lock in place here's something that will interest you our oil tanks features self sealing one-way check valve so you can swap out tanks and batches mid run to remove the tank turn counterclockwise to unlock then pull straight up model 1500 comes with two oil tanks and you can order additional tanks as an option more about swapping tanks later next install an a-10 oil injection needle our component kit contains needles of varying sizes which gives you options to fit style cards your filling we suggest you select the shortest length you can to lessen pressure on internal piston assembly and thread the needle into port and use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit to tighten being careful not to over tighten now install your selected fill switch in our high-performance model 1502 options are available our new button activated speed tray plus our foot activated fill pedal both options plug into the USB port on the left front side of the a10 we'll use our new speed tray for purposes of this demonstration next connect power source plug the round mail and the power transformer into the rear of the a10 control box now plug the transformer and the Innova heating element into a switched power surge strip that's rated for at least 10 amps that's it for system setup let's talk about operation first activate the a-10 system by powering up the surge strip now power up the Innova heating element by pressing the red button on front of the display panel the button will display white when activated quick note press and hold this button for a few seconds to switch readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius press and hold again to switch back select whichever scale you prefer now pour desired amount of batch oil into the nonstick tank it will hold any amount up to one thousand grams per tank cover with lid next adjust system operating temperature using the thumb wheel on front of the Innova display rolled up to increase roll down to decrease you can adjust the Nova in 1/2 degree increments an initial setup adjust he's set into 170 degrees Fahrenheit to fully heat the a-10 system and set the onboard heat switch this is important when the a-10 system is fully heated actual oil temperature will be anywhere from twenty to thirty degrees lower than the Innova setting depending on viscosity of oil use a heat gun to determine the actual oil temperature then adjust the Innova as necessary to reach your desired oil temperature once the a-10 system is activated the main touchscreen will light up the screen will not show operational controls until a system and oil are fully heated if attempts are made to operate system prior to heating this waiting for heater message will be displayed when operational controls appear on the touch screen the a-10 is ready for use use a test screen for all inputs first select this casa t from one of three options available on the model 1500 olive oil glycerin and honey select the option that best describes the estimated miss custody of your batch at fil temperature now select shot size from one of three options point three three grams point five grams at one gram a custom setting is also available volumes are adjustable in point zero one gram increments next select speed using the up and down arrows on the five bar graph each bar represents a 20% increase or decrease in fill speed finally select end count to input the number of fills you wish to perform once desired fill count is reached the a 10 will stop flow of oil to reset press hole to reset for a few seconds to zero out the reading with these few settings in place they're ready to go following initial setup first prime or purge 18 system by holding a container under needle and pressing fill switch several times until oil is dispensed returned priming oil to main tank so you don't waste it next test cartridge fill volume using a very precise scale weigh the container you're using to prime the system inject a shot then weigh container again the difference will be the shop volume repeat as necessary adjusting volume on touchscreen to achieve desired amount adjustments can be made in point 0 1 gram increments as an alternative volume testing procedure way an empty cart before and after filling and make any necessary adjustments once made these volumes will remain consistent throughout the batch now let's fill some cards the a-10 model 1500 features a new high volume speed tray with a button activated fill switch it is really really fast to use it cut a typical vendor-supplied 100 card foam block in half and place a 50 cart block in speed tray this lets you fill carts directly in the block instead of removing and filling one by one now position needle in corner cart inject pre-measured fill using onboard switch and move on to the next cart you will be absolutely amazed at the speed you can achieve with our new 8n hotshot with speed tray once comfortable with the process you can typically fill this tray of 50 carts and something under 2 minutes even a 2 minutes per tray that's 1,500 carts an hour and that's 12,000 carts a day if you prefer to use our foot-activated fill switch there's no need to cut a hundred cart foam block unless you prefer to fill smaller quantities so you can cap them quicker simply position the foam block under injection arm insert needle in the corner cart depress foot pedal to inject each shot and move on when you fill 50 cards on one side reverse block and Faure it could not possibly be quicker and easier incidentally flow rates will depend on a number of factors including viscosity of oil heat of oil size of carts etc you can fine-tune your fills by adjusting viscosity speed and shot size settings to achieve optimum flow rate finally we'd like to show you a few quick procedures that will keep your oil processing operation running smoothly first a quick needle change demo use the blue plastic thumb socket in the kit unscrew the needle and return the kit insert new needle tighten lightly with tool and you're good to go next a tank change if you're changing in the middle of a batch run the tank will be warm so make sure you're wearing gloves turn tank counterclockwise to unlock and pull straight up a check valve will stop the flow of oil though you may have a few residual drops to wipe up now insert a fresh tank it can be empty full or partially full twist a lock and you're ready to rock fix maybe 30 seconds since we're talking about the tank if you wish to do a total clean-out and would like to replace oring in the valve first remove tank as previously described and empty remove valve with three-quarter inch socket using six in one tool in the kit without the bit push up spring-loaded valve to reveal Oh ring remove old ring with a single edge razor blade replace the spare o-ring in the kit we install valve with socket and you're done additional earrings are available on our website if you're having problems achieving a consistent shot size it may be a partial blockage of the upper or lower valve due to oil residue here's how to replace both for the upper valve remove tank as previously demonstrated and use supplied socket drive to remove valve model 1500 comes with replacement valves so look for one in the kit screw into place tighten lightly with socket drive replace tank reprime system is described previously and continue filling procedures finally here's how to replace a lower valve remove tank as previously demonstrated using Philips screw bit on the 61 tool in your kit unscrew the 90 degree bulkhead on front of the injection arm next use the hex wrench to loosen the two screws on either side of the arm and slide injection arm straight out using the six in one tool without the screw bit carefully unscrew the lower valve reverses procedure to install that's all there is to it as mentioned early on our new cool drawers Hot Shot cart filling systems deliver the speed precision and flexibility you need to achieve optimum profitability from oil product lines and here's something else to consider if you're like most current 810 users you have at least one filling system gathering dust on your shelf because it just flat doesn't get it done enough you've tried the rest not ordered the best the all-new cool jars a

Moen faucet the leak on my faucet was coming right here from the handle and it's dripping down right here so I looked up a couple different videos and didn't see anything good and figured I would pour something to myself with the tips that I received from the comments of some of the other videos so make this short and sweet I already took this apart and it was a bit of a struggle so I'm going to try to step you through step by step on what I did to take it apart step one of working on this is going to be to turn off the water down below so we will do that right now now we have that turned off I'm going to dock the camera right there what you need here is an allen wrench and this size is three thirty-seconds and then you have to find the hole I don't know if I'll be able to see with the camera but we'll give it a shot it's right up in yeah not going to work it's underneath the handle is part of the handle and I will show that in more detail here after I get this off so you take this and take a little bit of fidgeting to get it right up into the hole but if you're going all the way deep in then you are not getting the hole right there so it's right about here turn it counterclockwise left do it it's it's already have this one taken apart I'm going to go ahead turn this on this is important part you pull the handle down and then it pulls straight off so one of the first mistakes I made was I kept unscrewing on screwing on screw on as you can see that you don't need to unscrew all the way these needs unscrew far enough to where it is down below the hole and you can then pull it off so I was screwing unscrewing for what felt about thirty minutes and then you get right up there you can see that's where it goes so there's your screw that you're heading right there and then you just need to clear down there so that's piece off we're going to go ahead and take this piece off a little housing and so I don't know any the technical names I just turn this counterclockwise and then started wiggle it off like that set it aside and then you have this little seal right there so we'll just make that sure that's on and then the ultimate fix for this which a lot of other people were experiencing with these faucets was the knot right here this guy was loose by about a quarter of a turn so I just took an adjustable wrench like this and put it right on there turned her about a quarter of a turn I didn't want to turn it too much cuz everything in here is plastic and I didn't really really they want to bust that off so turn about a quarter of a turn I could feel it really snug in there and call it good from there so now that we have that done and I verified I turn the water back on I'll do that real quick and show you yeah so I turn the water back on and I just flip this off and I let it sit down here for a few minutes and make sure that there's no leaks I will probably take safeguards and still keep something under here to catch that water and put in a sink just for a couple days just so I got these of mine that it is good so we turn the water back off now and I'll show you why that's important when we go to reassemble this you need to put this piece on first so that gaps down below and I just kind of like I said the first time spinning around a little bit but before we do that I'm going to take this back up put this like this the other thing that tripped me up was this has to be in the on position so if I take this and I'm I made sure that screw is as close as it could be without turn to the on position so then we can fit this back on and I'll show you right here okay sorry about that little video difficulties now that I was showing that we have this on the on position with the water off I'm going to go ahead and put this back back on and same thing where which kind of snugs down and then turn that so it's down the bottom hidden and now that that is down there I'm going to search around like there and I can see that it snugly fit in right there now the fun part that we are going to screw this back in once again like I said at the beginning it's a 3/32 allen wrench and I'm going to show you a couple turns here just to give you an idea of where it's Adam and turn this back to the off position so I have more clearance and then I'm going to find the hole like this and then you can see right about there that's about how far it goes in and I'm going to spin it release it and continue to do this if it goes all the way up there you're not in the right spot so right about there and you'll feel it you'll feel Yellen wrench seat in there so we're going to pause this and then I'll show you in a minimum efforts done all right we're back that took me about seven or eight minutes where I finally took this allen wrench off that was able to get there like a snug it up and now if I take this out and I try wiggling it there's no movement slides like this I like this nice now we're going to turn the water back on give her one last test and collaring day yeah hot water cold water no leak", "n-W7VONS19M": "hey how's it going I'm going to show you what a faucet cartridge is how it works and replace one in a leaky Pfister faucet I'm not a probe just a guy that likes DIY a cartridge is a replaceable water valve the faucet handle attaches to the spline stem on the top and turns the top half of the cartridge this opens a valve and allows water to flow into the inlet on the bottom and out through the outlets on the sides the water then flows to the spout and into your sink watch this video at 3 minutes and 50 seconds and I'll show you how I got this cartridge completely free with Pfister's lifetime warranty if you don't know your faucets model number they have an easy way to figure it out [Music] start by turning off the water supply under the sink hot is on the Left cold is on the right to avoid losing parts down the drain close it remove the handle by twisting only the hub counterclockwise use the wrench to turn the nut counterclockwise if your faucet assembly starts to wiggle and move like mine is the nut under the sink needs to be tightened [Music] pull the cartridge out by pulling straight up on the stem set event inside the hole can cause leaking so clean it out remove the blue or red coloured ring from the old cartridge and place it on the new one some faucets won't need the ring and can be left off reapply the nut [Music] [Music] be careful to not over tighten the nut with the wrench brass is soft and easily damaged [Music] turn the water supply back on before you reapply the handle so you can check for leaks from the cartridge place the plastic ring down first then point the handle in the off position which is straight out and to the right then twist the hub back on until it snugly makes contact with the sink surface the cartridges come in a hot water model which has a red ring on the stem and the cold water with the blue ring the difference is the direction in which the cartridge will allow the handle to turn [Music] sister has an excellent lifetime warrantee and replace my faucet handle and cartridge when my handle was difficult to turn if you have any problems call their 800 number and they will start with opening a case number for you and getting your info if you don't know your faucets model number they will email you a link to upload a photo of your faucet for Fister to identify when you click on the link it will ask you to select the picture to upload you can conveniently upload the photo directly from your phone it took about three weeks for the parts to arrive thanks for watching and if you have any questions or knowledge to share I encourage you to comment and remember if I did it you can too", "wnUT4-HbKog": "what's up guys this is Nick from disk have a pen and today we're going to tell you about the difference between using a ceramic made cartridge and a cotton wick baked cartridge [Music] alright guys so when you have your 510 threaded cartridges this guy or this guy you're gonna have two types one of them is going to be a cotton whip like this and one of them will be a ceramic heating element like this guy well they both have their advantages and disadvantages if you're trying to do a lower voltage meaning the lower power setting you want to go with the cotton cartridge they can't handle such a high voltage from the battery which would mean you know if you know especially if you have one of the ones that are adjustable where you can turn it up or down you're gonna want to keep at a minimal setting because if you put too much power into one of these guys you risk burning it out early or you know you could turn your juice dark and black because it just stresses the heating element out too much now with our other guy these ceramic these are gonna be a little more up to date where you're gonna be able to run them at a higher setting not super high but with the spinner batteries or the adjustable voltage batteries you'll definitely be able to turn it up a little higher and will give you a little more of a kick with your v the way you can tell the difference is if you look inside the barrel of this one the cotton one you can see a little cotton poking out at the top of it as opposed to the ceramic where you have kind of a cage sitting down on it onto it and you'll have some wick holes where you'll see where the juice will flow in both of them are gonna be 510 threaded and both are gonna be acceptable for batteries like this so you know again just to make sure if you're adjusting you're gonna want to have a ceramic type that'll let you turn your battery up a little higher we recommend a voltage no real higher than about 4 volts that should be the highest you go if he's something a little higher but take it bit by bit and then if you're using a traditional cotton cartridge that's gonna want to stay at a minimum about 3.7 volts you don't really want to turn it up much higher than that and obviously the question too is well what if my battery doesn't adjust well then you're fine for both you know that's going to run at a lower setting that'll be acceptable for both types so if you

gonna fix a leaky tap it's the Frank something so it's been doing my absolute nothing so let's get to changing it as you can see it is just dripping so we'll need to get a bit and there's a bit under here to unscrew it perhaps a bit loose anyway so I need to tighten it and make sure you plug out your sink just in case the screw comes out I think it's a TA bit underneath here we'll need to unscrew as you can see it's loose already so we'll turn the water off and try not screw it as is easy to access under the sink so we'll turn the water off make our way back up as you can see we'll just let it drain I've got my t8 bit and then they've focus as you can see that's the type of bit you'll need I recommend having something that you can reach around with hopefully I'll be able to get it so let's have a go as you can see you get the little screw back out you don't have to take it all away but I just bought bring it out to show you now we will see the cartridge when I can get that out I've got a 14 spanner and we'll take the cartridge out as you can see we've got it out we've got a take off if it can focus anyway if you guys can see it it's that ring we'll take that off don't lose it dab it off first as you can see we've got to take this bear out as well it's not looking the cleanest so hopefully clean it up and everything should be alright so we'll get this bit out should come up easy enough all right and as you can see the inside that's the way it goes so as you can see there's little groups where is so we take them out looking the cleanest so hopefully tie you that out don't look too bad at you will put it in some bicarb and white vinegar and see how it goes it don't look too bad no long scale wise I can see there is a bit day in the middle down here so hopefully I guess that and hopefully it will sort the problem so got the white vinegar or soak it in and we'll put some bicarbonate and hopefully it will solve the problem as we don't have any anti limescale stuff we decide to do the bite white vinegar and bicarbonate soda and we're going to leave it for about 20 minutes I suppose a half an hour so hopefully that will solve it so it's picked up some bits I don't know if you could see on camera run down the side here I put the title tap in there just to make sure that's all clean so now we'll stick it all back together and hopefully it should work as you can see we'll put it back together again so we'll start off with this this one goes in on the groove as you can see in there there you go and that should go the grooves either side on like Wow and just before just before we put it back just make sure when you twist it is it fully closed because sometimes that could be a problem and then we'll put this on and the seal here could be worn so there we go so oh and don't forget this little bit there you go and we'll put it back into the tap just a quick pointer will clean insider here first just to make sure there's no debris or anything in there with a sonic scrubber all I'm doing is dipping it in back in the vinegar and by Karthus over though there make sure you try and get everything so tighten back that back up that's tight there put the tap back on make sure you put on straight might be a little bit off it's too far [Music] not the easiest of angles have you got the right tool for and we'll turn the water back on and hopefully it's not dripping and there you go good job", "t5Mtbx-W0D4": "hey guys dr. Shawn Mira vici here and I'm gonna do another cannabis product review for you despite all the craziness happening in the world right now with Koba 19 I'm practicing very strict social distancing but that doesn't mean I can't keep doing product reviews for you so today we have the another vape cartridge product using the 510 thread system today is going to be the sundial Zen very also known as shish kebob and so this comes from sundial growers they're based in Alberta some things of note about this company is that they really emphasize that they're putting out pure products meaning that they're free from additives fillers and artificial flavorings so you know you're getting a really pure product they do a glass and ceramic cartridge so a very high quality cartridge and they use single strain extracts so it's kind of like a single malt scotch meaning that your extracts just coming from one strain rather than a mix of different strains a lot of the other cartridges out there are really a mix of a bunch of different strains so kind of cool that this is a single strain extract it comes in at around 72 to 82 percent THC meaning that it's very strong THC level it's available on the Ontario cannabis store retailing for about 49 actually it's exactly forty nine ninety-five putting it into sort of the middle midpoint range in terms of price for for a vape cartridge but I don't mind paying a little bit extra if I'm getting a really good quality product so let's open it up it's also got a sort of a unique box most of the other fake cartridges I've received come in this paper box this one is this plastic round container and you open up by you see those notches you match up the notches there and then you pull it open or at least you try to pull it open yeah there we go okay let's pull it out you could take a look at that looks really nice it's got their logo there a nice glass container and the tip feels really nice too so you could tell it's high-quality and that just fits into your 510 cartridge battery system you screw that in there okay and then you're ready to go one thing I also wanted to mention about this particular strain is that they're terpene profile includes cario Filene Mersin and humulin and alluding to its name they say that you're gonna get like a nice sort of berry flavor with this vapor and I agree so you'll notice like it doesn't really taste obviously like berries but there is sort of this hint of barrenness in the flavor i had previously ordered the aurora indica cartridge and that was just like really just straight-up like cannabis ii flavor this one definitely has a hint of barrenness to it so i've been using this for the past three four days not a huge long time but but I do like the vapor it's nice and smooth it's got that sort of berry finish to it it is quite strong and it's a creeper meaning that you don't really feel this one right away it sort of creeps up on you after about 10 minutes so definitely go slow with this one because it will sort of creep up the effects and they are quite strong so it is quite calming it hits Li you like in a whole body way but it's very short-lived like it only lasts 60 to 90 minutes and then you kind of feel a little sleepy afterwards so I wouldn't recommend this as a daytime strain definitely best suited for evening nighttime use and that's really what I've noticed about this product is that it's strong but the effects wear off quite quite soon after so like an hour to an hour and a half taking all of those factors into account so you know a good quality product stressing that it's added to three which you know is what I want in a vape cartridge it it's that single strain all around like a high quality product but the effects are short-lived and the price is sort of mid to high range so taking all those into consideration I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 good product a couple limitations with it but but there you have it the sundial Zen berry thanks for watching be sure to subscribe if you like this content and want to see more content like this and i'll be back with another product review for you shortly", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "Zyjec9G9B4o": "would you believe I've got a drip in my Moen faucet on top of that it's the hot water side the stem stays pretty warm no problem I called Moe and I said hey I replace this faucet about 18 months ago and it's got a drip they said what model is it I told him and I said okay is at the heart of the cold at the time I wasn't sure they said no problem we'll send you two stems free of charge yeah you believe that two of them free of charge emailed me the instructions and we're gonna install this bluebird this is a Moen 1/2 2/4 beat it works on the hot or cold side of this particular faucet I'll bet this same valve works on several different models so let's get to it they emailed the step-by-step instructions the tool lists everything you need to get this done there's also a recommendation that after you pull the valve out that you turn the water you take a toothbrush and clean down here turn the water on for a second to purge that debris out and then install the new valve not quite sure how we're gonna knock that out but we'll figure it out let's get her tools together well the first step in replacing these valves is to turn the water off I did that outside open the valves to relieve the pressure and on this particular model we're gonna remove this cap on top there's a Philips screw down in here remove that okay now we're going to use some pliers turn this nut counterclockwise and use the pliers again and just lift up on that valve on that stem right there you can't have mineral deposits built up here we did not just water that's the water that was in the neck here just found a way to go out so that's why I came out of there now we're going to use a soft bristle brush such as such as a toothbrush to get down in here and clean where the mainline you're trying to clean where these o-rings are going to be seating make sure there's some no mineral deposits built up there that would make this new cartridge leak it's only has four downs I gotta go right there okay now since I'm done myself I'm not gonna go outside and turn the water on what I'm gonna do is close this valve close the cold water side and I'm gonna blow in the faucet and hopefully blow that water out of there that'll purge all those contaminants out that worked now you're supposed to not only clean but dry this part of the faucet out before you put any cartridge in there so I'm just gonna run a paper towel down here bring it around a little bit suck up some water everything dry and they check it with a flashlight make sure it's clean okay we're going to install the new cartridge and the only trick to this is that there's a small notch plastic notch right here and it needs to fall down into the notch right here so just line your notches up okay make sure it's fully down stand all the way the notch is in the slot put the nut back on snug get it with some pliers install a handle and then put your cap on turn your water off at the faucet turn it on at this fly check for leaks call it a done deal alright the water is on we don't have any leaks and everything still works work and here in an hour so if I hear another drip you know I got another one to replace it with anyway hey hope you learned something thanks for watching these are super simple modes a great company you pay a little bit more for them when they're new but that's a lifetime warranty product lifetime forever and they sent me to when I really only need one pretty awesome thanks for watching", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and

was leaking the water was building up right in this area here and coming out underneath the handle I already had replaced the two rings and rings nylon rings in this section so I know that wasn't the problem so the next thing to do is to look at the seals under the cartridge there's three of them so I already replaced the cartridge but I wanted to show you this the three seals I almost replaced just the seals but American Standard only sells the cartridge with the seals and even though I could have gotten them from another manufacturer or dealer just the Rings I decided to try that the whole cartridge because this one has a fair amount of play in the handle mechanism and I thought maybe the new one would be better and sure enough there's no play in that so I'm gonna like that better now this this was leaking only when the water was turned on so that meant that the big ring was leaking but you could have it leaking all the time if one of these small rings which is the hot or cold water inlet no what was leaking so really all I needed was this big round ring but that's the way those it was only I I paid 10 50 for this for the replacement all assembly which is probably what a plumber would do anyways replace the whole thing now this one thing about installing these is its plastic and you can you can over tighten the screws and mush these holes and the plastic so just be careful of that this one I I tried over tightening a bit to see if I could get it to seal any better it didn't work I also tried cleaning you know the surfaces here and in there you know it just needed to be replaced so there's the new one it's installed there's no water building up in there even when I turn it on so now I'm ready to put the rest of the pieces back in it's it's pretty simple as this trim piece that goes in here and that's like that this goes on the arm there with the set screw in that slot I'd say no in order to get to that you're gonna have to have this in the on position so better to do it without the water on but I have the water on to test it and watch what happens make sure everything was good oh yeah when you take this out to you you just loosen the setscrew you don't need to take it all the way out and you definitely want to get the sets through Scott started before you put it back together cuz it's a lot easier to get it together so we're gonna put that on the air slides right down gonna have to turn it on a little bit to get up not super-tight and there you go nice nice and secure I like that it's not we moving around the way it was so there you have American Standard and it's good for another 10 years I hope 10:15 unfortunately the the leak caused a bit of corrosion around years and you know I mentioned that the American Standard nice at all you show us your receipt and well we don't have a receipt so you can't get any anyway without the receipt you", "Nfy0prr86Cc": "we're going to show you how to repair a leaking mixer tap using the blanco alta compact for our demonstration the usual reason for this is either a fault with the cartridge or seals that need replacing on new builds in particular it is possible for foreign bodies to enter the mixer tap and damage the cartridge you will need the following for the repair an allen key and a Blanco cartridge locking key and the following Blanco spare parts two body seals fitting grease and a cartridge you must turn the water off at the angle valves under the sink before changing the cartridge turn them in a clockwise direction now open the mixer tap to make sure that the water has been switched off and that there's no pressure next close the little basket strainer so that no small parts can fall into it remove the cover cap to get to the allen screw depending on your particular version you'll find this little cover which is made of plastic or the same material as your mixer tap on the front or back of your Blanco mixer tap carefully lay all the items out for instance on a towel turn the Allen screw anti-clockwise remove the mixer tap control lever and use the cartridge locking key to release the cartridge locking ring by turning it anti-clockwise remove the following in this order the faulty cartridge the mixer body and the faulty body seals thoroughly clean the inside body and insert the new body seals we recommend greasing the body seals with fitting grease put the mixer body back in place and insert the new cartridge in the mixer make sure that the drill holes are correctly positioned now tighten the cartridge locking ring again but not too tightly then replace the lever tighten the allen screw and put the cover cap back open the angle valves and the mixer tap to make sure that it is stopped leaking we support our customers and

kitchen faucet step 1 preparation before getting started turn off the hot and cold water inlets for your kitchen faucet they're usually located in the cabinet below the faucet gather the right tools for the job for safety Annie's Moen recommends using a Phillips screwdriver adjustable wrench and safety glasses step 2 mount the faucet assembly to your countertop or sink if there are three holes in your countertop or sink you'll need to install a deck plate check your product box to see if a deck plate is included with your faucet position the deck plate and it's gasket over the center mounting hole to cover the holes you don't need then insert the hoses and faucet shank into the mounting hole if there is one hole in your countertop or sink feed the hoses and faucets shank through the spout base gasket and align it to the base of the faucet then insert the entire assembly into the mounting hole make sure the handle is on your right and the spout is facing you if your countertop or sink is less than a half inch thick install the support bracket and mounting washer for added stability if it's greater than a half-inch only install the mounting washer in this video we're demonstrating a thin installation underneath your countertop or sink slide the support bracket over the hoses and faucet shank then slide the mounting washer onto the faucet shank make sure the hoses are in the curve of the washer thread the mounting nut onto the faucet shank with your fingers make sure the faucet is positioned properly tighten the mounting nut with a provided installation tool inserting a screwdriver at the end of the tool makes tightening easier notice the rough edges on the faucet shank thread the hose guide nut on the end to protect the pull-down hose from rubbing against the edges step 3 connect the water supply lines the hot supply line which has a white tag should be connected to the hot water inlet secure the connection with an adjustable wrench you want the connection to be snug but don't over-tighten now attach the cold side in the same way step 4 install the pullout hose and hose weight feed the small end of the pullout hose into the faucet spout remove the protective cap on the end of the hose then slide on the doughnut shaped weight connect the pullout hose to the faucet with our innovative dura lock Quick Connect system simply insert the hose into the connector an audible click indicates a secure connection step 5 flush the system to remove any debris make sure the faucet handle is in the off position turn the hot and cold water inlets back on position the pullout hose into the sink and turn on the faucet let the water run for about 15 seconds this will flush any dirt or debris that might be in the system step 6 attach the spray wand to the pullout hose remove the protective cover on the end of the spray wand make sure the rubber washer and screen are in place thread the spray wand onto the pullout hose tighten it with an adjustable wrench just until the hose nut is flush with the wand be careful not to over tighten the last step is cleaning up in order for the spray wand to function properly the area around the hose should be clear of any cleaning supplies or other obstacles that might inhibit hose movement congratulations your job is finished installing a pull-out kitchen faucet is fast and easy with Moen buy it for looks buy it for

for being here in my bedroom and i'm going to do another dmt trip so i said i was going to go for a big one so i think i'm just going to go for a big one and i also said i'd do my next one in the park but i don't think i want to go for a huge trip in that park so i'll do the big trip here now in my bedroom and then i'll do like a milder trip out there in the coming weeks i got some music playing but i'm gonna you know cancel it out of my video it's um carbon based life forms i don't know if you've ever listened to them but they play pretty mellow electronic music and i got the lights fairly dim as you can see and i got this really nice video for visuals that i put up on my screen in case i end up leaving my eyes open which sometimes i do and i will link that in the description if you want to check out what i was watching and i'll link the carbon based life forms album 2 which i'm listening to anyways i'll be using a dmt cartridge which don't ask me how i got it or where to get them guys i've been getting that that question a lot in the comments i don't want that stuff in my comments or not you guys i mean new viewers probably if you're new to the channel that's just keep that in mind just you know do your own research where there's a will there's a way get get resourceful i had a friend who who had the cartridges so i got lucky with that i don't really know where he got them all right so i'm not really like in a very talky make a video mood but i wanted to document my trip so uh if you don't mind i'm just gonna get to it and then if i feel like speaking about it later i will speak about it later but maybe i'll just do that tomorrow or something i just wanted to film the actual trip itself because i just wanted to trip tonight you know you get it you know what i'm trying to say so so we'll see or i might end up talking afterwards i don't know sometimes i have a trip and it's just so like intense i just sort of feel like waiting a bit like i said in my last video i lost the mouthpiece the tip just the tip i lost and um so i have to like make sure my lips go around it you know so that's why i'm hitting it funny if it looks like i'm hitting it funny and i'm gonna lie down i prefer to lie down usually sometimes i sit up but usually i'm like taking a hit or something and i got to deal with that so it's nice to have the pen i can just lie down and put it in here after i that's why i got this because because the tip is missing it will leak out if i hold it upside down so i gotta like keep it upright that's not quite small enough actually i'll put this cloth in here there we go genius such a genius okay guys thanks for watching the video i do lots of videos like this so check out my channel for more trip reports and stuff like that and um there's music and there's just you know okay boys and girls i bid you farewell is that that's that is that what they say it's an old english thing right i bid the i bid the farewell okay i think that's about it i'm ready i'm tired i find dmt is good if you're like tired and getting ready for bed if you're relaxed skip you're in a relaxed mood for sure i'm stalling i'm stalling [Applause] here we go [Music] uh [Music] huh [Music] [Music] so [Music] sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep sleep [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh my god you guys oh my god [Music] oh [Music] oh my god [Music] it was pointing at me it told me oh my god you guys [Music] the coordinates tracking my like eye movement i'm just saying this so i don't forget later sorry if it doesn't make sense the coordinates it's pointing out to me what the fuck it's trying to decide whether or not to close my eyes it's always something i struggle with and when i was doing that it felt like the trip was getting mad at me and then when i just and then i decided to leave them open and i think i was telling it was telling me like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like nothing you say or do matters really it's in control always and my god the further i get away from it the less ability i have to describe what i just saw fuck still really high i wasn't blacking out at any point but like i still can't it's like it's trying to make me forget like i saw how the universe worked there's some being that can just do whatever it wants whenever it wants it can move wherever it wants and just you know i saw different reality different universes multiverses and just oh my god maybe the details will come like what the fuck i kept saying too like i should talk about this because i'm gonna i'm gonna forget later but i'm like no no i'll remember i'll remember it all makes sense and then just every minute that goes by makes it's less and less sense but i just saw what the fuck [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] watch i wasn't recording this whole time i'm still recording thank god well that was cool i just saw the universe work to you guys and it looked like it was like okay hear me out it's not gonna make much sense but this is the best i can describe it like every universe was on like a string and it was like sort of moving they were sort of moving towards me like they're all connected but when i was trying to decide whether to open or close my eyes this like entity came it was invisible an invisible entity but i could sense it was there and where it was it suddenly moved like through the realities and was getting mad at me it's like it came from wherever it was all the way here to tell me that sorry let me just mute my music i came from wherever just just to tell me like just to tell me where was i holy fuck this is so hard to talk about i came oh yeah i came from wherever was just to tell me it doesn't matter like when my eyes are open or closed like stop thinking about all that stupid shit and i didn't see any entities as usual i don't see entities sometimes i do they're usually robots but uh this time it wasn't except that that that entity i guess you would call it but it was like invisible and then also when it was telling me not to um it doesn't matter if your eyes are open and closed it wasn't telling it to me it was telling it to something else i don't know what that was and i was just like obser observing that that that message what was it talking to like maybe my brain and i the observer like the soul i guess you can refer to it as or whatever was the one observing that you know which sort of like lends to the idea like the separation of body and soul you know like two separate things like you and your life aren't the same thing look at this pose i'm sitting in this very i don't know it feels right though okay i'm not a two-year-old sit like a man oh where did this come from was i holding this the whole time i don't know i don't know i just don't know um the visuals are very cool like yeah i realize now definitively i know now it doesn't matter if your eyes are open or closed people always have that debate if you smoke enough um like maybe it will vary the experience but it not the intensity of it or how good it is necessarily you know like if you smoke enough if your eyes are open it'll take whatever you're looking at and transform that into whatever so like i was looking at you know my room became all multiple universes like on a thread like reeling past me and then this fucking being darting around it was like this that was like the master i don't want to say god because it wasn't that it didn't seem benevolent either it didn't seem evil but it just it seemed like it was getting shit done it was busy and it didn't it seemed a little angry that it had to be there to tell me like deal with this trivial shit like it had better things to do i got the sense and it's like you know tell this idiot whoever it was talking to he doesn't need to or he wasn't he didn't call me an idiot but i got the sense that he was frustrated like short he she whatever it and um it was like yeah tell tell him it doesn't matter you know or it wasn't even saying tell him it was just talking to him it was like it doesn't matter and i was just like observing it and i didn't hear those words it was just i got the sense that's what uh it was trying to communicate to my body or whatever it was talking to um the visuals like afterwards and then before that seems like a short trip also i start talking like while i'm still tripping and i think that's what sort of takes me out of it because i'm like aware i wasn't for a second or two but i'm aware that i'm recording and doing a chirp report so i start like i start talking sitting up while like most people still probably have their eyes closed i don't know or maybe it wasn't short maybe just uh that's my perception of it that was fucking intense though it's funny the visuals i had on my screen oh yeah another thing too the audio went it muted itself i'm gonna have to check uh the playback and see like if my actual audio muted because i have music playing i'm just i'm gonna cut out the parts when i'm not talking um i'm going to check if it actually muted because that was weird because at one point i was hearing the music and it just cut out completely it was silent for a few seconds which is a weird hallucination like canceling out your sound that's pretty like intense like it has some like pretty high permissions in your brain to be able to like access that that sort of shit like mute all sounds you know that's like administrator privileges you know like you can't just mute the fucking sound in my brain like what are you doing it's crazy it did though and then well oh yeah when i was closing and opening my eyes i don't know if i was or not but i think if you if you look in the video they'll show a part where i'm like sort of like opening and closing them i was like going back and forth at least my memory tells me that's what i did during that part like all the effects were like flickering on and off like i mentioned in my when did i mention that i think it was in my live stream i don't know but i was talking about how sometimes the effects they just flicker on and off like an rgb cable being wiggled in the back of an old computer you'd see the colors just flicker instantly right and what was oh yeah that was happening when it's opening closing the eyes with everything all the effects it's just like very computer simulated like themes of simulation here but not not totally this time that that entity seemed beyond beyond like a computer simulation you know uh it's weird too when that's happening it's like oh my god i have the answer this is crazy but so that's like a delusional thought obviously but i'm still there i'm still conscious because i remember thinking like wait till i tell my subscribers i got to see her to the universe like this is going to make a banger video you know meaning of life and i'm at for a good 30 seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds i thought that i'm like i know i know everything i know the answer and uh i can't wait this can make a great video isn't that funny and then slowly it starts you start realizing like wait a second that can't be true and i know it's not true because every trip is like different like last trip like something else was the answer now the answer is this you know there's several meanings to life apparently but this i've never had a trip where i imagined something that it's like beyond like something i couldn't come up with myself you know so i'm not convinced that dmt is um anything supernatural just yet but i don't find it any less poetic or beautiful or spiritual or anything like that you know it's just to me it's a testament to how complex the human brain is and how incredible nature is you know in life itself life is the trip as i say dmt is just like i made this analogy to someone earlier in the comments life okay dmt is like a program and life is like the operating system you know what i mean like psychedelic trips are just a small thing that happens within life oh my shit's about to shut off i think or no i just split the recording so part of it might just cut out so i'm just gonna repeat what i just said i forget what i just said fuck am i scratching my nuts geez okay ignore the last 10 seconds i'm probably going to keep it in for comedic effect but ignore it that was a really cool trip that every trip has a different vibe to it there's like a few main categories each one is unique but there's some broader categories too like some of them are funny some of them are very spiritual and uplifting like my two live trips one and two those ones were very spiritual and uplifting and afterwards i felt like at peace with the world i don't really have that this time although i do feel good but um i this one was more like the ones based in outer space always have the same vibe to them and those ones are all about like how the universe works and god and stuff like that and higher powers and those ones are fascinating not necessarily positive or overwhelmingly positive or scary just it feels like it's showing me the truth so it's it's not trying to be anything it's just the truth right and it's those ones are like awesome not like awesome like you know like awesome dude like it's full of awe you know awe inspiring like mind mind-blowing and just i don't know i'm going to have to look back at the tape but i'm pretty sure i was just like oh really good like five minutes not that long three or four minutes maybe i don't know it's funny i'm like the visuals on my screen ended up being like the least interesting thing ever i'm like looking at universes suddenly i'm going to watch i want to watch this youtube visual oh i've had youtube visuals turn into amazing things before so that's why i throw them on sometimes thing barely went down too how many hits that i i tried to take more hits but i couldn't feel the pen anymore it felt like it was over here and my jaw was like disconnecting and like it was like numb and shit you know when you don't know like where the pen is or how to hit it or and this thing's easy to hit when you you can't feel it you know that's when you're good to go this is a pretty strong pen or the liquid i think both um seems to work really well compared to most anecdotes i've heard about the efficacy of these pens a lot of people say it's really hard for them to get like a breakthrough dose that was like borderline breakthrough so that was like a low-level breakthrough dose i would say i don't like the term breakthrough but for those of you who go by that system i would say this is like a barely breakthrough barely i broke through barely it wasn't like uh as intense as some breakthrough trips i've had and it doesn't definitely wasn't sub breakthrough i was yeah i was out of here and when that fucking entity started beaming around i felt so powerless like i felt like oh fuck like this thing is boss whatever you i couldn't see it i just sense where it was it was invisible i'm wheezy okay that was great guys i think i'm gonna play some video games smoke a big bowl of marijuana and um maybe have it no no i gotta quit drinking fuck for real for real i gotta quit drinking i gotta stop masturbating snow not november is not going well guys what is it it's fucking february i think i need another extension i failed again i failed every day every day i failed no not november in february so the ninth extension this thing is dope as fuck i hate smoking empty even if you're doing bong hits which is like the easiest way to smoke tmt it's still kind of like a bit of a process to get the lighter to pull the ball out you know just it's it's hard on your second or third hit to do that this thing's fucking easy though i took double poles like someone suggested to me in the comments whoever what that was thank you good idea because this thing cuts out after five seconds so but if you just stop and then start again it resets the timer so um i could take two hits in one that that way essentially that fucking second hit i took or was it the third i don't know that was a huge fucking hit and i held those in for a long time you guys i have a pretty big lung capacity so i think it's easy easier for me than most people to get the dose in you know like i imagine for someone who doesn't smoke weed every day um it would be much harder much much harder to take hits like that because dmt is pretty harsh it's harshly different way it doesn't burn because it's vaporized but it's it's it's spikier you know it's got a i don't know if you know what i mean by that but it spikes your lungs more than weed weed is like it's hot obviously because you burn it and it can burn if you take a big hit but i don't know vapor has like it's like the initial feeling when you you take it in is harsher for the empty for sure but then once it's in there then it's fine work weeds the other way around it kind of burns more and more the more you hold it in uh no nausea at all which is good okay guys i'm sorry if the camera just uh changed angles and it was jarring i apologize but i finished the vlog then i went and got a hot dog which i would which i can't wait to eat but but a couple more details came to me and i will forgo eating this hot dog i'm not foregoing it i'm putting it off i will eat this hot dog but a couple details came to me while i was in the kitchen that i forgot to talk about so during the trip i talked about i think i mentioned i blurted out like eye coordinates or something like that that was supposed to be a reminder for me to talk about it later because i couldn't explain it at the time but i knew i'd be able to later i want this offering so bad this happened to me in at least 10 trips before and in a couple of my last ones i keep forgetting to mention it though but at the very beginning when i'm coming up and i'm looking around i'll see numbers in the corner two numbers and i'll see like a crosshair in my vision like tracking my eye movement and it moves wherever i move my eye and the numbers change depending where i'm looking like they're coordinates tracking my eye movement like an x and a y coordinate it's very weird another thing too is in the trips where like it's the universe being revealed to me how it works in those trips like in outer space at the very beginning often it's like you've been chosen we're selecting you it doesn't say that but i it's like i hear i sense what they're trying to say without hearing the audio so it would be like you know you're chosen like you're special basically we're showing you how the universe works and you're going to be the messiah you're going to be the one to like tell everyone about this and i i get that sense and i've gotten that sense in several trips probably at least five before where it's like you've been chosen almost like a lottery like uh out of like trillions infinite number of souls they chose me to like give me the secrets and then i'm gonna go and tell everybody apparently that's how it works and that's weird that i get that but i've gotten that yeah several times i just wanted to mention that okay back to the video or maybe the video is ending now i don't know where i'm going to insert this clip so maybe bye i love you guys or maybe back to the show i don't know i'm leaving my options open it's hot talk time i deserve this hot dog pro tip pro tip if you're microwaving a hot dog throw the bun in there for a good 10 seconds the water molecule something happens to them in the bun in it it gets soft and like

Winters Company offers plumbing, heating,\ncooling. If you need service today; we're the business\nto call. My website is wintershomeservices.com. I'll be talking to you today about plumbing. How to fix a ceramic faucet with a ceramic\ndisk replacement cartridge. Kitchen sink faucet, pretty standard, we have\none here, a pull-out spray, most houses have them now. Just for the sake of time, I've already shut\nthe water off to this faucet, so the first thing to do is test it to make sure that the\nwater is off. Test the hot, and test the cold. With this faucet, what we're looking to do\nis change the ceramic disk, which is going to be underneath the handle, and so I'm going\nto walk you through that process right now. So you want to take the spout, turn it off\nto the side, take the handle, lift it straight up. This nut right here, we're looking to take\nthis handle off, some faucets have an allen-wrench set screw in the back, some faucets just pull\nstraight off, this one here has a little decorative red and blue rubber stopper, and if you take\nit out with your fingers, set it off to the side. So, in order to take this handle off, you\nhave to use a very small allen-wrench. This allen-wrench size is about 1/8th of an\ninch, and you insert it into that hole, back off the screw, not all the way, you don't\nneed to, and it lifts off, set it off to the side. Now you're going to see this little plastic\npiece, this is decorative. This little decorative piece, you don't want\nto put a tool on, its usually just hand-tight, get a good grip, back it off. Now there's a glass piece that holds in this\ncartridge, sits right on top. So you want to take your time and you want\nto back off this brass piece, and you want to use your channel locks (xx xx xx) and you\nwant to back it out. Then set your hardware off to the side, now\nthe cartridges will move straight up. Take notice that the cartridge has a couple\nof little plastic protrusions in the back. This little red piece, these are the O-rings,\nthis is usually what leaks, and if it does, quite simply you just take a ceramic cartridge\nand you put a new one in. We happen to have one ready to go, so, this\nceramic cartridge goes right back in the same way it came out, and we're looking to line\nup these little protrusions in the back of the faucet. You take it, drop it back in, make sure its\nnice and tight and not moving anywhere. Take your channel-lock pliers, tighten it\ndown until its firm. Reverse the procedure, take your decorative\nchrome piece, put that down, and what I'd like to do is just put the handle back on\nfor now. I want to turn the water on, run the faucet,\nmake sure its not leaking anymore, make sure nothing's hidden, so I don't have to do it\ntwice. Okay the water's back on, now we're going\nto test it out, appears to be working well. So now I can take my allen-wrench, put it\nback in. And that's how you fix a ceramic disk faucet.\"", "7UbXmKW-v6o": "all right so our repair starts by turning off the water under the second okay all right we want to rebuild this control unit but before we do anything I always like to put a rag right there so the parts don't go down the drain I want to start by taking off this index okay it's red and blue and it covers up a little set screw underneath and I want to pry that out now underneath it there's an allen screw right here which holds the handle on now in the kit there's a special tool that has an allen wrench on this end so I'll loosen that now the handle comes off now underneath you can see there's a ball assembly right here and this tool also has a spanner wrench that allow me to loosen some of the tension and once I do I should be able to back this top cap assembly off okay so now I'm going to remove the entire ball and the water that's in the spout will help will settle down thank goodness I have that rag there huh perfect planning all right so let's pull this up and we see the heart of the faucet is this this ball now the ball sits down against the seats at the bottom see the two black things right there the one on the left is hot the one on the right is cold and it's full water pressure coming up there now when the handle is fall forward this ball seals against those rubber seats in the waters off but now if we pull the handle back look what happens the two openings line up with the two seats at the bottom so hot and cold mix come out through here and goes out through the spout when we go now go to the left we'll just get hot go to the right we just get cold now this is stainless steel this generally is not a part that wears out and it looks pretty good the part that usually wears is right down here the seats let me just pull them out and see how there all right so look at this you see that score mark right there another one right there so those little Nick's caused our leak that's enough this full city water pressure so you have to make sure it's absolutely tight all right so that was bad let's see what the other one looks like that one's pretty worn too all right so here's our two worn seats right here here's the two new ones there's also a couple of springs and these Springs are really important the springs sit underneath the seats and they're going to provide the correct tension so you have a nice tight seal against the full city water pressure that's coming through that seat okay see if that was all afraid like yours was that's why you get the leak through the spot now the best tool for getting the seat and spring into the faucet itself is a number two pencil and that will help me guide it right down into place okay this one all right so our seats are in place now we need to install the ball you see on the side of the ball there's a little key way and look inside the fuzzy little tab on the side yeah I see that that actually lines up right here and that will make sure the ball is oriented correctly in relation to those hot and cold seats now we want to make sure we also don't have any water coming up through the faucets so out of the kit I have a new cam assembly that has a gasket right here that goes over the top of that ball and also this cam cap right here now you'll notice here there's a key way you see on the side right here there's another little key way and that goes in so once that's in place look what it does it actually limits how far that can travel so the handle can be off hot cold or off nice all right so now that is essentially done now we just have to put the chrome cap assembly over the top and as I do it'll help tension that gasket on to the top of that ball perfect I'd like to go hand tight as tight as I can and not use pliers to scratch it up so good so now I'm going to turn the water back on okay using the same tool that came in the kit I can actually adjust the amount of tension that's on the handle you can see right here there's a couple of notches and this is the Glen nut that I can tighten up turn a clockwise and that will provide more tension down against the ball there you go okay that feels pretty good you want it to have a little bit of tension I want it to be sloppy all right now with that on that's holding we just have to reverse the procedure put the handle back on tighten the Allen screw pop in the index give it a try all right let's see what happens quite hope it works the way it should be you did it we're out of here so yeah good job thank you I'll fix one little chip you got yourself a happy home oh absolutely so it seems to me that the key to this repair is finding just the right parts for exactly the faucet you have is that easy to do well that's a name-brand manufacturing even though they have a ton of different styles of faucet the basic part inside the chest of water on and off is the same across the line so this is the same manufacturing this is one of the most popular faucets in the history of American plumbing millions and millions of these and if you look underneath here what do you say well this faucet doesn't look anything like her faucets so but you're telling me that inside oh yeah there's the same at all there's a seats and springs Wow so if you've got this box you're in pretty good shape you can keep rebuilding that faucet and keep it alive for a long time but those are where parts that will wear out over time those rubber seats down the bottom this is the same manufacturer and now they're moving into a new technology called ceramic discs so if I look underneath here what do you not see I don't see that stainless steel ball no more ball now it's a cartridge and what's inside the cartridge is really cool you can see right here there are two pieces of ceramic right here and they are milled together so beautifully that they almost stick and stay attracted to each other so now do you remember inside that ball we had the hot and the cold holes right there yeah and it would mix into the faucet right here so if I look underneath now with the faucet handle shut you see how those holes are blocked off no water now when I move the handle both little both come in when I go to one side go to the other side and this just moves back and forth back and so what's the idea that the ceramic is not going to leak it's going to hold up a lot longer than the rubber gasps that's right then actually the more you use this the more it actually hones these services makes a nice tight seal so no rubber gaskets in this cartridge that could ever fail well the only rubber is actually at the bottom of this gasket it's going to sit down at the bottom but it doesn't move it's just going to sit in one place so it shouldn't wear out and the more you use this the more to last it should last a long time so hopefully no leaks but if you do have a leak can I still go buy one of those boxes of all the different parts well you wouldn't need a lot of little parts now you would just go out and get this whole cartridge turn the water off pull the old one out put the new one in be done with beautiful great fix good information thank you Richard so till next time I'm Kevin O'Connor I'm richer 34 ask this old house so really 3,000 gallons of water from that one level one second at a John that's unbelievable", "y1iAUxgyEic": "need to renovate your house why not do it yourself Henkel makes your life easier you will now learn how to stick a splash guard in the kitchen what do you need a construction adhesive a kitchen cleaner paper towel a cutting board a wooden board a cutter knife a handgun and a waste box follow these steps to get a perfect result for your job first you have to clean the substrate otherwise the adhesive will be less efficient take the cartridge and put the tip onto a piece of wood to stabilize it while cutting extrude 5 centimeters of paste to avoid possible damage product that could reduce adhesive properties then screw the nozzle onto the cartridge use the piece of wood to cut the nozzle the diameter should be around 6 millimeters put the cartridge into the handgun lay continuous beads of adhesive do not flatten them by pressing too hard apply with constant speed and pressure always try and apply the same amount of adhesive stick the splash guard on the wall press it gently against the wall check the final position it's done", "bWGkp-NMlZo": "welcome everybody we're going to be looking at some of the Gerber cartridges first of all Gerber has used the same basic cartridges from the very beginning for the from the beginning concept we've added some ceramics and some washi less cartridges along the way we're going to concentrate on the compression and the ceramics right now in the beginning we had the compression stem and it is basically up and down motion rotary it goes more than a quarter turn can go 360 actually and it has a rubber seal on the end of it sometimes commonly called as a bib washer and it seats against the removable seat renewable seat in the bottom of the valve and makes a seal and as it pulls up it away allows the water to flow some of the problems with this is the rubber washer deteriorates over several years of years use and on the seat itself if you have a small drip you leave it on slightly so after a while the actual water will actually cut the metal itself given in what we call a wire draw so because of that the seat and the seat washer are easily replaceable in products toys from the top in the interim they came out with a watch oohs cartridge which you take the seat out and you place the watchos cartridge in its self-contained unit this is different than a lot of watchlists cartridges in the marketplace the valve body does not have to change it's still you can take the cartridge out to the compression cartridge out and it still will work and then along came the ceramic cartridge which is basically a watchlist cartridge as well only instead of rubber and plastic components we use ceramic discs to control the water flow withstands a little bit better of the debris that can be in water such as grid and rust and particles that water picks up so it's just a little bit more durable version of the washers cartridge again it can be placed in the same cavity as a watch list or a compression cartridge can that's throughout the whole Gerber line from about 1972 forward they have they did not have the washer list or the ceramic prior to that time and they had a little different sealing method of where the cartridge goes into the body and making a seal at the top instead of a small plastic washer like they have now they used to have a flat red fiber washer it is possible for these to work in those valves but you got to be a little bit more cautious about that because there is no place to trap this plastic washer tub and shower valves were always compression up until about 1992 or 93 and they have a longer stem they again have to have a seat removable seat and a seat washer to make the seal and would operate just like a lab or kitchen faucet with those components this is for an in-wall conceal two or three handle valve four handle valve for the on and off sides of the valve we made right-hand and left-hand version or hot and cold versions later on when we start in developing lever handles as you know round handles always tend to turn both counter clockwise to turn on clockwise to turn off lever handles they go opposite each other so you have to have different turning in the three handle valve we have a diverter valve which is building compression cartridge here again it has a seat down here for the direction to go to the spout let's say and then in the upper portion here it has what we call a top hat or a top washer so that when it is open it will go to the shower so it's it's a about a half turn five H turn cartridge because just of the travel and it will divert water up or down depending upon what you like to have again in the early 90s we developed a ceramic cartridge to go into those valves what we did because the machining of the valves were not as critical for compression cartridge we didn't hold that depth as critically as we maybe should have thinking about developing a ceramic cartridge so we tried to develop the ceramic cartridge so that will retrofit back some of the early years and stuff we cannot guarantee it anything prior to 1990 but most oftentimes it will work with the advent of our hard water series in our classic brand we came up with a single handle ceramic cartridge as well and this is the second generation of the cartridge the previous supplier was more expensive so we went to less expensive supplier plus we now have a limit stop on the valve on the cartridge that will limit the travel into the hot water position the reason for that some daycare centers use this for you know laboratory faucets kitchen faucets where children might use it and it's also utilized in our tub and shower valves our classic line for our hard water line we can put the hot limit stop there as you know if there's a law for that and that's just a quick synopsis of our cartridges I do want to back up the dis Sukkot and say that we have a Roman tub cartridge as you can see it's very close to the ceramic lab and things but it's a little different in height a little different in diameter and it has a larger flow amount of flow because a Roman tub pillars you want to feel quicker", "cior4pVoKCA": "hi guys I'm Dan HOF chief operating officer of honey stick and today we're gonna give you guys from popular demand a little tutorial on 510 thread stick vape batteries now we've been getting a lot of questions on what the differences are between different types of stick batteries so this quick video is gonna give you guys a nice little tutorial about what the key differences are between stick batteries and a lot of these we actually do sell so the first question is what is 510 thread 510 thread is the actual thread adapter that is used by a majority of vape cartridges these are cartridges they're prefilled with CBD or different medical oils that you can pick up at your dispensary and what companies will do is they will pre-fill these so that you buy just a cartridge and then you go and purchase and attach it to your own battery in order for you to be able to vape so 99% of the cartridges sold in dispensaries and CBD shops use what is called a 5-10 thread which is actually just the threading of the cartridge now not only do prefilled cartridges use this but a lot of just vape products like even slim wax adapters like our silencer they also use a 5-10 thread so they can appeal for the dabbing crowd so once you've figured out what you want to vape then it comes down to picking your battery and what the differences are between your batteries and what i've done is i've narrowed them down to four main types of batteries the first one and one of our most popular ones is the twist style battery so it has a 5-10 thread which will allow you to screw in the cartridge like for example our performance cartridge to screw that into the battery so it has a 5-10 thread adapter there or an end right there it has a push button which means that you have to push hold the button throughout your inhale and because it's a twist battery it has a little twist knob here that allows you to adjust the intensity of your vape and this one goes between 2 volts and 4 volts 4 volts being higher giving you greater intensity now how do you turn this battery on once you have your vape Karcher attached you simply push this button 5 times to turn it on 1 2 3 4 5 and you see it's gonna flash and that means that you are ready to vape once your cartridge is on there now most of these twist batteries ours included does have a preheat function on it for when you're using a cartridge for the first time there's thick materials in there that need to be preheated before you can vape and that's achieved by pushing the button when it's on twice in succession so you push it twice rapidly one two and you see the LED is changing colors there that means there's going through a low voltage preheat to get your cartridge right of vaping at any time during the preheat you can push the button to exit so that is our twist battery it is very simple to use not a lot of clicking adjustable power there nice 510 battery these are a high capacity and they come in several colors I brought along the multicolor in the red and we actually even just launched a brand new carbon fiber version which it uses real carbon fiber so there's a real carbon fiber version right here the other battery is a 5-10 variable voltage non twist battery so you have your 510 adapter here that you can screw your cartridges into or of a products that you buy like for example your prefilled cartridge show you guys we're prefilled one looks like so here's a pretty little prefilled cartridge simply screw it on in there this one is a variable voltage but it's a non twist this is actually a pass-through as you can see a pass-through meaning that the charging port is here at the bottom so you can actually if you're vaping and it's running down or you're one of those people who works at your desk or in your car you can have it plugged into microUSB have the battery on in succession while you're charging the battery which means you don't have to take off the cartridge to screw in a charger so this one does not have a twist function on it this has just a button but you still have variable voltage and preheat the difference is is that you would change the voltage by clicking the buttons and Wogan that so to turn the unit on you click the button five times rapidly one two three four five as you see it blinks right there now it's on if you wanted to go in to preheat as we do it the other battery same thing push the button two times one two and you can see the LED again is going into the color change mode you can exit that at any time to get out of preheat mode and if you want to change the voltage what you do is you push the button three times quickly one two three and what you'll notice is that the LED changes different color now what that signifies there is that now you're on a different voltage level so your power intensity has been adjusted and this battery actually comes with three voltage settings three different intensity levels and you can cycle through them by just clicking the button three times one two three now you see the LED turn blue so blue red and green so that shows your variable voltage nan twist five ten stick battery for your reference the other battery that I've outlined is a 5-10 thread a lot of people refer to this as a stylus because it has a little stylus tip that people used to use for their Palm Pilots and you could use for your cell phones and touchscreen devices but as you will notice this battery is a standard it's a buttonless battery so it doesn't have a button on it so what you do is when you put your cartridge on there you don't have to turn it on or anything like that just make sure it's charged all you have to do is inhale so it's a different action you don't push and hold the button throughout the duration your vape as the other two batteries we showed you you just simply inhale and it will turn it on a couple of things to point out at this battery so a lot of companies do sell batteries like this we don't because for auto draws to fire ceramic cartridges they have to be much more powerful and we offer auto draw models like our elf concealers and elf twist but they provide a lot more power so they can fire ceramic cartridges that have thick heaters this little battery doesn't have much power to fire some of the more modern cartridges the other thing is it to be Auto draw it requires your cartridges to have an air hole at the bottom like this one let's see if we can zoom in to make sure people see that there's an air hole here so this cartridge has an air hole which means that when you inhale it lets the air travel through the cartridge which then reacts with a little sensor microphone in the battery that signals the battery to turn on into vaporize now if we take a look at these two cartridges we'll notice that they don't have air holes so you would technically not be able to use these two cartridges on this Auto draw battery stylus battery when you would be able to vape them just fine with the twist batteries I showed you before or the non twist variable voltage battery that I showed you just before that so that's just a little bit to keep in mind when you're selecting your 5/10 or your perfect 510 third stick battery now the last battery that's pretty popular is this ego style battery now this is a 510 and also stick battery and I see a lot of people carrying these with cartridges that ask however you'll see this is a little bit different than this because look at the the difference this this right here is flattened flush where you screw the cartridge in and this one kind of pokes out and you have this exposed piece that's because there's two different 510 threads is your standard 510 cartridge thread so it's your 510 C thread and this one is your 510 ego thread an ego thread means that there used to be cartridges for a liquid that would screw on to the exterior of this and make an interior connection so you can use it with the older style eliquid tanks as well as with prefilled cartridges well you'll notice is if you're really into just prefilled cartridges is when you screw it into this ego tank it this transition looks a little funky it'll still work and they work good but you'll see that this just doesn't look that nice it looks like I need like a transition piece of metal there like a skirt or something like that and you know this is a fatter battery so as you could see the widths don't exactly line up like other tanks like this you'll see it's a much smoother transition it looks like they're all one piece versus like this now there's lots of ego batteries on the market there's ones that have twist knobs there's ones that are longer the thing is that you can these are about 500 milliamp hour batteries for so that's a pretty good decent capacity for a battery these ones are usually between 350 and 650 they're this size you can get longer ones or all the way up to 1200 or 1100 milliamp hours so you can get ultra high-capacity powerful fat ego batteries like this but one of the trade-offs is if you do use a lot of cartridges they're not gonna line up they're not gonna look a hundred percent with these stick batteries they line up so you can use all different types of heating materials like ceramic cartridges standard a stainless steel or organic cotton coil cartridges you can use high performance ceramic like our performance tank you can even use wax tanks like our silencer with these little 510 thread batteries so we hope that today's video was useful in showing you guys the differences between the different 510 thread battery types and we familiarize you with some of the pros and cons are of each one so when you are on the market trying to pick up a 5-10 thread stick battery you can see some of these differences and figure out which 510 thread stick battery works

tutorial I'm going to show you how to fix a leaking kitchen sink faucet now right here in front of you is a delta single lever faucet Delta is the name of the brand that makes the faucet as you can see it's leaking so I'm going to show you how to fix it the first thing you need to do is to shut the water off now under the sink you should have hot and cold shutoff valves you have to shut them both off you have one here if you have to shut that off okay come to shutoff oh well okay with the water shut off the next thing you're going to need is a set of washers and Springs this cost me two dollars okay now the next thing you're going to need is a hex key has to be this size and you have to remove the set screw which is right here okay with the setscrew removed we can just lift up the lever okay now the next thing you're going to need is a pipe wrench now inside as you can see there are two washers and under those washers are Springs so I'm going to remove them now with a slight head screwdriver like you see here I'm going to gently we move the washers now this is important to see the way I removed it the cupped area is on the bottom so I'm going to face it right down here this way I can reverse the sequence when I install them okay let me get the second washer okay now I'm going to remove the springs okay now as you can see the narrow part of the spring is facing upper it and the white part of the spring is downward so that's how the spring goes back in when we reinstall it okay your spoon number two okay there's a lot of wear on the black washers compared to the new washer you could even see the black washers have different size and this could be because one of them is more worn than the other so they needed to be replaced okay the narrow part of the spring goes into the seat of the washer like so so I'm going to take the screwdriver put it on and put it in now I'm going to press it firmly into place okay now for the second one just press it firmly in place now it's better to wash this off before you reinstall it okay now this part right here this is the ball this just goes in right like that now you have this washer and that goes into this pot here now if you look closely there's a stump right here where my finger is and that has to align with a nut right over here so you just put that in that and rest it for only on okay now we install the cap careful not to cross the tread okay that's tight okay now I'm going to install the lever okay now I'm going to install the set screw now I'm going to use the allen key to tighten it okay so I'm going to turn the water back on and see how it works out okay so I'm going to turn the faucet on and there you go no more leak the leak has been fixed so I hope you found this video useful if you have please show your support for this channel by subscribing feel free to leave comments please like up the video and thank you for tuning in", "l9y9DBbjE5k": "hi there my name is Michael Brown and worked for John the plumber today the customers asses to change out a cartridge due to the fact that our faucets leaking so today we're going to demonstrate on how to change out a cartridge on a delta faucet first things first we'd want to shut off our water shut off the water perfect now so that we don't damage the customers counter and put a cloth down grab our tools press them on the pot and we're ready to begin taking out our target I always recommend putting in the plug so if you happen to drop any small items they don't pull down the drain first things first we need to remove the plug remove the plug I use a knife it's got a nice sharp edge so that we don't scratch the finish there we remove the plug use the proper allen key so that we do not strip it in your back you so inside we need to remove little rubber o-ring and a spring re remove one pre-installation process so first things first we would install our springs the larger end of the spring in first with the taper facing upwards the first thing we do when we're reinstalling our cartridge is install our springs this as you can see these Springs are larger on the bottom sitting around the top so we put the taper to Evan facing upwards it's 12 now we can install our rubber o-rings over the springs so our Springs and o-rings are installed we are now ready to install our cartridge as you can see on our cartridge we have a slot here this slot must match up with this pin so that it functions proper as you can see I have it in there correctly and install the top part of our cartridge you can see here there's a pin I coincides with the notch on the side we're going to line those up here we go reinstall the caller now these callers do not have to be tightened down with pliers just hand tight should be sufficient now we install our handle see on our handle this little hole goes in here along the set screw and we just tighten our set screw snap really solve our problem now that we were done installing our cartridge we're going to test it to make sure it doesn't leak first things first is we pull out our plug that we don't overflow this thing in turn on the water it's cold we push it in the backyard clot upon and shut it off and it's not leaking we've successfully changed our country thanks a lot hope this helped you out and have a nice day", "ypLvBgoonnU": "welcome to this short installation video brought to you by the friendly folks at Pfister here we will demonstrate how to replace your reversible 1/4 turned ceramic disc cartridge on your fist or faucet to begin shut off the water supply to your faucet remove the on-off handles by turning the base counter clockwise until it can be removed if your handles have set screws loosen them with a 3/32 allen wrench and remove the handles be careful not to lose the set screws [Music] use a pair of pliers to grab the retainer nut and turn it counterclockwise until it can be loosened by hand remove the retainer nut and remove the cartridge from the body locate the plastic clip that sits at the bottom of the cartridge stem and pull it out the default setting of the cartridge is for the hot or left handle which is indicated by the notches on the stopper facing down if you want to use this cartridge for the cold or right handle you need to remove the stopper and flip it upside down so the notches are now facing up then replace the stopper onto the base of the cartridge rotate the ring until it seats properly reinsert the plastic clip to secure the stopper insert the cartridge into the body and rotate gently to ensure it's properly seated reinstall the retainer nut and tighten it with your pliers now [Music] turn on the water supply to check for leaks if you find a leak turn the water supply off and recheck that the cartridge and retainer nut are securely fastened reinstall the on/off handles ensure they are oriented in the off position before tightening them test your faucet to ensure all components are working properly great job thank you for watching if you have any questions visit our website at Pfister comm or give us a call at you [Music]", "AZz-s2xLLvw": "hey guys Sami I'll show you how to install a cartridge on your Delta Faucet so the first thing I want to do is take off the knob and it's just basically just unscrew it and then of course turn the water off first again the next thing what I do is take your allen wrench and there's that one screw then you want to take off and now enable you to take off the top of the actual handle so just pull it straight up and it should come off and then which one I do is take off this nut okay and then basically you can just pull the actual cartridge straight out so I'll basically this hat I mean we're changing it because the actual handle was leaking but if the faucet is leaking you get this one changing this will work too so next thing you want to do is go ahead and take out there's a rubber gasket and a spring inside so take those two things out and then you you know change them with the new one - I do is take a allen wrench or whatever something on line it up put the new spring and a gasket in there into the hole right there so that's what it looks like when it's lined up now which what I do is go and put the new cartridge in it does matter which side so that gold piece the flat flag points out and then since we were doing the cold faucet that tabs you go on top and then you put it into the cylinder and then that's basically it put the nut back on everything else is in reverse order so that's basically it so I hope it's helped yeah", "zGYZkyvEDkI": "hello everybody cheapest vape supplies dot-com here doing a product review on the double concentrate and cartridge bubbler this is one cool product we looked high and low and couldn't find anything comparable on the market to this device very unique so underneath the box here we have a card that this comes with and then we have a little instruction manual and then we have the main contents so this thing it looks a lot bigger in real life than it does on the box itself seems huge it's like the size of your whole hand it's got a gasket here at the top it's got a glass tube here okay right behind it and what you do is you just pull this glass tube out of here you see this little little bubbler here it goes all the way down you want you see this ring here you want to seat that ring right to where that silicone is eventually you're gonna fill this up with water here when you're ready to use it right now we'll just go ahead and attach it in here just squeeze it down push it down gently till it clicks there you go and right there now you're ready to go now here we go the magic is right here pull this off here and you have to cartridge 510 thread female receptacles so here we go we have a 1 mil seesaw style cartridge alright the black ceramic tip and then we have a white one Mel C cell style cartridge began with a ceramic tip so once these are screwed in obviously if you know you're gonna use the liquid in there you're not gonna do this empty so there you have it and then you just simply put this right back on top here and you're good to go now you have two cartridges going at the same time you can basically blend two different styles and create your own hybrids this button here is your power button two times re I'm sorry three times to change the voltage five times to turn it on and off and hold it down you know indefinitely for as long as you want to you know inhale very cool product we are going to sell them cheaper than the retailer that sells these on their site just to give our customers a little extra you know price savings like we always try to these will be on our website WWF is beeps applies calm very shortly here we also have another style that is a single cartridge style just like this but instead of having two cartridges it's just going to be the one we're gonna do a video on that very soon here as well again thank you everybody enjoy your day Chivas vape supplies that kind of everyday", "4k0qumqCKYQ": "hey guys it's Jason from best friend this is a demonstration video of the best one guys cartridge fill the gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "eEWALEIGJvM": "all right so this Moen kitchen faucet here we're having an issue with and it's not the most common issue that you see on YouTube is that it drips when it's off obviously it's not dripping which I believe is the cartridge which is underneath the handle here the issue we have when you turn it on we get water I believe dripping out of here and running down and you'll see like a little puddle down in here let's see if I can get it to do that so we got water water coming now in an idle mole okay it looks like it's alright so yeah it was coming out right up and right up in here it was actually coming down on this side here there it is you can see where the water is coming down so this has happened one other time the first time I had this exact same faucet I just threw it away and replaced it because I was so frustrated and the second time I just started doing this I was really not happy I was gonna throw it away and just get a different brand of faucet but then I started reading reviews and other faucets had the same type of issue so I actually called Moen I explained the situation they said well it's actually covered under the limited lifetime warranty so I guess the way it works as long as you're the original owner of the faucet they'll cover it and I told the guy what was happening he's like well it could be the cartridge and I said no I don't think so I'll say I took this off and I looked in there and I said no it that doesn't seem like where it was leaking it's leaking below and he's like well it sounds like the only other thing it could be is that there's like I guess two o-rings in here so he's like I'm just gonna send you everything he's like replace the cartridge replace the old rings so that's what we're gonna do today and hopefully that stops the water from running out here but kind of happy that they send the parts and he actually just sent everything it didn't cost me anything they'll ship and they also sent directions for it as well okay so here are the parts and so we got the spout or ring kit 14 6789 is the part number and that's what I'm assuming is the problem not even would give you a grease good deal gonna have to put on stairs and get that otherwise and this would be the cartridge so 12:55 is the cartridge number for this faucet I think the only really use 2 cartridge numbers I don't recall the other one top my head so this is the full kit comes with the little allen wrench it comes with the little set screw for the handle it looks like it's got some Loctite on it or thread not thread sealer but like a thread Locker so let's get the water turned off and set up here and get this changed out okay so first obviously you want to make sure that the water is off your house may have shut offs underneath the sink if it's nor if it's older I don't think it was cold that they had to have like shut offs at each fixture you might have to turn the water off the entire house I know I added shutoff valves to every single fixture in the house because we only have the shut-off at the pressure tank so first thing is we got to pop off this little this screw in here for this little cap I had this off one other time just to kind of check and I'm gonna try to do this little carving into my thumb like I did last night so this is all crusty we're just gonna slip that on the side and then we're gonna pop open the full 55 here they didn't send directions and I kind of briefly looked them over the directions are extremely basic so I don't think we need them I mean it looks like it's pretty much self-explanatory there isn't much tool at least the directions for the whoring I don't know about the cartridges there's some special something other but here here's what the oops here's what the cartridge looks like there you go so I'm like I said I don't believe that to be the issue but might be so they give you a little tiny allen wrench here I don't know if it says the size on it probably not so we're gonna get in here and take out that sets root it holds the handle on oh boy I must have really cranked her down all right so I don't know if you can see that or not there's a little tangy set screw in there that's what I just loosened up that's your handle and you can see there's kind of some crust going on there from that issues you've been having with the water there so this I think just pulls off you can see here maybe you can't maybe you can no you can't let me get you a little bit closer here so all on top of this spout here that's just all covered in water so I know there's no water up here on the top part of where that cartridge is so that's why I'm thinking it's the spout all rings so let's get to the next step here so with the cartridge kit they give you directions on how to do it he also sent me a separate PDF on how to change the old rings for the spout but like I said that that was pretty basic so on the very top here I know if you can see it there's like a knot that's got a you get loose' up they show using a adjustable I'm using the incorrect slip joint just because that's what I got in the garage and it's close I'm not sure what the exact size on that is but I'm sure you could put a regular wrench on there as well so you got the the nut there that you're gonna probably want to keep I'm assuming we reused that and then honestly I don't know what there's like a plastic ring or something on there look at the directions and see what they say so I don't I don't see anything in the directions about this which is odd but I know I think I've had this off well this will pull right out the cartridge that's that I knew but this plastic keeper here it is - we have to get that off oh I know why maybe that was in the spoke directions this plastic it's like a split washer there we go you don't want to break that because they don't give you one Lois that's what it looks like there's just the loops there you know it's just a split and that just kind of sits in there like a little crown now I believe if we did this right so cartridge if you're just changing that you don't even have to get into this and you just drop your new one in and you're on your way well they do give you a new knot ah look at that oops so I guess if you do use the wrong tool and maroc the threads or the top of the nut another one it really doesn't matter that's cool all right so now I believe if we did this correctly I just take the spout here and I should be able to pull the whole spoke up and off I guess is what it said or pull the whole sink right out of the counter one or the other I guess I don't see I don't see anything else holding that down I don't think this plastic part comes off okay so that's all that comes off probably a good idea to have some some towels around just so that you don't get water behind your sink there probably not a good place for it so if you saw that in a fast motion there you're just going to pull it off and may take some force so and then this is what that spot looks like on the inside here so you got a little bit of what you want to call that maybe that's grease it looks like they got some grease on the or rings maybe some like mineral buildup tool the way it kind of looks which shouldn't be the case or a water softener you the filtered water but so now we should have two old rings on here so yep there's a top all ring and there's a bottom one a lot of grease boy and it's just amazing that this Orion would be leaking here I suppose from the left and right use of the faucet it must kind of where that oaring down the new ones definitely look like they're pretty thick let's see if I can just pick it my finger if not I'll grab a picker actually you know what I got a small screwdriver in the house we'll use that alright so I'm doing this with all the wrong tools so don't don't do it this way use their a tools that is a pretty thick ordering so I'm just using this I glass screwdriver here which I shouldn't be using I should be using like a pick tool probably to get that off but it's cold outside so we will do it the quick way so oh yeah this holding definitely definitely got some wear on it there's some grooves on the outside of that o-ring I'm willing to bet that's why it leaks because if you look on the inside this o-ring is very nice and almost impossible door ring huh if I put it in my hand there yeah it's gonna be hard to see but there's some some grooves on the outside here and that's what the that's what the issue is it's gotta be so on there and then we got one on the bottom here and I might yeah this bottom one has where tool so there you go if your faucet starts leaking chances are these old rings are probably worn from your wife doing too many dishes I guess so invest in some paper plates and plastic silverware I guess so yeah this one's well this one almost looks like it's v-shaped that that would explain why it's leaking so we're gonna want to replace that there is some like little plastic keeper in the back here doesn't say anything about taking that out you probably want to make sure that you don't mess that up or lose that because I'm assuming that's integral to the faucet there so let me quickly check the directions to make sure I didn't miss anything here and we'll get back to it so the directions that you get in PDF form are in color which is kind of neat because it shows you step by step there is one thing it does say to clean it was like a toothbrush that's showing before you put that cartridge in so we'll have to make sure we do that there's that crown that I talked about then they got highlighted and orange two two o-rings that we just took off and then they show putting on crease now the grease has to be a special grease that does not deteriorate all rings it's usually called like a plumber's grease I believe so if if it didn't come with that that's what you need to have find that in the plumbing section and then they just show and I cleaning the inside of the spout as well so yeah we'll do that as well I planned I kind of cleaning it up and in grease and everything up so I will if I can I'll save this in I'll link this or put this in the comments or not the description or whatever on the video here so that everyone can use this because this this worked pretty well okay got the new o-rings out here yeah the old ones are definitely the shape from where Sol we're gonna put these on I'm assuming that's what the issue was hopefully that's what the issue was I did take a look in here that cartridge sits that's really clean there's no scrubbing maybe if you have like a lot of mineral deposits and stuff that would be an issue but I don't see anything like that I suppose this grease too is important to put on the o-rings because probably why they have an issue with them being the grease must wear away and then you have issues with it wearing out the o-ring for those that are interested the part number on the grease is nine nine nine one five so if for some reason you need a little tube of Bolan grease here looks like they give you plenty and I'm gonna use this probably pretty generously on here also when you put that all ring on you kind of want to make sure you don't roll it on and try to keep the shape of the bull ring very tacky grease and make sure that all ring is very well covered and we're looking for this bottom groove here I did off-camera kind of clean that clean that out because there's like a little bit of looks like grease in there so little boy everything's gonna get covered here in grease I don't know how I have no idea how I'm gonna get that order I don't want to pull this thing or if it'll be half doing but all right you got that one on definitely tight especially when the thing is covered with grease it makes it that much more difficult very sticky Greece though for that bottom one is tight enough here so you may want to take what you got left here in Greece maybe just put a thin layer on the outside kind of overdo it a little bit I don't know that's what I'm gonna do because that spoke came off pretty hard there was definitely some force so I don't think it's gonna hurt to have a little extra grease on there should help over time I would think they do do want to shout out the Moen because like I said I replaced this Moen the first time not knowing that there was a warranty because I didn't really read the fine print so it's really nice that they actually stand behind their product and it sounds like these where items still stand behind for the life life of the faucet which is good so I'm gonna pause here get the grease off my hands and then we'll put the spout on alright so a step that is not on their list is to soak your spout handle in a vinegar I know this door is just some small light deposits of calcium the way it look inside there and some minerals so we're just gonna soak that out right Luce anit up and then I'll probably clean that with like the wife's toothbrush or something okay to speed up the process I actually put that vinegar in the microwave and I heated it up I think I had it in there about three minutes so I didn't boil but I got pretty warm hopefully that'll help break up those deposits so alright I think we're we're getting close here let's get this thing put back together alright so we got the spoke all cleaned up here I'm gonna slide it on so we're actually forcing it over that first ol ring and then down or this other one so that's kind of why it goes difficult you want to make sure you enough grease on there because otherwise you could probably distort that ol ring and be right back where you started again the other thing I want to note is that hot vinegar that I got going I also I threw the spot handling because the inside of the the handle was all full of calcium stuff and deposits so we'll get that going as well I did clean this up off-camera just with some clear water and now we're gonna go hopefully just slide this straight over top here working it back and forth there it is nice I think I don't know it goes back and forth alright so next up is that little crown I'm gonna get that back back on there and I don't think that has any orientation you can adjust slide that back on the spout actually came off went on a lot easier than going off but I guess pushing it down so it makes it a little bit easier yeah I think this part too I'm gonna this little comb cover here that just kind of slides on I'm going to throw that in that hot vinegar and just let it soak a little bit okay so for the cartridge instructions it basically just showed you what I did taking off that spout there taking off the handle here's the little tiny set screw I'm not I'm not sure exactly why they have to send you a new set screw obviously this one's all gunked up because those old rings were leaking but they do and then the old cartridge here had grease on the top so the leftover grease I had I just did the same thing and I kind of I put some grease oops I put some grease in there as well so and for orientation for putting this cartridge in there's actually two recess areas in the back there and then there's one up in front so you can't put this in the wrong way you know it mean there's no I don't think you need to put any grease on the bottom here this is kind of word it seals up there's very tiny little like rubber surface here I want to say o-ring but it's probably not so that just kind of I know it just sticks in there and then you got your new nut that holds that cartridge down according to the directions that's just a matter of turning it down until it's hand tight and then it says to give it a quarter quarter degree turn or ninety ninety degrees and you're giving it a quarter I'm assuming if it leaks you give it a little bit more but I don't know it like I said those orange there's not much to them so I'll call that a eighth of a turn maybe a little a little bit more seems like it's still going that seems pretty snug wouldn't get carried away with that look at that so what I need do at this point is turn the water back on just to see if anything leaks instead of getting carried away in any way my stuff is kind of still soaking in that hot vinegar Brian we got going so I'm gonna go underneath the sink here turn the valves back on and we'll see what happens all right water is on I have not touched anything nothing's dripping out but it probably would be air locked anyway so let's just turn it on here and see what happens they have both the hot and the cold on both valves are turned on underneath the sink here I don't see anything leaking do it again here I don't know that I can I'm not gonna be able to turn this obviously cuz this there's not enough there and I'm not gonna put my players on that but if there's no water coming up here we think if you're gonna get it to leave this is on those o-rings this is where it has been leaking out it's coming off and filling up this cap area and then running down the bottom they actually wasn't coming out of the bottoms that's so nice it's really the little things so let me clean up the handle and that little cover and let's complete this whole thing alright so I got that cover all cleaned up one thing you note I think I misspoke here that crown there is an orientation to how that needs to go it's hard to tell but where it's split it needs to go come on needs to go in the back you know if you can see kind of in the middle of the screen there there's like a tab that sticks up if you don't have it in there that won't be sitting flat all the way in there's like a groove for all these little tabs sit in and like I said the split part needs to go towards the back if you don't have that in the back where it's split that won't sit in there then you won't be able to slide your chrome cover on see that should just snap right on if you're trying to force it on it doesn't seem to be going this this little ring here is not where it needs to be like I said the open part or split part of that needs to go towards the back I would say it's a 12 o'clock position so is that let me get the handle cleaned up and get it reassembled alright so I got the handle all cleaned up we're gonna put it on I may have misspoke a couple times saying spout instead of other things I don't know I'm just obsessed with the spout on this thing I don't know I almost called this the spot this is the handle the handle just kind of slides over the top and you can kind of rotate it back and forth and then if you recall they give us a new set screw with a little allen allen wrench here and it's got a little bit of thread Locker on and we're just gonna run that in and it doesn't give any torque spec for this but like I said I kind of just cranked it down once you get it to a point where you think it's pretty good flip your little tool around your little allen wrench and can really give it the bit of torque that it needs here if you can get it in there there we go I think that's probably plenty tight does have Loctite on it had a drip there from something else ways there don't see things brayer words you recall at this point you did have water leaking you know and there's nothing if you look at the base there's absolutely no water that's coming out there's nothing that's running out in there neither you could see it - if you look very carefully you could see water kind of building up last part is to throw a little tiny Miha cover or cap that covers that a little set screw in there solve them on faucets they may be red and blue I think our first faucet had a red and blue one this one's just chrome colored it's just a little piece of plastic that's kind of a friction fit and that's it that's the whole thing their sole one thing to know what or know if anybody caught it probably didn't didn't didn't catch it or couldn't see it I didn't have anything anything covered up so if I drop something it was probably going down the drain I didn't want to say anything until this point after I got everything put together because it's kind of nervous about that but yeah so that's your Moen faucet fix here just give them a call and like I said I'll include the instructions if I can get them in the description or whatever if I can upload that PDF I'll put it in there because that's it's pretty clear and how to do it and I think any bonehead can do it if I can do it any bone head can do it so there you go your Moen faucet fix", "h_jajjlqtV4": "hi there welcome to another one of my videos thank you for taking your time and watching them i also want to welcome other new youtube subscribers twitter followers and instagram followers to the family remember to click the subscribe button below to join the fam that way you don't miss out on any new episodes new giveaways and more let's get right to it on this video i'm going to tell you about the all glass 1 milliliter vape cartridges that i got from o2 vape dot com by delivery order i paid 40.99 for five of these cartridges i could have gotten one by itself for 9.99 but i can't do just one of anything this right here is the most beautiful coil system i have ever ever seen gravity does its job oil is absorbed by a ceramic coil and it vaporizes so flavorful on this beauty i have run at least six syringes through my main cart and it still hasn't clogged due to its design this is the cartridge side at the top even the paper pass is 100 glass too makes any oil tasted on this is the tank put together after the first fill as you can see once the oil had gone to the glass part of the cartridge i removed the blue phillip tool first and then i installed the coil on the cartridge by just screwing them together as usual we will start with the cons the first con i found was that learning how to fill the tank was a steep learning curve for me and i'm used to filling up tanks the syringes with the plastic tip in the end will need the little blunt tip extension that will fill it'll fill the card without spilling over that's the only issue i found with this tank as of now onto the pros because the design is all glass the tip never gets hot so i can use it all day long without ever burning my lips the flavor on these cards is amazing on every single hit no matter how much you use it through the day plus due to the coil design it doesn't take more than three to five hits in between strains to see the flavor change completely and cleanly they are super easy to clean if needed for example i spilled some oil into the vapor path while filling up the first one and i was able to just stick a q-tip dipped in alcohol in there to clean it right up i don't know what it is about being able to see right through the whole thing or being able to see the vapor path fill up and empty out as i hit it that just warms up my heart it makes me giddy inside too i can honestly say i had never up to this point in my life used a cartridge that didn't clog this one i haven't been able to clog it up yet that alone makes it the winner in my book then you add the flavor and how long they last come on now and as i sherry on top there is the savings from buying your oil and syringes instead of paying extra for the cards every time you need oil that right there turns in from a winner into a champion in my book i use these cards all day and night i hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "I4rsLT4mSN8": "this is a video on how to repair a single handle Moen faucet that a year ago this thing started to not close or not turn off properly and eventually after it broke off just like that and what there is there's a little plastic piece in here that breaks and so now we got to get this apart and repair it I ordered this off of Amazon it's a repair kit for ammo and fosston and it has all of the pieces that I guess break over time but I think that's the main one that breaks is that piece right there there's instructions that come with it but I haven't even looked at them to be honest but the way to get this apart is you gotta unscrew this piece and if it's tight you can get a wrench like a strap wrench to to grip it because you don't want to scratch it and then you have this and the problem I had it first without his like well I've got to get this piece out and I was and I was trying to and this just spun in it and the screw wouldn't spin out so what you have to do is you have to remove this piece which just kinda let's see it kinda well what we should do first is turn the water off okay I got the water off it's a good idea to get the water off because I had the problem of this thing I couldn't get the screw out and it just spun and spun so what I had to do is I had to lift up on it and then get a wrench in here to hold the thing because this will just spin well first you got to get this little black piece off that threads off like that and then there's this great piece and you with the water off you could pull it up and then you can lift up and if you look underneath you can see there's a little flat part that you can put a wrench on and that's what I had to do in order to get this screw out at the top is is get all this and get a wrench on it but the screw is loose now it's fun a little bit but it's loose enough now and this is the piece that broke and here's the new one that came in the kit and it broke you know it just snapped in half basically from years literally years this this has been installed for thirteen years but I have had trouble with it the last year this gray piece it's important that it has a raised rim and that faces towards the front of the faucet the handle just broke off but this piece actually comes out that's a piece that attaches that's actually what attaches to this piece so I'm gonna go ahead and snap the new one in there's a there's a deeper circle and you want to put the deep the deeper circle goes towards the stem down so I'm gonna snap it in place with that larger hole on the bomb there we go and then this goes on to here with there's a tiny screw hole here that the handle screws to and that and that screw hole is towards the front of the handle so it faces towards the front and I'm just gonna put that little plastic piece I'm gonna actually have to push the stem down back to the off position to the closed position and I'm gonna put this little actually I'm looking at it I have it turned to the to the left so I'm gonna take some needle nose pliers and actually pull up on it and turn it so that it's facing that flat part is facing to the front and now I'm gonna put this piece on here and I'm going to place the plastic piece over now this black piece will screw down you put that after you do that tighten that now maybe I should have put that on because I still have to put the screw in the top just screw it to the stem but Moen claims in the instructions that you don't have to turn the water off so I'm gonna tighten this in here is spinning I'm gonna take this black piece back off and actually pull up on it yeah there's actually I just noticed there's a hole right here that you can stick something in to hold that stem steady while you tighten the screw at the top so I'm gonna grab something to put in there okay I found this is just a file but that hole I'm gonna stick a file in it and then I'm gonna use a Phillips screwdriver to tighten while I hold the stem steady it does I guess it's that but I used the new screw that came in the kit and it must have had the thread lock must have made it tight pretty tight that's pretty good I don't think maybe I'll try again a I'm afraid of getting it off-center but it doesn't seem to be really moving once I have this bar in here yeah that's pretty snug so now I'm gonna I'm gonna tighten that put that gray piece back down on there I'm gonna thread this back on there and oh wait I forgot the black piece this black piece goes on now this piece and this piece be careful that you don't cross thread it because it's the threads are plastic so they probably could tear up pretty easily now the handle goes on with this allen screw this screw that I'm putting in this is the old one but it's just it's just an Allen screw that attaches the handle to that metal piece which is attached alright it looks like it's working you turn to the left you turn to the right there's a cap that goes on this alright okay I got the water turned back on and I'm gonna test it out now that should be the center right there and then that should be hot I do feel it's getting warmer to the right could be cold definitely is cold there's two valves underneath that I turned off but that basically is there and originally I thought that maybe the packing and the stem was bad or the you know whatever the valve that you know that that directs the water was bad but really what what was bad was just that little plastic piece that that broke inside and it actually worked for a while with the with the plastic piece probably halfway broking I don't know but but it's fixed now thanks for watching", "n4mnfadLwJ8": "[Music] hi this is Mike haver thanks for asking me is possession of a THC vape pen cartridge a felony there's a big difference between marijuana and marijuana resins marijuana is a plant it grows in nature and while it can be intentionally grown and genetically engineered still it's not considered man-made on the other hand resins weather ink oil dabs wax shad or whatever you want to call them they are man-made Albea from a plant and marijuana resins are almost always designed to be significantly more potent than any natural marijuana plant could ever be in florida possession of under 20 grams of marijuana in plant form is a misdemeanor yet possession of any amount of resin is generally treated as a felony the way that the laws applied is clear but the law itself at present is not without getting too technical as of today and I'm sure this is going to change FS 893 point 13 the statute designating marijuana as a controlled substance in Florida does not identify THC resins so there's no statutory distinction between marijuana and resin however our florida standard jury instructions do differentiate THC resins are specifically excluded from any in all marijuana instructions thus the different treatment by cops and prosecutors setting these technical issues aside a clever defense attorney may be able to get your THC resin charge dropped from a felony down to a more manageable misdemeanor and thereby reducing your exposure from 5 years in prison and a $5,000 fine to a mere 364 days and $1,000 fine just hire the right lawyer and you'll likely get the best result by the way never forget to question how it was in the first place that the cops came upon your cartridge there may well be a Fourth Amendment challenge in your case for an illegal search and seizure that said I thank you for your question I appreciate your having asked it and I invite you to ask me more please remember that at Haber PA it's all about reasonable doubt and if you like this video then subscribe we'll be putting out more sin [Music] [Applause]", "p4XiAKruMzY": "The first faucet we are going to repair is\ngoing to be this Delta. Before we get started on this repair, we\u00edre\ngoing to want to shut off this water so you are going to want to get down below this faucet,\nopen up the cabinet doors to your sink. You are going to want to trace from the hot\nand cold side of this faucet the two lines that come down and they are going to go to\nwhat they call stops. Stops are going to have handles on them that\nyou are basically going to turn to the right to shut the water down. Just remember, righty\ntighty, lefty loosie. Turn to the right, tighten down those stops, to shut off the water. Now we are ready to make the repair so back\nto the tool that I talked about. It\u00eds got an Allen wrench head on top of it. You know\nwhat, if you don\u00edt have this tool, we can always use these.\nDelta just happens to incorporate it into its tool so what we\u00edre going to do is pull\nthis handle back and that is where our set screw is located \u00d6 if the spout is in your\nway you can just move it to one side or the other. You\u00edre going to insert the key and back that\nAllen screw out. All that\u00eds doing is pulling that Allen screw\naway from the stem that the handle is attached to. Once we undo that set screw, this handle is\ngoing to lift off and we\u00edre going to set this aside. Now we come down to this decorative cap. That\u00eds\nso you don\u00edt see the heart and soul of the faucet through this handle. So this cap is\njust going be put on hand tight. We\u00edre going to unscrew this cap. Take it off and set it\naside. Now we have a brass nut that holds this stem\nin place The channel locks that we talked about earlier you are going to want to adjust\nthose to the correct size. The shoulders right here on the nut, you are\ngoing to want to put your channel locks right onto there. Now you have a hold of your channel locks\nhold onto the bottom of your faucet and undo this nut. Once this nut comes loose, you\u00edre going to\nwant to back it all the way off and lift it up. Alright, now that we\u00edve got the nut off that\nactually holds the stem in place and now we\u00edve got our cartridge. This is what is causing\nthe problem and this is what we are trying to repair.\nSo, we lift that cartridge out, and you can tell this is a new cartridge but when you\npull your cartridge out, you can see these O rings down here they may have calcium and\nlime built up around them. There may be little cuts in there. Anything\nthat comes through your water line can get on top of here and score these. This is where\nyour hot and your colds come in. You move your cartridge and that mixes it and allows\nyour tempered water to come out. You\u00edre going to note that there are two feet\nbuilt on to the bottom of your cartridge. There\u00eds two sockets down there that these\nfeet set in \u00d6 so when you go to your Westlake Hardware store and show them what kind of\ncartridge you have they are going to give you this identical piece and you are going\nto come back and it\u00eds pretty foolproof because all you have to do is put those little feet\nright back in those same holes. So you\u00edll set that cartridge back in there\nand the feet will set in place. You can tell because now you can\u00edt turn that cartridge\nleft or right. We\u00edre going to go back and reassemble the\nfaucet just the same way we took it apart. So that nut is going to go in there and it\u00eds\ngoing to pull down. Now these nuts, you make them up hand tight and you will want to go\nback to your adjustable pliers or channel locks. Hold onto the faucet and just snug this up.\nThere are O rings and seals that are built into this cartridge that hold water from coming\nup thru here so this joint right here doesn\u00edt hold water it\u00eds holding this cartridge down\nso the water can\u00edt seep past it. So once you have that nut tightened up, you\u00edre\ngoing to want to put that decorative ring back on and make it up. Remember this goes\non hand tight, you don\u00edt want to use your channel locks as you don\u00edt want to mar the\nsurface. Now we\u00edre ready for our handle. Once you\nput your handle back on that Allen wrench will hit one of these flat spots, So what\nwe\u00edre going to do, we\u00edre going to line up the stem with the hole in the handle. Now that we\u00edre on, we know our flat spot\nis facing this way so we want our Allen wrench to come out the front. We will slide our spout\nout of the way a little bit. We will take our Allen key or our hex key\nand tighten this back up. Right there, you have just saved yourself a lot of money and\nyou\u00edve done your stem repair. Now that we\u00edve made our repair on our Delta,\nwe\u00edre going to jump to our Moen. The Moen has an Allen screw in the back of the handle\nopposite of what the Delta is. We\u00edre going to grab ahold of our Allen wrenches\nand we\u00edre going to have a different assortment and if you look in the back you are going\nto see approximately what size that head is. I\u00edm going to guess it\u00eds this one right here. We\u00edre going to slide in the back of the handle\nand loosen up that set screw. Once you get that set screw loose, lift that\nhandle off. Set it to the side. We\u00edre going to have a decorative ring that also comes\noff here, and remember, don\u00edt use your channel locks as you\u00edre going to scar the finish. So we\u00edre going to unscrew and set it aside.\nAnother shouldered nut here, we\u00edre going to use the adjustable channel locks. Set it\non there, turn the nut, loosen it, now we will take it off rest of the way by hand.\nSet this nut to the side and now we\u00edve accessed this cartridge. They have two feet on the\nbottom of this cartridge \u00d6 you cannot screw that cartridge up. It\u00eds got to be put in\none direction. So you\u00edre going to notice there are holes in the bottom of the faucet. When you pull this cartridge off you might\nhave calcium or lime built up on it. Once you go down to your Westlake Hardware store,\nyou\u00edre going to come back with a cartridge and you are going to set it back in the same\nway. Those feet are going to set in those slots. It won\u00edt allow it to turn. You are going to take the nut again, use your\nchannel locks just to snug it. Tighten that handle up. There you\u00edve just\nmade your repair on your Moen faucet.", "_xp08_8-QWk": "today on the rugged homestead we're going to be changing the filter in our drop-in water filtration system that we have mounted underneath the kitchen sink hi this is rich with the rugged homestead and we have a basic water filtration system for tap water on our kitchen sink and every six months you need to change out the filter because it builds up with the particulates that it filters out so that's our chore for today I'm actually a month behind on it I try and do it on the first of January and the first of July so here it is at the end of January and as I said a little bit behind with changing it out it's actually a very simple process the filter is made by whirlpool and what it goes into it through the filter it's a charcoal filter and comes out the other end and out the tap add the sink this is the filter here you see drop-in filter system from whirlpool and what this is good for it reduces the chlorine taste and odor from the water reduces amount of sediment that you'll get in water less for six months as I said and it's a point five microns I believe eyes aren't as good as they used to be so this is its basic filter system there's a lot better out there and actually what I'd like to have is a berkey water filtration system that you can basically take mud and put in and have pure drinking water come out the other end those are pricey alternatives in the meantime I've got this as I said it's basic and it's better than nothing so here we go I'm going to go over to the sink and start changing out that filter okay the first thing we're going to do is to shut off the cold water inlet into the filter system but just turn this down and that was shut off of course there's going to still pressure in the line so that red button back there you press that button and that releases the pressure in the filter now the filter is still filled with water so just to catch anything that drips and if they're just a small plastic container and put it underneath the filter so that we don't have a wet mess underneath the cabinet here the next thing that we do is the filter came with a wrench that fits over the housing of the filter and allows you to unscrew it easily never does seem to be enough room underneath a kitchen sink there we go that we can under threat it by hand unscrewing the housing now show you what the filter looks like so the top is discolored we have a drop-in replacement cartridge here which slightly better color to it let me take that we just slide it right back into the housing slide this back on and begin tightening and as you can hear it's a good thing we have that container with a nice catch the bubbler that's dripping down put the wrench back on slide it up and then we tape it back into place we're good turn our back on get here filling back up and we're good to go for another six months if you like what you see give the video a thumbs up subscribe to the channel and leave a comment down below thanks for watching", "TNIr2X6KiqM": "all right try to look online to try and work out how to change the washer so to speak in these sort of taps because the tap was leaking to know about but we did find actually not to know about but we did find something online more pictures in a video and it was quite awful but I thought there's nothing on YouTube so we thought we'd upload something so hopefully you can help some people out in changing these it's a cartridge that's in the hot side here once you see the video you'll find it's quite easy what you need to do first is come down here make sure you turn the tap off now you need to turn the main off just turn it up under the sink back turn these up to turn the tap on nothing cold or hot and you can move on to moving this handle first side a bit looser than others as you can see comes out there's a grub screw here and from memory is enough a memory here is a three mil okay so oh it's actually smaller so 2.5 so go ahead and remove that you can see just twist it we've already replaced this so when you see the cartridge coming out it's actually the new one I've already put in it releases all the way out which is your grub screw side that comes off this piece here you twist off and okay pause right back again so I forgot to get a ship that you see the big nut there just go ahead and listen it see that there I put a bit of teflon tape on there just be on the safe side you see they don't screws on there is your cartridge two holes they locate inside there you can only go in one way and if you can see them and up but this is easy as it is put that back in as you can see doesn't turn so let's locate it they push back in tight them up you don't need to put a massive amount of pressure on it just enough to nip it up put your ring back on put that back on there look you grab screw back on obvious leave it there Ellen key part are facing up later mother give a bit of a nip up again and again handle back on time go ahead and work turn your taps back on put in we're liking it out too", "AipEYoYiIhc": "just call Henry lush plumbing eating an air $825 in the big chair henry blue salami hi and thank you for visiting Henry Bush plumbing here in smooth on the web my name is Wes Livingston and I'm a service manager here at Henry Bush Plumbing Heating and Air Conditioning today we're going to be repairing one of the most common faucets on the market the Delta single lever ball style faucet this Delta style valve can be found in Delta kitchen faucets lavatory faucets and share our valves now where all the parts might be for the most part the same some are different such as the case of the metal handle that we have here today and those faucets that use the acrylic handle such as this one here today we'll be repairing the kitchen faucet keep in mind that the parts for the lavatory faucet and the shower valve will be virtually the same the parts are we working with today are our seats springs spout or rings cam and cam washer the delta ball and some stem-loop to help things move more freely now you can purchase these items in parts here at our parts counter or you can purchase them at your local parts dealer home center keep in mind that's if you can find somebody to help you okay let's talk about the tools right now we're going to begin with a smooth jaw adjustable wrench the 1/8 inch allen wrench / Delta tool and then our oring pick to remove the and reinstall the new o-rings this is sometimes referred to as the dental pick now keep in mind with our smooth jaw wrench we want to get a wrench that has no teeth as the teeth on any wrench which Mar the faucet that is the chrome finish of the faucet now with any faucet repair the first thing you want to do is turn the water off with the kitchen faucet or lavatory faucet cure up valves are usually right underneath the sink turn those valves off and you're good to go with a shower valve turn the valve off outside named water coming into the home and you're good to go confirm that the water is off by opening up a hose dip can make sure that that water has stopped flowing before doing any type repair on your shower now as is with all faucet repairs we want to make sure that the water we've turned off is in fact off we can do this if we by opening the handle no flow water is confirmed off well next step let's get into the repair we're going to start by taking our 1/8 inch allen wrench Delta tool and we're going to or handle up and you'll see right underneath there we have our Allen screw this is the school we're going to be loosening up so that we can remove the handle so that we can access the rest of the parts of the faucet here next step we're going to be removing the cap assembly we'll do that by using our adjustable wrench again this is a smooth draw wrench as we're not we don't want to scar the finish of the product once we get semi loose we can set the adjustable wrench down and finish removing the cap assembly by hand now that we've removed the cap assembly next we want to remove the cam assembly the cam washer and the ball assembly underneath you'll see the seats and spring we'll be removing this as you can see with our dental pick and lastly we want to remove our spout we remove the spout because in order to access the spout o-rings oh yeah you see we have either sit there with the Delta as you see we have two o-rings which we're removing now I'm using the dental tool to help me remove those just mix it a little bit easier now we'll start by taking the two o-rings that we talked about earlier and installing those bond to the new valve body using our dental tool to help guide the o-rings on you wanna make sure that those o-rings fit into the grooves where the o-rings need to be getting our second o-ring and again making sure that it fits into the groove next we want to take our stem loop and install it onto the o-rings so that that spout does move freely take a little bit of extra grease putting it on to the spout itself now the two locations where the o-rings make contact with a spout reinstall the spout assembly that's it for the spout assembly next we want to take our new seats in our new Springs start off with one spring and one seat I like using my dental tool to help guide the hope the seat and spring into place falls down there and I take my index finger and kind of push it into place there that's as far as it goes for now we'll take the second seat in spring and duplicate that process again using the dental tool as a guide let that slide into place using my index finger I can remove the dental tool and now finish centering that seat and spring into place that seat and spring is now in place I'm gonna take a little bit of that stem loop and put a little bit of it on the ball where the seats make contact with the ball I'm going to install the new ball along with the new cam washer and take another little bit of stem Lube putting it on the cam wash where makes contact with the ball and the teflon seal there can their and the cap assembly and one thing you'll see here I'm making sure that this white guide here lines up with the notch that's inside the valve body once that's in place I can take my cap assembly here with Mennonite singer down I put it down and hold down my cap assembly so what it stays in that groove and now I simply screw the cap nut into place tighten as far as you can by hand and then take your adjustable wrench and finish tightening it the rest of the way until it's snug that feels snug to me now what are we looking for as far as snug we want to make sure that we have a good stiff feel from the ball and the reason we're looking for that is to prevent any leakage from around the stem here of the ball feels good to me next step we're going to reinstall the handle assembly taking our 1/8 inch Delta allen tool and tightening it to the stem of the Delta ball that being tight I'm going to turn the valve into the opposition and go turn the water back on to the faucet now that we finish the repair and we've turn the water back on before we turn the faucet back on here I want to remove the aerator so that any debris that may have worked loose in the process of turn the water on and off will flow through freely we can do this simply by turn the water on at the faucet hot and cold to confirm that all the debris is been removed turn the valve off reinstall your aerator and guess what you've just fixed your faucet well we did it we repaired the faucet and remember for this repair any plumbing repair we're always just a phone call away 24 hours a day seven days a week at one 825 plumber and for detailed instructions on this

recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "Lok3M6al86Y": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoffman ring officer of honey stick and today I am serving up a nice platter of oil pens for you one of the most commonly frequently asked questions that I get personally and the rest of my service staff get is how do I choose my perfect oil pen and based on the successes of our other videos about how to pick your perfect concentrate and dab pen and also how to pick your perfect concealer well we really worked hard on this week was trying to put together a comprehensive checklist and run through our units to see how you can pick out your perfect oil pen so what our team did we put these factors together and then I did a job job of going out into our warehouse and assembling all of the various units that we have as options for oil pens that we felt viable and we're gonna run through them all based on our eight criteria that I've outlined so let's jump into my criteria I outline and I'm gonna rely on the audience of course to drop into the comments if there's a criteria that I forgot so people who are tuned into the video following along watching the comments can really still see and make the best informed decision that's what our videos are about is really presenting our products and just helping you guys to make a better purchasing decision or to just get a little more education awareness so let's jump into my eight factors my first factor when choosing an oil pen I think is based on the availability based on your state now oils are not necessarily accessible everywhere so it might not even be an option for you but in the event that it is some states they're only have it seemed to be available already prefilled into 510 threaded cartridges or they could be placed into so Changez already pre Lord or they can only be available in tincture bottles so based on what kind type of oils you have access to or what type of texture oils you have access to could really be a determining factor of when you when you're trying to select your perfect oil pen the next factor for you is to keep in mind and I think it's a second probably the most pressing factor is budget I know there's a lot of eight ballers out there who price is not a thing but a lot of medical patients and people who are on let's say disability or things like that that are using cannabis for medicinal purposes budget is a very important thing to them so we can't just go crazy on the price spectrum and we should definitely keep a price as a major factor when choosing a vaporizer as an option the next factor that I think is the most important is how stealthy the unit is so stealthiness can play play a factor in a few ways whether you have it on the go and you want to be discreet whether you just want to be small and compact or whether you are really taking your vaporizer places that you shouldn't and you just don't want to get caught or you want it to go incognito which is perfectly cool but that definitely plays a factor when you are choosing your perfect vape pen I think the next next factor number four is the ease of use is how easy is the oil pen to use and really what is your vape level I have a lot of people who have never turned on a vaporizer before who contact us and we have people who call in to educate us on our own vaporizers on how the best way is to use them so there's different places where you can fall in your vape knowledge spectrum and those will definitely have an impact on your buying decision when you are selecting your pur Victor oil pen is how easy is the vaporizer to use where's my current vape skillset or how am I willing to learn now we do try to make educational videos so that you know even if you do pick up one of the more more expert level vaporizers you know you watch our videos will walk you through how to get it up and running and really be able to use it next I think is battery life you know that comes into play when for me personally like when I'm buying a phone because I cannot stay connected to a charger you know certain people have certain lifestyles they take them on that or they can't get to a charger it takes a they want to be able to have a few days charge on it or they're going on a hiking expeditions is something we've gotten to where they want to make sure they can go about a week without having a charger so the battery life really does play into when you're making a decision of how long and how much you can use it in between charges I think that's important factor when choosing an oil pen next I think it is mobility is can you take it around or is it just gonna be something that kind of stays at home because generally you can get more power and performance out of units that are larger and you can get more kind of back to our other point of of being convenient and easy to use or stealthy out of smaller units so I think that really the mobility factor does play into it as to how and where you plan to take the vaporizer can you drop it in your pocket do you put in your backpack can you just you know throw it on a lanyard or keychain and call it a day next I think it comes down to the next factor really we're going into the nitty-gritty here is the power how much power puts out how intense it is I think that makes a big big determining factor to people because some people really thrive to get an intensity and powerful vaporizer that hits hard and to some people that's believe it or not that that can also be a turn-off to her they want a vaporizer to be very smooth and and and not you know be have any type of traits that to some people could lead off as harsh and I think in the last one is flavor everybody loves to taste good flavor when you're buying spending a lot of money buying concentrates or CBDs or whatever it is that you're buying a nateing sure surrender prefilled cartridge everybody wants to taste what they're getting fact is they're not they're not cheap and people want to get a unique and flavorful experience so where they rank on a flavorful level is also very important when choosing a royal pen so now that we've gone through all the factors and again if I miss something a really thought hard to try not to but if we did make sure to drop in the comments below so people can can see exactly what what other factors they should consider is let's jump right into our different assortment of oil vaporizers and start basically ranking them so you guys have a good knowledge and awareness of where these would rank first off we're a gold or honey stick oil disposable pen now I grab this has had some prefilled CBD in it some a gold lined CBD from our warehouse this pen ships empty so in terms of what you have available whether you if you don't have tinctures or syringes available this is not a 5-10 thread cartridge so you cannot unscrew this cartridge and screw your own cartridge in there so if in your state you only have prefilled cartridges this pen might not be for you however if you have tinctures and syringes available in your state you can definitely use this pen in terms of budget wise this pen is very cost effective because it is a disposable it's not recharged I think it's on our website for $15 so it's very convenient however on the same budget side it's not that economical because once you run through the tanks you would have to buy a new one and once you've ran through two three four of these you could have bought a rechargeable pen and price saved a little money in the wrong long run but if you're traveling or you live that certain lifestyle to where you don't want to take care of a pen maintain a pen you just want it to go through the tank or the the tincture or the syringe then this pen does definitely become convenient in terms of stealthy it's not stealthy in the sense of hiding the pan or the cartridge but it is stealthy in the sense that it looks similar to a lot of illiquid units and it can be disguise' belit is relatively small I mean it's basically about four and a half maybe five inches in length you can easily fit it into your pocket each one comes with a plastic tube and we did do a full review on this oil disposable pen it's actually very easy to use you just unscrew the top to fill it and we do have a step-by-step on there and there's no buttons to push no locking mechanisms you just inhale in terms of battery life this battery is good to run through the tank I tell people it is you should only really rely on it to run through the tank once even if the battery is not completely dead you don't want to get caught refilling the tank and then having to try to siphon or salvage oil out of a disposable pen because then you do have wastage and it is expensive so these they generally say are good for 200 puffs or one tank which if you look at the number of puffs on a half a mil which is the capacity of this tank it's between 150 and 200 puffs so that's what the battery life is mobility this thing is very mobile very convenient for traveling running around it's small it is extreme lightweight.you basically you could have a real lanyard and not even feel that it's here in terms of power that this unit doesn't have a high output this is more focused on smoothness and flavor it is auto draw and in general and again I say this is in general push-button units tend to hit harder than auto draw units simply because you're not using the power of your actual draw to activate the unit so this is a very flavorful a ceramic heating core and it it is not super intense it is more of a very smooth rolling and flavorful hits so that's where our disposable oil pan ranks one really select your perfect oil pan it is convenience oriented it is lightweight mobile flavorful but isn't going to deliver those those hard hits it's not rechargeable and it will not work with 510 threaded cartridges so let's move right along to one step up now this is not a unit that we have on our website however a lot of you guys have seen these these are the stylist standard disposable units this one we make exclusively for one of our distributors it's called the honey stick bee buzzin it is a stylus battery that comes with a high quality classic plastic wick cartridge what's cool about this stylus pen is it's basically the next step up from just plain disposable a lot of people do view these pens as disposable even though it is rechargeable in terms of availability this no matter what type of oils you have available whether it's prefilled cartridges or whether it's tinctures or syringes you can if you buy this kit you're able to use it because it does have a 5-10 thread battery that cartridges can screw on to however these auto draw batteries are not the modernized drawers like in the elf so if you're a cartridge is a high-capacity ceramic cartridge or a really wide cartridge battery could be a little underpowered in terms of budget price these pens retail for about twenty to twenty-five dollars they are their simple easy to use there's a very budget kit it's a very budget starter kit it is auto draw you know and with this carry case on our next level it is pretty stealthy because you just have in this little wallet case slip it into your pocket and you're not gonna hear or say anything about but once you have the the actual cartridge and the battery screwed on you know that that stealthiness kind of does go away now this cartridge is very similar to the cartridge that we have stock in our beekeeper unit and we have a detailed video on how to to fill this unit how to fill this year and up and it is actually very easy to fill up and to function there's no buttons there's no clicking there is no unlocking you just simply fill up the cartridge screw it onto the battery and your ready to vape it is an auto draws very easy to use battery life battery life for a rechargeable unit it probably does fall on the lowest end of the spectrum of our comparison it is basically about the same battery life if not less than our disposable unit so this thing it is you are gonna need to charge it more if you're on the go when it is charged up it's definitely gonna give you some good hits you're gonna run good with it but it is it is really the entry-level unit if you're just getting into vaping don't know of vaping z' for you you want to pick up a nice cost-effective kit that is gonna be easy for you to get started with just to see if you like vaping but it's not you know gonna be your daily driver or your long hauler mobility with the carrying case and even without it's a very lightweight it is a mobile we unit so you're gonna be able to run around with it you know it's it's a very small compact it is a little bit taller than our previous unit by about an inch with the cartridge on there and power this is an auto draw unit and it does have a more basic cartridge which has a wick so in terms of power they're not going to be that powerful when you when you draw you're not gonna get monster clouds because first of all it's not push-button second of all is because it's more of a traditional cartridge however it is very reliable of a unit now in terms of flavor again these kits were not knocking them at all we do make them they're very entry level in terms of flavor I don't think that you will get blown away you would have to switch it out to a different cartridge if you have very high quality extracts then I would probably consider upgrading the cartridge or stepping into a different level of a kit but very basic very good way to get started very easy to use lightweight a starter kit on that end all right next up our upgrade from our disposable pen we have our Gold Line vape battery okay which is a push-button variable temperature battery we did a very thorough review of this and it is actually paired up with our cloud tank here what's cool about this batteries it's 510 thread it works with all 510 thread batteries and also if you purchase this cartridge you can definitely take advantage of tinctures and syringes so in terms of what's available in your state if you buy one of these you're basically covered on all your ends in terms of budget this tank goes for I think $12 on our website and the the battery is $20 so it's actually your under $35 for this starter kit the way that it is and for that price you are getting a lot of bang for the buck because you are getting a very good battery it has three different temperatures it has preheat mode you know also chargeable very good we did a full detailed review of this pen if you want to see the features and specs it is actually very easy to use however because it's push-button it adds you know one level over the auto draw units that we just discussed here so you would definitely have to have some very basic vape knowledge but again this knowledge is very basic nothing to get freaked out about battery life this unit has a high-capacity battery it has a 650 mah battery so it is actually a very high capacity battery for a little vaporizer which is actually more than twice the the capacity of this so if you're looking for something more on-the-go and something that is definitely going to go to need less charges this is is a better unit option for that in terms of mobility it is a little bit long but it's still relatively light can still fit into your pocket still very transportable light enough to hold on a lanyard but it is a little bit long in terms of mobility in terms of power it has three intensity settings so you can hone in on what power you feel comfortable with so if you're not sure what you're gonna like it's definitely a good idea to have something that has variable temperatures and on the most intense setting a lot of our customers even have commented on the YouTube channels of of this pen that it hits really solid so for a small pen it definitely delivers the power if you pair this with not somebody else's prefilled tank you're filling your own you pair it with our cloud tank with a ceramic heater you're definitely gonna get good flavor so I really think that where does this pen rank in terms of an oil pen I think if you're looking for a beginner pen on a budget you cannot go wrong with this pen and it is a deftly a solid choice and the first step to get into the big leagues now let's move on to our most popular vaporizer that's being sold as the honey stick beekeeper it is a concealer so it is it's also been ranked by a lot of people as one of the best oil pens and the cartridge it comes with is a thick oil similar to the disposable very basic because most people do utilize 510 threaded cartridges it works on magnet adapter we have a very detailed video about this this this unit so because it does come with a tank you can use it for basically everything from tinctures to syringes and also 510 thread tanks that you could screw the magnet adapter on so no matter what your state has going on if you pick up a beekeeper more than likely you're gonna be able to take advantage of that it's pretty cost effective unit its selling on our website for 39.99 so it really isn't a big high-dollar unit and it delivers a lot stealthiness the concealer unit because it keeps the cartridge concealed it is actually very small as you can see here it definitely ranks very high on the stealth factor nobody really knows what's going on on top of it all it's a matte black looking like a stealth bomber I think it ranks very high in that level ease of use there's no variable temperatures there's one small button that's push button five clicks on five clicks off push and hold while you inhale super easy to use you can see our detailed video on that battery life this unit also has a high capacity battery which is just about twice the capacity of of these standard batteries so you're definitely going to be able to take this on the go more and get more out of it mobility I don't think you have a much more mobile unit to carry around it'll fit into your little jean pocket wherever slide into a little bitty groove into the purse it's not much bigger than a little thing of lipstick so in terms of power the beekeeper definitely does deliver power it doesn't have variable intensity sync so if you don't like a larger volume inhale you know you can't adjust it down real so it has a good power spectrum that delivers nice power if you're looking for flavor I really highly recommend you buy the high-performance beekeeper cartridge which has a wickless ceramic heater in it and it definitely brings out a lot more flavor notes and smoothens it out if you're filling your own cartridge and if you put your Magna dap tour on there it just drops in it even has a very cool stainless steel tip alright so now we're moving right along to our elf unit we just got done going over the beekeeper so the elf has basically a lot of the same characteristics in the sense that it's a very small actually a little bit smaller than the beekeeper concealer that works well with but that's a magnetic that works well with prefilled cartridges tinctures as well as fills a notable differences is the elf already comes with high performance good tasting ceramic cartridge so you can get a little bit more performance out of the stock elf cartridge it's glass then the stock beekeeper cartridge that that one comes with however a notable difference is they have the same battery capacity but this one is actually easier to use because it is buttonless so you don't have to unlock anything it is an auto draw unit now even though a lot of times Auto draw units are less powerful a lot of people have set the elf is actually a very powerful auto draw unit because the sensitivity of the sensor when you start drawing so you're still gonna get good power you're gonna get better flavor the unit is actually very stealthy it's a little bit easier to use if you're just getting started you don't like pushing small buttons a lot of people say they're medical medical condition doesn't let them to to push small buttons so it's very easy to draw the unit is very mobile has good power and because the high performance cartridge you do to a little bit of extra flavor out of it so this is also another good concealer now if you looked at the if you determine that hey I need a concealer based off of you know the characteristics that we went through our eight important factors but you want something that has a little bit more or has a little bit more battery power your next step up is our phantom unit which our phantom unit is basically a concealer as you could see it's very similar in size it's a little bit bigger but the reason it's a little bit bigger is it has two and a half times the battery capacity of the elf and the phantom so you're gonna go a lot more between charges it's also squeeze action so it's you're not pushing any small buttons however were the key differences is that it has four different temperature settings so you can really tune in on that power and flavor level that you want it comes with a high performance cartridge and what's cool is it also comes with I don't have it here on the table actually I do it even comes with a wax adapter cartridge so if the availability of prefilled cartridges oils that you can fill aren't there but waxes are you have the wax adapter as well so it really allows you to be very very versatile when you're using the phantom it's a very cool looking unit feels very good extremely stealthy because you can't see the cartridge still small but it does have more power more capacity and it has a four available temperature settings on here again we have a couple very in-depth videos about this year on the channel so if you're a going concealer this is probably where you're gonna be however it does cost more it is our most expensive concealer that we have over here which on our website think it's about 129 on here but really solid unit just you can feel the quality so if you're not sure if you want something like a stick a battery or concealer and you want something in between and you're really trying to get the vaporizer into places a vaporizer shouldn't be we have our minimax Pro which is a switchblade action key fob battery which will does not come with a cartridge the elf phantom and the beekeeper all come with their cartridges so if your state or your availability doesn't have 510 thread cartridges you will need to buy a cartridge to pair this with in order to get it functioning it is not that expensive of a unit it retails on our website for $40 it is pretty easy to use it does have three temperature settings but it only has one button here that you push so you'd have to unlock it and relock it and cycle through the temperatures through here what is cool about it is that it does have a pretty high capacity battery it has a 650 million power battery so it does actually have more capacity than the elf and the beekeepers so it falls kind of right in between these two units in terms of battery life the thing about it is though is it is extremely stealthy because it was designed like a car key it even fits on your keyring so it's extremely mobile so you can see the cartridge hides over here and you push the button and it flips open so you keep it completely hidden this is where the key would be I mean this thing is gonna fly under the radar basically wherever you have it as long as you pair it with your wallet or have it on your keychain because the three power levels that it has you can wind up the intense and you can get some really good power rips out and I know some people posted reviews on our in-depth video about this product and they said that on the third power level they will have able to get some really good strong power and depending on what cartridge you pair it with if you have it paired with like a cloud tank like our cloud tank on our website that has a good smooth ceramic flow your also get some really good flavor notes out of it so this little unit if you're really stealthiness is super important to you but you still want to have some good features in there and stay keep a pen that's you know under $50 pad your you're looking pretty good with the minimax Pro for your oil needs so we just went over all these regular oil and cartridge devices now I want to take take the next step to jump into a new level of vaporizer which is our sub ohm I have a video that really goes into sub ohm and oil vaping and I really truly do believe it as a future trend a lot of customers do ask me hey what if I just buy the most expensive pen is it the best pen or not well the short answer is generally the most expensive pens are better and more performance but it still might not fit your personal 8 characteristics that we went through as good as some of the other pens but the sub ohms are our favorite they're one of our fastest growing areas and honey stick is really one of the best innovators in this area so let's start off if you like the concealer but you want a sub ohm we have our old unit the Ripper which we actually have the new one here's the shell of it I don't have a finished unit because they are gonna be delivered this week so just a couple more days guys I know a lot of people put in their pre-orders and the new version is actually gonna look just like this really cool shell and it's gonna be a two in one it's actually gonna have a wax adapter as well but the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer so now just really really quickly what a sub ohm unit does is it just brings really low resistance really high power and intensity and what I would say is much greater flavour notes to oils and I put up a video about sub ohm oil vaping and we've reviewed a lot of our sub ohm devices now the Ripper is your sub ohm concealer it does not work with 510 thread cartridges so if you only have 510 thread cartridges in your state this is probably not a vaporizers that you're gonna pick up because you either need tinctures or syringes but it is actually disguised to look as a lighter you flip it open you have your button you know it has it has a telescopic mouthpiece that comes out here and we will have a full review of a ripper when it's in stock it only has one temperature setting which is in tense however this unit is extremely stealthy a lot of people have confused it as a lighter it's very easy to use because it doesn't have any digital settings it's not variable temperature it's just a 5 click lock and because the lock is covered you don't even really have to keep it locked the the cartridges just pop in and out which you do have to fill because they are subohm they just pop in and the top screws on it's a very simple extremely durable mechanism it does have an ultra high-capacity battery which actually has about 20% more capacity than even our phantom so very high-capacity battery it's extremely mobile extremely durable very tough unit and on the power scale it is off the charts in terms of intensity you can YouTube some videos of people using this device in terms of flavor I feel it has better flavor than most cartridges however when we get down into our digital mods and tanks you can really fine-tune the flavor so I think in subohm in the sub own category it has better flavor than a lot of standard units however because of all the power and because you can't really fine-tune it in it's definitely higher on the power and intensity spectrum that is on the flavor spectrum for sub ohm so that's our Ripper check out the full review on that one so moving into the sub ohms we really have two units that a lot of people often compare and contrast we have our our Cannabis Cup winning sub ohm original kit which a lot of people on the YouTube channel refer to as the OG cannabis cup kit really like that name possible name change there and our newest sub ohm Sport kit now both of them have very high capacity batteries both of them have really awesome tanks both of them are in terms of budget wise they're definitely on the higher end of the spectrum there there both under $200 the subohm sport is 169 and the sub-ohm original kit is right around that $200 mark so these aren't your regular budget kits these are your luxury kits but they definitely perform now in terms of availability of what you have available if you have 510 thread cartridges available you're not going to be will unscrew this tank and use a 5-10 thread cartridge on this battery without an ego adapter on our sub ohm og kit you do have an ego adapter that you unscrew right here you just flip this over put it back onto your battery and you're able to use 510 thread cartridges you can fill these with syringes or tinctures I would probably not consider these as stealthy as versatile and versatile even though they do fit into the pocket they are heavier I mean that's a good in terms of a quality standpoint but they do have a little bit of half so in terms of mobility and you know stealthiness you don't really get away with that the subohm sport is slightly stealthier than the OG kit because it has a window covering around the glass so you don't really see what's in there it also offers a little bit more protection now the battery life these things are both ultra high capacity they're way over the 1500 mAh as well so you get a lot of capacity of these you charge these things up a lot of people go days without getting a charge even without having to recharge it even our very heavy daily users both these units you can dial up the power big-time this one goes up to 36 watts which is more than what you will need this one actually goes all the way up to 60 watts which is definitely way more than you're ever really gonna need which which can just really you know melt the whole power spectrum in terms of hits now in terms of flavor they're going to be a little bit different you can use a blender option on here which uses a solid block ceramic heater and then this one uses a ceramic and Kanthal heater in here which has different bottom draw and orifice holes a lot of people say that this kid is really easy to get started with but basically you start off with this kit and then you graduate into kind of this tank with the the taste delivery and the power and how you're actually able to use as a blender and put solid concentrates into there so power these kits are both way up in the spectrum flavor I would say they're both up there and the very high rankings of flavor but once you you know really want to fine-tune your experience there's nothing really like the og cannabis cup kit that's what the judges and socal thought and really that's what a lot of our audience things but these kids are really closely matched now the only other thing that I can say to add to these two that's going to decrease your mobility but increase the power and flavor you're gonna be all have on tap is adding our bumblebee bubbler we did a full review and demo on this with honey girl or another one of our videos is you can pair it with our sub ohm devices and it can because you'll run it through water you can really crank up the power and really smooth out even more flavor to take your vaping experiences to all new levels however what's this gonna do to your oil pen definitely gonna increase you know it's gonna sorry decrease your mobility it's definitely gonna decrease any stealthiness that you had it's gonna increase the power I would say it will definitely increase the flavor notes as well it's gonna tack on another about 20 to 30 bucks to your budget cuz you're watching this video so you're gonna wait for the discount code at the end and it's also what's cool about those availability wise you can actually pair this thing with 510 thread cartridges to still put them on so this is still compatible with 510 thread cartridges so that's the bubbler lastly the only other way that you can improve your oil vaping experience is by having a battery like our speed barrier it has a lot of features but you have to be a really an expert vape level to really use this battery you can set the Watts in just fine but there's features and temperature controls and how you want your power to come on that you're not gonna get in standard batteries it really takes a step above even these two batteries and it has twice the capacity and power availability of both these batteries so you know you can also get one of these batteries to pair with your oil tanks however this battery is too powerful for a lot of little oil tanks so it's not gonna be fully compatible there alright so just to summarize guys thank you so much for tuning in I hope that walking through our old oil devices and showing you guys how we rank them in terms of what's available to you your budget your stealthiness your ease of use - battery life mobility power and flavor hopefully those features and us walking to our devices will help you with your buying

"sEu2r-qWzRo": "okay so we're going to change out well actually we're going to lubricate the washer in this tap I'll turn the water off but making that very grind you're pretty rough noise so let's see if we can't pull out and lubricate it now you do need quite a few tools for this job so I'll start you off you need something to pry this out the little temperature knob down here is how we're going to get the handle off and you can either use a little screwdriver actually have a little screwdriver and a fuel gauge which wants a feeler gauge is something actually an old thing use because four points capstan spark plug gaps but anyway I couldn't get it off without I had to just use the pointer knife and that got it off to get that out there before you not that little guy out it's important to put both your plugs in because you don't want that little guy to come scooting out and run down the drain otherwise you eat having yourself another job that you really wouldn't want to have to do so he's got in behind that and limit it out but it wasn't easy just personally with it and we'll have to get in underneath two hands put that there well that's dead you don't give anywhere if you sleep you're gonna cut yourself look for the biggest gap on it and then you do actually have to get in and underneath it as I said it was very difficult here we go under it now pop it out as I say put it somewhere safe it's only very little there it is has little spring form on the back to hold it in place and then in there is an allen key I'm using that and up with this an allen key in there so we're going to get in and undo there it is sits in place and undo a little tab that is here and then when you get it loose enough yep that will come straight off so now we've got the handle off and it has a little plastic insert there with a flat back and around in front which matches up here in the tap with a flat back and rounded front now this is the cartridge here this is the bit that brings in the hot and cold water and mixes it in its attempt so then this here needs to unwind that will come off that's just a little plastic lock nut try not to use tools on that get it off with your hand if you can because it will mark and then here we've got a knot now I could arrange your tools here all these will do the job is a decent sized pair of vise-grips slip-joint pliers will do this you can adjust it to the right thing but then the proper tool is actually a decent-sized shifter but you may not have that but those guys will suffice as well and as a matter of fact yeah my shift is out to the maximum all right normal anti-clockwise direction and yeah I haven't said it yet but obviously before you go pull on the tap apart any further than it is now you need to turn the water off now for me there's two knobs here and being a mix attack you need to turn them both off both the hot and the cold and turn them so they're across the pipe or maybe you've got to turn your water off outside just depending on your setup but you will need to turn the water off before you go any further otherwise you will have a fountain running in the middle of your sink so set this down again pull this apart here we go should come off the fingers down okay there's the lock ring and now that cartridge will come out for that so this cartridge here now I'm going to have to do what I can to clean out again keeping the track of how you pulled it out this one inside you can see there's a couple of pins and a couple of holes you can see how that lines up here the two pins go into these holes here and here which line up them with the three holes so it needs to go back in and sit into those two pinholes otherwise is looking to work properly so now when you can just take this now down to the hardware store and buy a new cartridge but if you want to try and live it up which is what I'm going to do here we're going to clip this apart right here and see if we can't see if we can get this apart and give it a loop if you're going to give it a loop is only one thing to lubricate it we don't lubricate it with vaseline vaseline will stretch your seals now you need a silicon-based lubricant and I've got just a little cloth of that here we'll go to lubricate that up with that red cap comes off again keep your drains closed so there's any little bits come out of here they're not going to flick down the sink okay that has come off we've got through to that part now I'm not going to pull this about anymore that I need to this little ball here is obviously moving this around so I'm looking for where was the grimy feeling where was it not happy not comfortable that I feel feel pretty good through there it's not grimy there that all feels really good and well lubricated so in all these bits yes you can pull it right to pieces but I don't intend to do that I'm going to pull it apart any more that I have to so that balls going to move that backwards and forwards and around and there's a good bit of Lube on there that's all feeling good so I'll pull that out [Music] there's your rubber o-rings down below that part doesn't move it stays sealed into the base the partha moves is that face there on there so what I'm going to do I'll get some paper towel and I'll wipe that clean and then reapply the silicon based lubricant onto that because if it gets a bit of grit in it or something like that just give all of that a wipe down remembering which face is which in what's going on and all of this so I'll get the silicon based lubricant and put a good amount of this on just goes on to that face but that's what's going to be moving around and it does move around a bit on that key as well so we'll put a bit in there so that goes back onto there as it was on that face then I'm also going to give that o-ring their grease you'll be checking all this out if there's pinches or brakes or whatever then you'll know you'll have a leak in your you'll need to address that but I don't making sure there's no little stones or dirt or anything in that track down there and then set that back into place there it clicks back into place this here we can put a little bit of lubricant onto that shove it down the sides there like that that's all good it was the up and down that was causing the rough feeling okay so we'll put this back on now now you're looking here or what we've got we've got a big hole of the front which lines up with this and the clips at the side and then a little thing at the back so it's pretty hard to get it on incorrectly or it won't go on incorrectly so you need to line up that little stainless steel ball with that select drops in here we go click it into place that's working you can see the works of it here how it was closed off or opened up and what it's doing that's feeling nice and smooth now so I've got a bit of grease on my finger what I'm going to do is just grease that o-ring down there look it's popped out so I'll pull it out and then what I'm going to do I'll just look at that silicon based lube on my hand give all that a grease we'll turn that over we'll sit it into place there so that seals up nicely trying not to stretch it here we go that's all good now remembering the two lugs here that I told you about and lining them up with the two holes down there so we plop that in and over and press that down and then we get this yes that's gone into place that's what we want okay so then the next step is to get this lock nut back in place screw that down now remember that you've got big tools here and probably you know something will you be working with good quality taps other will you'll be working in made in China not so good a quality so you want to tight hold them in position you want to try it but don't give it everything you've got you're not working on a car you working on a tap so just up nice and snug like that that's really good and then this little red lock nut goes back on that's not a lock nut so just holds the key in place that's feeling good it's not gritty anymore and then this guy goes on to clean that bit of chrome just there because really easy right now to give it a good polish and a clean but really hard so it's under the tap there we go and now the handle goes back on again looking for the flat part it's on here it goes on like that on an over beautiful that's repaired that's come up nicely so now what we need to do is there's a little allen key in here we need to tighten that through the hole get the allen key tighten that so it locks back into place and it will actually lock onto that little drilled hole in so we can have our one key into the hole it will be standing out a bit so a little bit harder to get it in the right spot it's not yeah so get down and level and look at it get a torch if you need to there it is I took it out with this allen key so I know it's the right size there we go that's what we want no here we go it was very tight to come out and it's going to be tight in as well so you can get a pair of pliers onto your allen key again being careful with this sort of thing you don't go breaking things it's tightening up there and again not not doing that so tight that you snap things or crack things if this comes loose you've got to loose tap on the tops popping off then that's what you do you pop off the cover and do that that is looking magnificent okay now we'll put a little pin back on and it does matter the hot and the cold that's Happy's hot in that direction so put that on like that there we go okay turn the water on [Music] let's see you see the water coming through but listen here the noise that was there that's now beautiful it smooth no noise or was correctly getting really tight you can you go go to maintenance for the lubrication when it's rough and jumping like that of course it's wearing all those plastic components that eventually it will then start to leak and you will have to replace the cartridge but if you get on to it at this stage you can simply lubricate the cartridge and that taps now working perfectly and all this so give it a bit of a run because there will be a little firm silicone lubricant might come through initially so give it a bit of a run on top turn it round to coal hot you think about all those heating sources any excess Lube that can just come through back around the cold done excellent great repair", "IrpQAUKvX7s": "your video showing you how to change the tack cartridge on a friend he is going to tap first of all you need to isolate the water this is easily done by all things valve or the main stock then we will need to take the handle off there was a small grub screw underneath the handle and it's a 2 mil allen key and undo that anti-clockwise until the handle is loose and then if you then you can actually see the tack cartridge itself this one by Frankie hasn't got a traditional hex head on it it's got two rounded edges which means it can be quite tricky one to get a spanner in there and two it will not allow you to get a socket in in the body to take the veil veil an easy work getting these out is by using a standard adjustable spanner get it in onto the flats of the cartridge and what we're gonna do is use a pair of grips onto the spanner to undo the valve you could use another spanner to try and dirt I will use a pair of grips and then pull towards you so that the tail is turning anti-clockwise that will release the valve continue unspinning have a bit water here we have got the valve removed we will fit the new one bite at magician as you can see the new valve has a hex head on it so for future on removal will be a lot easier you need to make sure that you've got the right one the red for the hot and the cold for the cold on this side with their the cold so we will insert the cold and we repeat the process screwing that now clockwise and we can tighten it the same with a spanner or now we've got the hex head you can use the socket do that I'm quite firmly and now as you see the socket will actually fit on there so if that was to become hard to get out I can now get my socket set in there another thing to remember is to take this screw up because this screw will actually fail on the handle and it does it can stay on the hook for that stop here fix the handle using the allen key again clockwise and that should be in the job done apart from what got the handle in the wrong place love things to check so that's the right position now I'm gonna turn the water back on and that Isabel successfully

Hello and welcome to Videojug. The following steps will explain how to inspect,\nclean, and replace the cartridge which controls the flow of water in a ceramic disk tap. Step one. You will need, a settable sized or adjustable\nspanner. A crosshead screwdriver. A wrench. You may also need a wire brush, a soft towel,\nand a knife with a thin blade. Step two, turn off the water supply. Before you begin make sure you turn off the\nwater supply for the tap you are working on. This may mean turning off the water at the\nmain tap for your house. This is usually located under or near your\nkitchen sink. If working on a hot tap, you may need to locate\nthe hot water tank and turn off the supply from there. Now check that the water is off by turning\non your tap. Very little water should come out. When you're sure that the mains are off, turn\nthe tap fully on to drain it of any excess water. Handy Hint. Put in the plug. This will stop you loosing anything down the\nplug hole whilst you dismantling the tap. Step three, remove the cap. Using a knife with a thin blade, gently pry\noff the cap. The screws should be easily visible. Step four. Remove the headgear. Place the knife and cap to one side. Pick up your cross head screwdriver and start\nunscrewing the headgear off the cartridge. Once unscrewed, pry the headgear off with\nyour fingers and place to one side. Step five, inspect the rubber seal. You will need to inspect the rubber seal on\nthe bottom of the cartridge to check for any damage or wear. If it seems worn or damaged you should replace\nit as it could be causing the drip. Step six, remove and inspect the cartridge. Use a wrench or a suitably sized spanner to\nremove the cartridge by turning it anticlockwise. Now inspect it for any wear and tear or obvious\ndamage. If the cartridge is dirty, clean off any debris\nas this alone could be the cause of the problem. Step seven, choose the correct cartridge. If the disk is obviously cracked then you\nwill need to replace it with a new cartridge. Make sure that the new cartridge is the same\ntype as the old one. Step eight, reassemble. Once you have determined and corrected the\nproblem, simply go back over yourself step by step to reassemble your ceramic disk tap\nand enjoy your new drip free life. Done.

uncovered information about some recent cases here in Tucson news 4 - sauce Lupita Mario shows us how bad the problem has become this is a vaping cart it contains THC found in marijuana it's also sold at dispensaries and sold on the black market for half the price that's where the trouble begins in January three masked individuals went to a Tucson home where fake carts were being manufactured counter-narcotics Alliance officers say the suspects beat and robbed the homeowner of cash marijuana and the illegal carts he was manufacturing we've been to several home invasions this year where individuals have been shot because of cartridges sergeant Alfredo Meza is with the Tucson Police Department assigned to CNA his unit investigates violent crimes associated with narcotics a lot of the time dealers are dealing in fake vape cartridges a lot of times they're putting in unknown substances to cut it and to make a bigger volume and to make their their money stretch so we don't know what's getting put in those vials vial such as these all of them fake sergeant Meza told the digging deeper team these were seized during a home invasion the homeowner was shot and a CNA officer found evidence he was making the THC vape cartridges inside his apartment there's not a lot of consistency in the manufacturer of this stuff anywhere there's no FDA regulation that goes through to make sure that they're not putting in cases in California they found cyanide in vape cartridges Captain John Leavitt is also with the Tucson Police Department and heads CNA and it's extremely dangerous it's toxic to your system and it can not only make people sick but it kills people according to the latest numbers from the CDC 2290 cases were reported from 49 states 47 deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia the median age of the people dying is 53 it's an extreme health hazard and if you look at the guidance from the CDC they they vary circumspectly suggest that you don't vape most of the carts come from the black market these are pictures of the fake ones authorities say the active ingredient in the carts is THC that gives the people the high but people are now adding other ingredients to the carts such as mineral oil and vitamin E a toxic combination the CDC has discovered that is causing nearly 3000 people across the United States to have lung issues all we know so far is that in its infancy it's caused the terrible problems for a lot of people in his destined to do even worse investigators say that the raw THC oil is brought in from California because it's legal there and then smuggled into Arizona to manufacture the fake carts police say just days ago a 17 year old was shot in Tucson and is in critical condition at a local hospital they say he was buying carts and when he realized they were fake there was a dispute and shots were fired digging deeper Lupita more real news for Tucson", "4BdcP-muFOM": "this video will show you how to take your Kohler kitchen faucets water pressure from this to this this is my Kohler faucet in the kitchen and this is the type of water pressure I have just rolled all the way very little okay I got the faucet removed out of the sink and now I'll try to clear out the lines okay so I'm out here in the garage now and I'm going to try to blow out whatever's inside of the lines out with my compressor I'm going to use about 80 psi I got these plastic screens out of from each other hot and cold water lines this more orange ones from the hot side it's pretty clear I'm just cold one there are some blockages so I'll be taking those out with a needle here we go that looks much better okay so I got the sink reinstalled and it did not work out so as you can see if anything the pressure that worse so what I did was I went out and got a genuine Kohler replacement part for the spray wand because I know I'm getting full pressure from the water supply so coming up from the water supply down below the sink up through the faucet it's full pressure but somewhere around here we're losing power so I'm thinking that this might be the culprit so to take this out you just unscrew this and if you look in here it's pretty clean if you actually take this white part out you're going to reuse it so the mesh is pretty clean so this is the old one this is the new one okay so to install this all you do is take this white part stick it back on here make sure this wash oh ring is in good shape and on the other side you got the old wing oh ring and the ceramic disc on there as well okay you just put squeeze this back in the spray wand okay and then you screw this in you don't need to do it super tight turn it's just hand tight barely hand tight okay so now that's on let's give it a try okay that's much better yeah that's a lot more pressure than before when the stop feature actually stops it actually works before with that older tower wand even if I press down on this I would get drift so I think that was the problem okay thanks for watching if you want to buy the one the spray wand I'm providing a link below where you can buy it from that was on thanks for watching", "3f38yfY3OO8": "right that's awesome when you say freaking a whole little place [Music] so we can do with that it might be easy Delta kit here little tool that comes with take the hand loss hopefully the handle will come off sometimes these faucets get corroded can't get apply can't get the handle off yeah isn't a cannot run without the animals you can see that we'll try to tighten in the first see if that works [Music] let's write tightening it and see if that works that might just take you I got a rebuild kit fortified after we build it [Music] brought oppression right down here in a wall because I'll take care of so leaking outgoing it was really leaking off the top there as well as we can now see it coming right there there's always in here that needs to be fixed so let's see if we can pick it apart we shut the water off when I get the water off right so it's off we'll see if we can detonate off of that [Music] so now we can turn this back turn this back and then once we tighten it will tighten it again there's ol Wings in here these o-rings here you go to check this sometimes I'll take sandpaper and sand if this gets rough in here it won't seal some key grease in there take my sandpaper and I'll run it on the inside sometimes it gets pitted I'm going to get pitted will stop it from getting a smooth smooth transition mama seeing it spit it see how it's pitted it's a normal faucet do what you can for and then and if it can't be fixed we'll replace it you can see how it gets all see what it's all corroded in there that's probably what it is no matter what you do with your still them unless you get it smooth we'll put the wings on it and we'll try it give this a sand drop and we'll put new o-rings on it some key grease some promise peace [Music] in a couple with a couple of new ones here [Music] no qualms grease plumbers grease Keighley same thing you put a little bit a little on them I'm gonna put a little Lube [Music] also put some inside here with this the best I can do with it put it on there and spin it as you go there you go put the cap back on [Music] that's what they call a strap wrench this way it won't go in a chrome okay [Music] plan this back up again and give it a try we'll give it another try all y'all yeah all all the time just tightening this packing nut up will do the job but obviously there was multiple issues going on here with this old baby nick little month Nicollet she is nick level y'all alright we'll try it out turn the water on and we'll give it up give it the old gun down and see what happens we'll give the old bunny mama turn water back [Music] [Music] a lot of pressure he has the problems I don't think this part is that old be honest with it the best I'm going to do with it put it back together we'll run it a little bit to see what happens I'm thinking it's going to be fine going to be fine you're going to be fine almost put the per little a little pea grease on the shaft there it's some get some Lube in there because if you ever going to get the handle off again lenses today corrode it on there it rusted and you know you can't use wd-40 on water it's going to be some kind of plumbers grease that's compatible with water [Music] it's all clean [Music] it's got a lot of pressure going on here in this house so we've down here on the right down here on the ocean a lot of times it's a putting a lot of water pressure to the faucet you know what tend to want to spit let me put another one on there I don't want your way up this these are the ones are like spring flow they're really good that's what's there but it's missing it's missing some parts [Music] [Music] that's better [Music] all right that's good we were the old parts right there so she knows what I changed breakdown there in the ocean I set up", "jZMZxVFzMqY": "so here's the problem this is a an American standard kitchen faucet called the Lillian 41444 SSF something like that sold exclusively through Home Depot and it's supposed to have a lifetime drip free valve in the faucet so so you can see after only a couple of years it's dripping so we're gonna have to see what the problem is is it the cartridge or is something else so if you stick around let's take a look and see what we can find [Music] okay I've secured the water the supply valves that are underneath the sink and I've taken an Allen wrench and I have loosened up the the set screw that holds the handle on so that now the handle comes straight off there's a little bit of a decorative ring that keeps you from taking the valve out they kept cartridge and that just unscrews and it comes up very easily now there are apparently there are three screws in the cartridge holding the cartridge in I'm going to have to loosen those take them out and we'll see if I can get the cartridge out easily I've loosened the three screws and they weren't in very tight one with little bits like the others were very loose and now and I made sure I put a stopper in the drain in case any screws came out I don't want to lose them and I still have a screw holding on yep and the cartridge just comes right out no problem and that's what it looks like apparently this is a an American standard feature they say that this contains ceramic discs which allow the drip-free feature but I know I want to look in here and see what I can see see if there's anything else that shows itself it seems to be a little bit of a seal and possibly and there are more more screws and I'm going to check those and there's slug those are tight just two screws well I'm gonna do here and this also has locating pins so that you line it up properly what I'll do is I'll put this back in tighten it up and let's see if that helps I have it all back together where that cartridge is just plastic I didn't want to tighten it down too hard but I gave a little bit of a snug and it's in there tighter than it was when I first found it and as you can see it's not leaking I turn the water on when I shut it off you get like maybe one drop after I shut it off and then that's it it's not leaking so I think that was the problem we just had the cartridge the screws had loosened up a little bit after a couple of years working this back and forth all the time I could see how it could happen because you really can't muscle down on these screws they can't be too tight it has like a little nylon seal between the cartridge and the body of the of the faucet but that's all it took to repair it if I did have to replace that cartridge American Standard their website says it goes for a little over eight dollars eight dollars and change so that's not too bad and I believe that Home Depot also has some replacement cartridges in stock so that's all there was to that problem solved [Music]", "56-f9UI1Zsw": "Hi! This John on behalf of Expert Village.\nIn this video clip I will show you how to tighten a sink handle. I'm going to show you\nthe inside of the faucet first. You will see that there is a set screw here which tightens\nthe faucet handle to the inside. There is a hole on the outside, where your Allen wrench\nwill go and fit in the set screw that you are going to tighten down. So this is what\nit is going to look like when we are doing this on the faucet. So looking at our faucet,\nwe have this hole that we are going to put our Allen wrench into, and there is a set\nscrew inside of it. So we are going to go ahead and tighten up that Allen screw, and\nit looks like our faucet is pretty good. For this I turn the water off, but for most cases\nit is not necessary.", "y3Bjg6nlYyY": "what's up everyone john here from respect my region and today we have another west coast wii tour review and we are going to be doing a vape review we have a tomahawk 510 cartridge from napalm it's a live resin diamonds they're one gram cartridge so let's read a little bit about we'll see what they got on the back here it says tomahawk live resin diamonds vape cartridge 69.01 percent thc 0.78 cbd and one point seven two percent total thc um weight one grant net weight and then just tells you the total weight with the cart um twist the cartridge onto the compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved so um pretty vague on the information on the box but the box itself looks [ __ ] stunning i mean look at this napalm it has nice raised edges you just like grab this and this really does feel like a luxury cannabis experience you know you buy this and you feel like you spent your money well i guess is the the best way to put this so napalm is partners um with exhibit exhibit is behind napalm cannabis and he fancies himself a firearm if you've ever watched excuse me if you ever watch exhibit on his instagram he's always shooting all kinds of guns and so the brandy napalm cannabis the grenade pre-roll it all kind of makes sense you know all kind of based off like military hardware um so i'm gonna go ahead and slide this open and a nice slide box boom and right there we got a nice nice the cartridge is beautiful with the green um some of these are orange too so it just kind of matches with what the strain is you've got the green branded flame look we can really see the color of the oil this is a gram cartridge i have smoke been smoking on this i was on vacation in wenatchee so um yeah but you can as you can see the color of the oil is really translucent really good definitely looks like live resin let's see if we can see it move that's the other key with live resin is you want to be able to see it move like with your eyes and yep it's definitely um moving in there you can see the the liquid is starting to go to the top of the cartridge so i'm going to go ahead and pull off these little rubber stoppers scroll this onto my battery you never want to over twist so once it's on it's just boop stop most vape pens click five times and it's on let's see what's up super turpy terps hit your back your throat you definitely i have no idea um what the tomahawk is what if that's like a into mix meaning they just took two different types of starting material and blended it during the extraction process i'm not sure if tomahawk is is a strain of theirs one of their uh you know flagship strains but i definitely get like a really florally earthy taste it's nothing spectacular but it's really smooth and yeah let's go down this uh the rating score 10 point that's a 10 categories 100 point rating system let's see what's going down presentation presentation i got to go with 10 it looks wonderful from the sliding it out with just the the little raised edges of the flames and the whole the gold trim it looks different it stands out and that's and uh you know napalm cannabis it's easy to remember it sticks in your head so yeah i'll give the presentation a ten product appeal nine um i i think it would get a little bit higher if there was a little bit more information about the oil in it about the the strain that went into the oil it says live resin diamonds but uh you know a lot of people don't even know what live resin diamonds are honestly so i would like to know a little bit more about the strain and stuff to to maybe get that perfect that perfect product appeal score color yeah you know you go with a nine it looks really really good the oil is just uh fantastic it looks really good nine color i did color smell um you can't really smell you know i don't really get like a turpy smell through the car or anything like that but when you rip it you just get like a basic vape oil smell it doesn't smell crazy terpe so i go five taste seven i said didn't blow me away by any means the taste uh i didn't really get like a potent terpy taste potency uh i would give this this is gonna get a good potency for i'd give it a nine um i started smoking this last week i ran out of dabs and i switched to my pen and this more than got me where i needed to go um when i wasn't smoking on dabs you know five or six rips of that and i was blazed for sure so high potency score experience um i'm gonna give the experience a seven i definitely didn't hate it but i definitely didn't love it you know i wish i just got more flavor when i think right live resin i just think of crazy terpy flavors and i just kind of got like a basic vape distillate taste you know didn't really give me the live resin experience more information they definitely give me all the basics about you know manufacturing packaging things like that i wish i got a strain lineage more information maybe about what live resident diamonds are somewhere on the packaging you know they have two boxes you could put some stuff right here just because uh you know then the knowledge around extracts is still very um niche in a lot of ways and so i would like brands to take that step up to educate the consumers more on their packaging would you recommend i actually would recommend this though i would give this you know not a strong mega recommendation but i definitely you know my friend hit me up was like yo what do you think about napalm cannabis i'm like bro you should probably get one of those you know live resin diamonds cards because they are nice they look cool the the cartridge itself is is awesome like the design behind this is very cool it looks cool so yeah definitely a seven on the recommendation and overall yeah stick with the seven as well like i said the flavors didn't blow me away but the quality is obviously present so i think napalm cannabis is definitely on the right track to um you know just absolutely crushing the game and that's all i have for you today make sure to like the video subscribe to the channel uh check out respectmyregion.com on youtube because we have a bunch of content coming soon video content and make sure everyone has a good day and i'll see y'all later", "OBsUys_38gE": "hey guys so today we're going to fix a Moen faucet one of these kind right here they take a 12:55 cartridge so my other video that I did on the other sink very similar to this one remember was not in HD well we're going to get an HD version to be able to update my videos so a mon 1225 or 12:55 rather has something like this so this is a 12:55 cartridge and that piece has to be replaced the internal parts on the inside have to be they wear out from time to time and they just get replaced it comes with this piece here which is just a nut and then of course you've got a replacement retainer screw that holds on the handle and you get the allen key so let's take it apart that's right that's right not even six months ago so in this case because you guys recognize the kitchen I built this kitchen and now we have a mold problem so this drip this is dripping so step one is to change the cartridge I've taken this off there's a little screw on the back and there's a little screw right there and you have to take out the screw and then there's this up here so this is just a piece of plastic and now we have to be able to pry this off and it just comes off no screw no unscrew nothing just simply comes off and then we have this I pre loosen this so now we have to simply just remove this thing and be open this guy up and the 12:55 are pretty simple so I'm just lined everything I've noticed the paper towel everything is then lined up so again all the different pieces that I'm going to be able to take off so technically I don't lose anything if I put it all in one bowl well I'm going to lose things and I don't know which way they go but the Mon is pretty simple this is a keyed thing you can see this piece only goes in one way it's small little bumps on the side and they can only go in one way so that's the old one and you can see on the inside where the water is able to pass from one port to the Elbe to the others and now we simply put in the new one so of course we line up the bumps on the backside and it simply slides right in place and then we have the retainer nut and that just simply goes right in place and line that up and we tighten this down and we get that nice and tight we're going to have to tighten this up with a wrench and eventually the same sort of thing we're simply just going to replace the plastic that piece goes in place and we're going to tighten up this screw with the allen key provided that's it basically guys real simple stuff so a Moen faucet with a 12:55 is a pretty simple one so anyways guys sa m3 79 out", "dMgb3UnMx5I": "yo so this is Chris with G farmer TV and today I'm going to go ahead and break down different uses on liquid gold seal to syringes so the first you want to go ahead and do is take off your actual seal on the syringe remove that and I wouldn't want to go ahead and use this right away until I have my plastic needle point only because it actually helps manage the portion of your dab actually helps manage the portion of whatever cartridge you're actually using to refill and it helps you from preventing them making a mess because the last thing you want to do is spill your liquid gold all over the floor or all over your hand one messy situation so not only can you refill just the liquid gold cartridges just by putting the plastic insert along the sides I want to go ahead and recommend to let the wick soak I mean that's pretty much the component that actually keeps igniting so the more drenched your wicks are better taste you will actually consistently have on every plus that tends to be the number one part that drives up I didn't use my whole half randomized liquid ghost range so what I would do is pull back we tracked my oil back into the syringe take off my plastic needle point and put back my actual seal this is the number one part you do not want to throw this away you plan to reseal your liquid goats are in good to go how could you tell if you have a good quality co2 syringe well the lighter and the thicker the better more water down your oil is the more there is a possible chance that it's cut with poly glycol any vegetable glycerin and the artificial terpene that are turns your oil from quality to quantity now when it comes to strain-specific syringes or strain-specific concentrates it's kind of tricky to go ahead and commercialize those actual strains because you do need a lot of plant material to actually run on a consistent basis so if you have a major farm with that one string to go ahead and commercialize our power to you until then I'm yet to see that let me just go ahead and show you that not only can you refill most co2 510 cartridges with liquid gold vapor oil but you could definitely go ahead and use it on different things such as put it on your flower taking a dive out of it different alternatives that you actually medicate with and you just want to go ahead and intensify or increase the actual THC no matter what way helps you out to go ahead and medicate with liquid gold vape boy there's different alternatives I like to go ahead and choose a safe discreet way when I'm on the go so I keep my pen in

fired I have really big dread medicated the Abbas's uriga high potency this thing is really hitting me right now and it's it's more of like um it's like it's like when you're smoking your Jordan or

this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that rhymed lit let me unpack these and give them a try

"MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "NyP7r-0VY4U": "hell trevor here with write a leaf and today we're going to be tapping into a 510 cartridge for this review we've got phyto extracts fire stick 2.0 it's their pink kush dislip pen i'm really excited to try this out and see how it does y'all let's get into it we'll see on the other side when we're tapping off the little bit of info that's on here before we get into the full on urban scale see on the other side cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we are tapping into fido extracts pink kush 510 cartridge so this sucker came in with a thc total of 79.1 percent it's got zero cbd in it and it was packaged on the 15th of may 2020 i'm just gonna start pulling it apart while we're chatting through the information so we've got the lift and co website pulled up with this information you guys so we'll uh run all that off before we tap into this beautiful looking car so we've got pink kush 510 cartridge pink kush is an indica dominant hybrid that much like it's close relative og kush delivers a sweet aroma accompanied by a distinct herbal taste these point five gram distillate cartridges are made from food grade all natural terpenes with zero fillers and additives it contains 75 to 85 thc and no cbd we use top of the line c cell cartridges that features a ceramic heating element when filled this heating element absorbs up to 0.15 milliliter of the 0.5 mil of oil contained in the cartridge this can lead to the appearance of a head space at the top of the cartridge each of our cartridges are auto filled by weight to ensure that you receive exactly 0.5 of oil with 100 accuracy we need to get that thc sticker off there so we'll throw that on the torch while we uh rattle off the oh they don't have any more information you guys so uh i'm going to stick this on the torch while we uh do the urban scale intro and then we'll tap into this cartridge y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of this intro [Music] welcome back you guys so we've got the pink kush cartridge right here we're gonna get rid of all those silicone dude ads screw this into the fireside battery and start a rocking with this sucker we're going to start out on the lowest temp come on there we go white light starting on the lowest temp we're going to take a rip through there we're going to go up to the medium and then the high try it all the way through there i'll give you a little bit of my thoughts and opinions on it after that and then we will go on into the g pen battery before we put our adapter on here and we start ripping it through a couple of glass pieces that we have here as well you guys i'm really looking forward to seeing how this pink kush hits taste i'm just excited to see how fido did their transition from the dark black gray market into this legal market so uh only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping in and finding out so uh let's do that cheers i like the elongated tip on this they're similar to what trailblazer had but it's a longer glass tip and i like that okay so it is kind of a sweet herbal flavor nothing overwhelming nothing really that screams excitement for me but it's definitely one of the better tasting pink kush products i've tried so now we're on that medium temp let's uh take a haul at this level and see what it tastes like here you guys cheers okay guys so got a good herbal push on that one got a little bit of a pepper flavor as well which wasn't disappointing it just wasn't expected i'm i'm liking it now it balances out with that kind of sweet herbal it's but it's not a really overpowering flavor it's strong when you have it in your mouth and when you exhale but it really dissipates quickly after that which is a little bit disappointing for me but still not bad so uh we've got it on the highest temp guys let's take a rip through here see how it does uh before we switch it on over to the g pen cheese yes we moved over to the g pen from that fireside battery i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10. it had a nice flavor to it but it didn't hit hard enough to hold the flavor and it didn't have a really enjoyable enough flavor to make me want to just keep hauling on it so i have it in my mouth it's it's that good for one hit kind of a high and flavor not necessarily high but it's good for like a one hit it's not really that sugary treat that i'm finding my vape cartridges are really more what that's for they're kind of for that dessert of smoking right i'm i'm done having this harder [ __ ] i'm done smoking that i'm like bong rips and dabs and stuff like this i just want something light to sip on with a really sweet flavor and that's definitely where these come in handy but uh seven out of ten is the best i'm gonna give it for the fire side moving on into the g pen we've got it set on the lowest temperature let's see how it does and taste through here you guys before we move on and rock it through the glass i'm expecting a pretty good outcome from this let's see cheers okay guys we're on that medium level let's see how it does i got almost more of a sour cush kind of push with this it was nice it was really unique for uh the changes from that fireside battery and it's one of the biggest reasons why i like using different batteries you guys because you do get a totally different experience with these and i'm really really enjoying this pink kush so far but got on the medium temp let's tap in and try it out cheers so we've got it on the highest temp you guys okay let's get into this i am feeling this pink kush already which is not something i am used to i haven't had a pink cush strain hit hard and have a really good high for me like ever the flower just it's a strain that doesn't really do much so this this this pens got me excited you guys so we've got on the highest temp let's see how it does through here before we uh move on and give it a score on that medium level i still got that kind of sour kush taste which i enjoyed i'm i'm not upset with that kind of sour dank cushy flavor but uh let's see if the high temp does the same thing you guys cheers okay guys so i'm gonna give the g pen made out of a tent it had just a little bit more of that kind of sour cushy flavor that i do really enjoy and definitely look forward to when i'm smoking these kind of these kind of carts this pink kush is definitely uh something that's caught me off guard you guys and i'm really looking forward to seeing how it's gonna taste to the glass but uh we've got we are a mad bell here a little mad hatter bell we've got the fireside battery ready to go we are starting out at the lowest temp again working our way up to the high we do preheat on our high temp only because why not so uh yeah i think that's all the info we need y'all let's start doing this i'll see on the other side of these uh these three rips cheers last two let's preheat it y'all [Music] okay guys we're back on the g pen we've got a 420 rig we're gonna tap into this and uh see how this pen does you guys i'm uh definitely looking forward to um seeing the flavor on it but uh the only way we can find out how it does is by finding out how it is low tam first medium then we preheat on the high just like that last bit get to y'all cheers [Music] last rip y'all cheers preheat it sink okay guys so i'm gonna give it an eight out of a ten from the glass had definitely that sweeter flavor that i was looking for um it did end up being a little bit harsher than i was expecting through the rig so that's why it's not quite the nine like it had the potential for the nine for the intensity of the flavor that was there but there was a harshness to it that just i didn't quite enjoy um and i bumped it down the point for that but all in all very well put together card for the flavor on the glass through the just sucking it straight through the vape it was really really nice and i i'm quite impressed honestly overall with this pig kush because i've been nothing but disappointed by it now moving into the high i'm going to give it a 9 out of a 10. the reason the point is docked is easier to explain it doesn't have any body effects it is strictly mental which is what i'm finding the majority of these cards to be is a head high and that's a little bit disappointing for me just because i've heard some really nice and enjoyable body effects that go with this pink kush but i'm just not finding it right now you guys just doesn't quite have it and that's it's a bit of a disappointment for me but there's there's nothing much i can do about it i'm gonna enjoy what i do get out of it which is that really nice heavy head high and overall i i think they did a pretty good job for the high and the flavor you guys moving to the overall with a 32 out of 40 i think it did overall very well um very sweet flavor definitely strong on that side um especially when we got into the glass or through the g pen but that little bit of a peppery harshness to the end when you bump that the temperature up to the highest levels is a touch of a turn off for me and a big reason why it lost at least one point in most of the taste scales and then just the lack of the sweet to comprom to uh to balance it out is typically the other reason why i would uh dock some points but overall you guys this this this cartridge did pretty well and i uh i'm quite impressed uh if you guys have tried it let me know down below what you think if you've tried any of uh phyto extracts cartridges let me know what you think we've had the super lemon hazel one in stock too and i was intrigued to try that one but uh the pink kush was definitely the one i think i needed to try first just to get a basis of where fido wanted to run with it and they they took a hell of a good run in my opinion you guys but uh let's drop this sucker up when the end card slides in you guys are gonna hover over the logo in the corner click

worry unclogging it is easy aerators are simple inserts that fit inside the faucets little chrome cap tiny holes in the aerator create a soft flow and minimize splashing but small particles in the water eventually blocked the miniscule holes in the aerator and it's screen and then you have a clog to unclog the aerator first place a towel or rag over the faucet cap or cover it with a little masking tape this keeps the surface from being marred when you strong-arm the cap off second use a wrench or pliers and turn the cap counterclockwise until it separates from the faucet third take the cap off you'll want to pay attention to the way the inserts are arranged because you have to replace these parts in the same sequence and position now that you've noted that remove the aerator screen and restrictor the fourth step is to clean the screens and water restrictor by flushing them with water you may need to use a brush or push through the tiny holes with a needle or pin to unclog them even if a coupler clogged your water flow is reduced the final step is to reassemble the aerator in the reverse order turn on the water and you should see a marked improvement in your water flow", "kX_Q94myqoQ": "what is up YouTube fabric boy baskets you're gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys and then a Saturday morning today it's time to wake and bake so I really hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along

fixed, keep watching. Follow along with me and learn how to fix your own in just\na few minutes. This repair is for faucets with only one handle and it's really very\neasy to do! The tools needed are Allen wrenches, large\nadjustable wrench and some needle nose pliers. First I'm going to remove the set screw found\njust under the handle. You may need to pop off a rubber cap that covers this screw. Mine\nwas missing. Before we start, turn off both water valves under the sink and cover up the\nsink to prevent small parts from accidently dropping into the drain. Just undo this Allen\nscrew and set it aside.  Now the handle should just slide off. On my\nfaucet, I need to unscrew this plastic ring. Yours may or may not have this. \nNow we need the adjustable wrench to loosen the metal collar. There are usually small\ngrooves where the wrench can grip onto.  Now I'll pop off another plastic ring. This\nball valve lifts straight out. Now I can see the rubber seals that need to be replaced.\nHere you can see that I've laid everything out in order of how I removed them. Now take\nyour needle nose pliers and gently grab the rubber seals and springs. I didn't know what\nbrand of faucet I had so I put some of the parts into a Ziplock bag and compared them\nwith what was available at the store. Mine turned out to be Delta. So now I'm going to\ntake the new parts and put them back into the faucet. This kit came with extra springs\nbut I used the ones that matched my old ones. So now everything goes back in reverse order.\nBe careful not to squeeze the rubber seals too hard with your pliers. \nBecause I laid everything out on the table, it was easy for me to put all the parts back\ntogether. Once the faucet has been reassembled, turn on the water valves underneath the sink.\nCheck to see that the faucet is running correctly. There may be some sputtering from the faucet\nafter you start the water.  Now when I turn off the faucet, the drip is\ngone!

video for today i'm going to show you how to empty out your vape carts in case that it's clogged or you just want to empty it out for dabs or whatever reason you might be doing so first you're going to want to use something to hold your vape cart here i just have a ring stand and laboratory clamp which i'm using to hold it next just use a lighter or a heat gun to heat up your cart until it starts to drip out into a container and that's pretty much it you do this with your single cart or you can even try it with multiple cards at the same time if you're looking to empty your cards this is pretty much the best way to do it you can leave it for a longer period of time and eventually most of it will drip out completely if you want to get every last bit you can go ahead and just put the solution in your oven for about 170 degrees fahrenheit or as low as your oven will go and it'll drip all the way out if you're looking to buy some high quality vape carts you can find these exact ones i'm using here at cartonpod.com [Music] you", "4BKYZt6DQX4": "my name is Dan Giles without the surf departments Myrtle Beach in South Carolina today's project is rebuilding a kitchen faucet I'll show you what tools were going to use how to take it apart I will replace all the pieces and also reassembly so let's get started okay the tools we're going to use today small allen wrench said channel locks crescent wrench plumbers briefs and of course we have our new o-rings and our new cartridge and as always we need to have a rag on hand to clean up any mess that we create so let's start tearing this thing you water going everywhere you take this faucet apart the reason we're changing the o-ring set out is because this faucet along with the spouse has gotten really hard to turn it's Russ death so we're gonna put you over first thing we're gonna do take a little indicator off matchup which oring which sets free wood you okay now we're gonna pull the spout off I usually like to do is take my rag put it behind here so that's Benny water that's inside of this faucet when you pull this spout off that water is going to come out you want this rag here to catch any excess water to keep it from going underneath that sink you okay all our pieces are clean we're ready to put over rings on okay now let's go ahead and put all our pieces back in all the new items first thing we want to do is put the new bearing in this is going to seat all the way to the bottom of the faucet this is what your spout is going to ride on we're going to take new o-rings it's a plumber grease and cook these o-rings with some grease they'll need to have a whole lot on there make sure it seats into the holes upper oring coat the whole thing with plumbers grease you don't really need to have a whole big glob of it on there just enough to cover put it in place okay you don't have to grease the inside of your spout the o-ring has got enough for for any kind of lubricant that it's going to need and we're going to put the top back on see that's turning really nice put our nut back in place this nut doesn't have to be too tight snug it up check your faucet you spell you've got good mobility good turning easy you're good to go here's a good example of watching what you do when you take parts off make sure you put the same amount of parts back on I put that nut on here and I fail to put in my upper bearing so I'm taking the nut off here's my upper bearing I'll go ahead see that in place now I can finish this installation without that upper bearing you're going to have a leak snug this up in tight over tighten now we can go ahead and put in the cart again it's not necessary to grease this o-ring and the seal it doesn't move but what you do want to look at is on some faucet to these little knobs or notches right here coincide with two little holes inside of the faucet those are going to seat if you don't get them in there this cartridge is going to sit too high and it's not going to work want to snap down in place so now that's in place where they put the nut cutting on that holds the cartridge crescent wrench Snug this up you don't have to overtype this just enough so it's not going to come out on its own all right we're almost there guys hang in there we'll flip them remainder the parts on and we'll give it a desk all right now we can put the handle back on it's just like it was when we took it off this one's being a little bit difficult make sure your set screws turned all the way out the new cartridges is not Gandhi indentations or dimples in it from being used that works perfect right there we want to tighten that set screw up there again we don't have to over tighten it just make it snug Oh put a little indicator back on we're good as faucets turning beautiful now a lot easier than it did when we started now I'm going to go ahead clean up any mess that I've made with my rag and we'll turn the water back on alright let's turn this on we're gonna check for leaks but you want to look for is any water coming around the base of the spout or up through the neck of the stop go ahead to turn it move it around check the leaks the common drive me I think we've got success and I hope that helps I know that it sometimes could be a little bit of a challenge to figure out how to do these things if you don't have help so today's reason for changing the o-rings was definitely evident the spout was really hard to turn so there's o-rings needed to come out and be replaced another reason to replace those overhangs that I didn't touch on was that if you're getting water on how suck that spout from either the bottom of the neck or the top of the neck just below the handle the o-rings are going to be letting water seep through and that water's going to find its way down into the cabinet under the sink and then you'll start getting some wood rot so you definitely want to take care of that pretty quickly anyway thanks again for watching I hope this has been helpful I'm Dan Giles with all the serf apartments Myrtle Beach South Carolina you", "qnJnuDTWlms": "hello everybody my name is J and I am coming to you with some problems with these vape pen cartridges so specifically these are the world's most awarded brand which is King pen and I've got multiple cartridges here that were given to me or lent to me with the purpose of figuring out why they won't work for whatever reason so I've identified after taking them apart and unscrewing them and messing with them and trying different ones and different contact points and cleaning and watching all the tutorials on youtube I have come up with the most comprehensive video in my opinion not how to fix these so there are three points here one is the air flow disrupted you could pause the video now and figure out so maybe as your air flow disrupted but I would suggest to wait until I start explaining all four areas and how they can get clogged number two is the center with coil displaced and not touching the contact pen so we're gonna use a special tool to recenter one or both coil wires and that is what you see here lastly are your wicks out of place if so you're probably gonna need to transfer the liquid from your cartridge to maybe another cartridge that's empty but still works so first and foremost I just wanna let you know I'm not an ambassador at all for kingpin butts if they want to bring me on board I clearly know what I'm talking about so mmm here's your product disassembled Kington and here are three of them put together you know I'm a thirty on this I've been reading the manual so I didn't read a book I didn't read a zine I didn't read a meme I just very curious about how things work so without further ado let's talk a little bit about point number one is the air flow disrupted all four areas so you might say what are the four areas well let's pick up this empty one I'm going to use this little pin for pointing purposes this is just paperclip and there are also many uses for this obviously specifically with these pens and the cartridges I should say first things first disclaimer do not stick this into here and all the way down do not stick it into the bottom and up and in because in the middle chamber you'll see there are two holes in this middle chamber which is the same as this middle chamber that I just knocked over this middle chamber is what is in sight at a glass tube this is a one-gram pen or one gram cartridge the two holes that you see right here and right here are blocked by a wick this is the wick here and the wick is wrapped around the coil so that's a little bit about the anatomy of what we have here this is the entire cartridge disassembled - the glass because I had to break the glass off once I screwed the top off the top does unscrew and will come off there are rubber washers in the middle there in the middle of the cylinder and there's a rubber washer on the outside so the rubber washer makes contact with the glass and the rubber washers here block any oil from moving up into the mouthpiece as you see it fits flush is the air flow disrupted the four areas are one the mouthpiece is a clogged we don't know the bottom is it clogged we don't know and then number three there are actually four holes next to the thread one two three and then four one area two areas and three areas the fourth area comes from the battery itself where the cartridge meets the pen battery there are four slots this is the use Oh oze pen also not affiliated with but if you guys want to bring me on board clearly I know what I'm talking about here we go this is the 650 pen 650 just tells you how much battery power is in this particular particular pen and there's also a voltage dial on the bottom so you can really dial in how much vapor you may potentially have because of how much heat will be transferred up into the cartridge and into the coil and then into the wick which will be full of your liquid content this is the fourth area if this areas blocks because you're holding it like a noob or some other person who has never handled one of these before you will be blocking the airflow from the two areas where air goes into which again are the four holes next to the threading or the bottom hole you can plug this hole and suck through the top because air will flow through the holes next to the thread you could theoretically plug those holes and then intake air through that bottom hole once you have your mouth on mouthpiece and are attempting to inhale is the airflow disrupted check all four areas you may have to use a flashlight and look inside of there a headlamp something but we suggest that you do not take off the little rubber nipples that they give you to protect your cartridge when you get these keep them on when they are not in use so that nothing does go in there unintentionally do not carry these loosely in your pocket because something could go in the mouth hole something you'd go into that bottom hole there the mouth hole could be clogged because maybe you've been using your pen for a long time you never cleaned it but as we see there there is a hole right down the middle it's nice and clear but we can also clean it I just use a paper towel and I just clean that's twist it up and clean it or you can use a pipe cleaner which is obviously a great tool for pipe like devices you can clean inside here and you can clean there make sure that that's good also too you know when you're opening your cartridge make sure you don't set it flat inside for too long like I just did because the contents might leak out but I had that off-camera nothing happened over here I didn't lose anything thank goodness because this stuff is expensive so what we're gonna do is gonna set that back down so that that liquid goes back down into the container then another area we check is that bottom that hole there a lot of people know that this part slides out and one of the problems the most basic thing that people say is when you just adjust this you pull this part out right here and all that and then inside of the battery the battery there that part has to touch that part right there and then you got to raise that part up and then you gotta raise that part and then they got to touch each other and like that that you know that's that's a thing sure but that's probably not gonna be your problem so you if that's what you're looking to do you could very gently raise this part up and you can very gently raise this part out you can kind of pluck it through the middle or you could just use your nail cuz your nail fits if it is that thin and you can see how it was once recess and is now not and I can even push it in gone flush dunzo doesn't need to be sticking out to make contact and for it to work how do I know it works because when I press my pen oh that's the actually the error code that's the does not work code so if you don't have it doesn't work for some reason that's great that that just happened because that brings you to a point number two so we already checked our air flow just messed up my whole stage here we're gonna check our air flow we did that at point one point two point woops 0.3 which is down here point three in point four which is when it's connected these pens so number two what does it say it says is the center wick coil displaced well I'm gonna cap this back up because that's just good habit good habits are hard to find put that right there this cartridge is relatively empty on purpose because this one wasn't working and I transferred the liquid into that one and on the way during that journey I found a couple of things this is level 2 all of the videos just deal with not even one they just deal with the does this part touch this part do they touch if not adjust that part or just that part that's fine cool but we need 50 people to make that video we need 50 people make this video and then 50 people to make this video in 50 people to make this video but luckily for you kingpin and furrows I am keeping people happy and satisfied so bring me on board because I'm tired of doing what I'm doing for living anyway where were we oh yeah fixing your product for people this cartridge has this and down here again this cartridge that I'm holding is the same as this right here this is the mouthpiece this is the metal middle cylinder which is down the middle of this glass and then you have a wick wrapped by a coil and a wick wrapped by a coil this wick is missing I tore it off intentionally then you have a rubber gasket and then you have a metal contact point this is the point that touches the battery inside of your pen this is this I know I'm over explaining things but a lot of people don't and also too you know a lot of people space out at the 11 minute and 40 second mark so good on you for staying involved moving on if you were to move this piece out of the middle what would happen it would fly out then you would expose the rubber gaskets is this rubber gasket the same as this yes that's what it looks like when you pull it out you pull out that way you look just like this boom so this is this and then that right there is that inside of here is supposed to be two little thin wires which are these two little thin wires and they would be connected to a wick in this case let's get that flashlight in that bad boy you could see one of those right there I'm gonna try to focus and get the flashlight on and just bear with me I know you don't like watching long videos but hey maybe your pen is broken and you're all bummed out and you're just being held hostage mr. informative over here because you know you want the thing to work because you have a desired effect in mind check it out there's one coil right there a one wire there should be two and if I personally look at it which is not gonna be helpful to you um I can see that the other wire is down in there put my flashlight away boom what I used was I went to my sewing kit yes sewing kit and I got this little tool this is for threading this is an assistant this is an assistant for threading go through the needle head go through the eye of the needle jeez Louise go through the eye of the needle and then you would put your thread into that part and then you pull it through that's what this is intended for but today it's for THC vaping products so that is a very thin gauge wire even more thin than that stuff down there how we get that out as we just kind of go fishing you can see that when we go inside of there the metal wire is hooked on the end conveniently and we can see that I have hooked onto that wire there are two of them though you gots to go get yourself another one and I'm very close to getting it I also don't want to waste a bunch of time because you might space out but lucky for you I got it they had two wires so this was the one that wasn't working I'm gonna see if miraculously this which I know this fixes it I just don't know if I can't kind of can't see what I'm doing and I'm just making this tutorial video just to show you what to do so once I put my peace back in and it's gone flush up against those metal coils I try it back again this is against for problem number two and once I put it back on there if those wires are flush this will just stay lit normally it won't give me that weird blink code so let's just see what happens boom it lights up normally just fixed it in your face contracts in my Inbox what do we got moving on don't just love it when you watch a video and everything works accordingly because the person that's teaching you is an expert alright sorry that's the last time I'm gonna do that I'm just really happy you should be happy too because these are the really expensive things and when they don't work you can give you really bummed out I read that in an article because you know I don't do this kind of stuff that's that we'll move on to problem number three now oh and then so that tool that's just like a sewing kit tool we covered that you're not gonna get with tweezers tweezers are big and chunky you know how big they're I'll show you and I'm back here our tweezers you think that's gonna get in there inside that teeny tiny hole you ain't getting in that hole tell you that much right now boom good luck with those big fat tweezers getting inside that little hole it's just not gonna happen and this is probably the only tool you'll have that's even close to what you need and you're gonna say well it's the only tool I have I'm gonna make it work you're gonna mess it up you're gonna mess up something and if you do mess something up well something's gonna happen it's probably going to be step number three are your wicks out of place in that case you're probably going to need to transfer the liquid and that's what happened to me I had to transfer the liquid from this one to this one because those coils that are attached to that wire that we just pulled with this tool got knocked out of place if you look at this sorry right there that is the wick it is wrapped around and around and around by this little wire so wire comes up wrapped around round round round round round round and then it comes back down that wire one set is on the outside of this rubber washer the other set is inside the rubber washer the inside set is the one that we just did on that cartridge with this tool that's one that we just plucked out of that was in the middle this sensor cylinder would have inside of it you see right now that is a clean hole this again would be attached to the mouthpiece on this side and on the bottom this is what would screw into the bottom of the bait pan except for it's missing one thing what is it the glass I had to break the glass off because yes it's open on the one end but on the other end it's molded into place I believe so I broke I broke it off for the demonstration in this video so that you don't have to go injuring yourself or somebody that you love we're at 18 minutes now this is the metal sumela this is a middle cylinder all the airs are staying in I don't care I'm a professional middle cylinder clean hole it wouldn't be a clean hole though because it would be one two wicks blocking the view of the bottom that hole will be occupied by the two wicks if you held it over a flashlight remember a flashlight familiar I'm gonna blind you for a second to demonstration if I cover this hole and just plug this little bad boy right in there we should see Hey look at that we could see through there and there are some obstructions it is not as clean and open and empty is this again we're looking right here if it had fluid inside of that cylinder it wouldn't be a clean light what color would the light be you guessed it it would be this color we would be able to see down the middle if there was fluid leaking into that middle cylinder so the middle cylinder could get clogged because one of the wicks have been moved out of place somehow and that might have been our fault earlier using this little tool or maybe something happened during shipping or maybe this little metal piece went up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down too much or maybe we dropped it or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of pennies or maybe it wasn't a pocket full of posies we don't know what the case might be but for whatever reason fluid is now going into those holes and again what are those holes for those holes have the wicks inside of them they go straight across the fluid goes into the wicks the wicks are wrapped with coil the coil gets heated by an electrical current from the battery the battery makes contact with this metal piece which is this metal piece right here and on the inside of this metal piece are two wires that are attached to a coil which is it wrapped around a wick and on the outside of the rubber washer which is now here is another set of wires if any of those wires are displaced you will get a blinking code which we saw earlier if those wicks are out of place you will have drainage wreckless a drainage into the middle cylinder this fluid will start to fill up this compartment with fluid and it will sound very Slurpee and wet and bubbly when you take a draw from your mouthpiece the oil can leak out of the mouthpiece and the oil can leak out of the bottom and potentially the oil could leak out of the air holes all of which equal a gurgling Slurpee sounds when you draw on the cartridge so if your wicks are out of place you're gonna need to transfer the liquid so what I did was I took the cartridge that was good let's pretend this was the good cartridge it's empty for the most part I put the cap back on why so I could stand it up without a fallin over which it may anyway but if you have a good level surface it's gonna stand up straight but before I did that what I actually did was I unscrew the top to make it open and ready to receive new liquid that is what it looks like again do not get any liquid into this hole that shouldn't it be nice and clean the only thing that we should go in through that hole is the vapor of your oil once it is heated up by your coil heating element there so I've got this open I've gotten a nice flat service it's ready to receive I hope I took the cartridge that I wanted to empty the contents out of let's say this was a cartridge that was broken for some reason and it wasn't lighting properly and the maybe the coils are pushed in maybe I'm getting some other weird blink code maybe I just I did steps 1 & 2 it's not working I'm just going to get this cotton get the content out of here and put it into this other cartridge so what I did was I also unscrewed its top note there's a rubber washer to go flush up against the glass and they're rubber washers here on the middle cylinder that will go flush up against the mouthpiece as you see so that the contents won't leak up into the mouthpiece once I have my two cartridges disassembled I'm gonna show you a side view you would be doing this straight up and down but I'm gonna show you side view so what I did was I touched I waited for all the fluid to go down into one side and then I heated it a little bit with a lighter so it became more more runny and then I ran it down the side let these two tips touch but not inside but just on the outside what enough happening was the fluid ran down touched this middle cylinder and it touched then this middle cylinder and this road right down the side and into the new vial once I got to about the empty point what I did was say it got nice and full like that we're just reversing here it got nice and full what I did was I set it down like that and I took the other cartridge so I can get the last few drippings out of it and I put it right on top and you're gonna say no way that's ridiculous what kind of factory ancient aliens countertops do you have over there and what kind of skills do you have I mean I might be an alien it's okay boom I just stack things on top of each other I can also stack tennis balls on top of each other golf balls you name it again kingpin looking at my inbox still nothing it's okay we get all day these two things go on top of each other then your fluid can leak down into the new cylinder what does that look like from a side view it looks like this they'll be sitting right on top of each other and that fluid will be dripping from this one to this one will go right down the middle we hope and if not I made this I just got this this is look up this is a piece of mail now this was a piece of mail mm-hmm so I took this is the clear part which would have you read it from the outside this is the part that the mailman had been touching I use the inside and then if you were worried about anything spilling but you wanted to contain it and get it back later I put it right on top of there and I done this the first time I I didn't know what to do you know I stacked them on top of each other like that cuz again skills to pay the bills and then any fluid that went down in here like that I was able then to us to just fold my piece of cellophane or whatever this is I fold it in half like that and then I just had my my fluid right there in the middle and then I just cut off the corner and then I just squeezed it out like I was doing them like some pastry design or something you know those like Baker's bag the icing stuff you see how like it beads up and you just move it down can you squeeze it down into the side of your cartridge depending on how much matters and means to you you know maybe $50 or $60 or however much you're paying is a lot or maybe it's not but an either way at either rate at any rate it's not bad to save your time to save your money and these things can be pricey and expensive so hopefully I answered some questions for you I know this video is 28 minutes long at this point so just a recap of everything they have here the sharpies were kind of pointless I was doing something earlier them the tubes for the cartridges the cartridges themself the pen by use Rosie II kingpin cartridges most awarded brands in history thus far these are mouthpieces this is the anatomy of the whole cartridge the mouthpiece the center the center piece their two coils with two wicks one wicked missings I removed it the rubber gasket and then the metal contact point that makes contact with the battery of the pen the battery so that's that I know this is helpful for you hopefully at this point if something else is wrong I'm not aware of it maybe leave some more solutions down in the comments below if you have any questions feel free to ask again my name is jay and i know this was helpful to you have a good day", "LWHkIXGHq-E": "welcome to the Kohler maintenance series is your spouts difficult to rotate is your spout leaking from the swivel point this maintenance project will show you how to measure your revival spout and replace the spout if it's leaking at the swivel point it should take 20 minutes to complete this project to find service parts online visit us Kohler comm for this project you'll need the following tools measuring tape plumbers wrench lock jaw pliers Phillips head screwdriver and Crescent wrenches to begin let's measure your spout one method is to measure the spout reach horizontally from the center of the base out to the water stream you can also measure the spout height vertically from the countertop surface to the aerator now we'll move on to replacing the spout first be sure you have flexible lines and not a brass yoke underneath your sink if you have a brass yoke you'll want to update your faucet to a newer model to ensure the replacement kit works with your system next you will need to determine if your spout swivels above or below the skirt if it swivels above the skirt order the spout retrofit kit if it swivels beneath the skirt order just the spouts replacement before continuing let's make sure the water supplies turned off to the faucet then disconnect the hoses from the spout shank now disconnect and discard the hot and cold hoses from the valve bodies remove the spray hose tighten the plumbers wrench around the shank and hold the pliers around the spout use the plumbers wrench to loosen the shank gently pull to remove the spout and shank discard them both now insert the o-ring into the discussion and slide the discussion onto the spout shank hold the spout and insert it through the mounting hole partially thread the screws into the ring thread the ring upward until the metal washer contacts the underside of the sink then connect the spray hose tighten the screws with a Philips head screwdriver place the o-rings on the tee connect the threaded ends of the hoses to the hot and cold valve bodies connect the hoses to the team turn the water supply back on check for leaks and then you're done", "_WGRnHG2M1w": "[Music] hey guys logan here from o to vape today we are going to take a look at a variety of 510 thread batteries and go over some features and functions they offer to see what might be the right battery for you oil vape pens come in many different shapes and sizes with an array of different features in resulting benefits to the user the sheer volume of options that are available on the market today can make it difficult to determine which style what features in what specs make a specific 510 thread battery right for you that being said we decided to compile something useful an extensive buyer's guide this way every customer can understand what is the right product for them and why so whether you are a discrete oil vape connoisseur choosing your next setup a vape shop owner looking to better educate your customers or an extractor who needs to ensure the right product for your next home sale order you can watch this video to get all the info you'll need to ensure an optimal buying experience let's start with the basics what is a 5-10 thread battery well a 5-10 thread battery is a universal thread design for a battery that will fit most all vape cartridges on the market can you use any 510 thread battery with any 510 thread cartridge well not really even though they will physically connect to one another you may not get an optimal experience or even an experience at all with certain setups for example most quality cartridges on the market these days are going to be a ceramic carton with a ceramic cartridge you will need at least a three point seven volt battery in order to give you an ideal hit if you use a battery that is under 3.7 volts it may still work however you are likely to get a very small hit whereas if you use the correct battery for the cartridge then you would most likely get a lot bigger draw here you can see our original buttonless battery even though you can physically screw a ceramic cartridge onto this battery the battery is only 3.3 volts and therefore when you take a draw you'd be getting a subpar head sticking with voltages some people like to change their voltage whereas others prefer a more simplistic option if you like the more simplistic option you can purchase a battery that stays on the same voltage in this case you'd most likely love either one of our fixed three point seven volt button or buttonless batteries which will power most all cartridges on the market there are no voltages that change here just screw on the cartridge and go others like to adjust the temperature settings other batteries so they can dial in exactly the hit or flavor they want here is an example of our variable voltage battery what that means is that you are able to adjust the voltage settings on this particular device why would you want to do that well when you operate a battery a lower voltage setting then you may not experience as big of a hit however you should get more flavor on the flipside he turned the voltage up higher to let's say four point eight volts then you'll certainly get a larger cloud however is likely going to be a hotter hit with less flavor in all reality you really do not want to blow out a huge cloud as you are a really absorbing less of what you're looking for from the oil that's in your vape when you are looking for a battery you will not only want to look at what voltage you think your that you want to operate at but you also want to look at the mah or the mah the mah refers to the battery capacity or basically how long that battery will stay charged in theory the higher the mAh the longer your battery will stay charged the reason I say in the theory is because there are different grades of quality with the batteries the difference between a high quality battery and a low quality battery can be an exceptionally hard to tell from a buyer's perspective the fact is there are thousands of manufacturers making batteries with different quality components and many of them do look the same a higher quality of a battery is going to give you more charges more consistent power ratings and hold a charge for longer the best way to tell if you are looking at a high quality battery or not is whether the seller stands behind their product since it is difficult to show the quality by opening up a battery to see what's on the inside we at o2 vape offer a lifetime warranty on almost every battery that we sell we hear stories from customers that come to us and say they have a drawer full of batteries and that they don't want to buy anymore well that makes sense because we know many of them have cheap components we usually tell them to throw them all out and come get one of ours that comes with a lifetime warranty another factor in choosing the right battery for you is concealability now the batteries that i've shown you so far what we call a pen style battery basically because their shape imitates that of a writing pen for some people this is the perfect option for others they want something that they can conceal better to stay under the radar here's an example of our patented flip platinum battery as you can see it imitates a key fob however if you hit the release button a cartridge will actually flip out of the side which also turns on the battery a couple of other great options from o2 vape are going to be our nano battery which fits right into the palm of your hand and also our decoyed battery which imitates a newer sleek style key fob I will say that all three of these models do offer variable voltage settings while also offering great mods not to throw you for a loop but the decoy unit is actually not a 5-10 thread battery it is what we call a pod system we also use what is called a pod instead of a cartridge as the term for the part that contains the oil pods do not have threads and will be seated into the battery by pushing it straight in and pulling it straight out the benefits of pods are going to be their uniqueness and concealability however the downside is you'll have to use a specific pod for your system for this you will need to make sure that you are able to purchase prefilled pods for your specific system or have access to what we call a dart or applicator that will allow you to fill your own empty pods hopefully now you have a better idea of the different styles of 510 thread batteries their features that set them apart and what might be the best option for you keep in mind that if you are using an O 2 v battery that you have peace of mind knowing that you will always have access to our lifetime

"OAMEvE2ixlQ": "There are two basic faucet installation\nmethods the most common for a pull down or pull out faucet which we will cover\nfirst and then for fixed faucets which we will cover in a few moments. Be sure to have your installation guide\nhandy as this has all the parts that are unique to your faucet and where they go. This is found on top when you open your\nfaucet box. You will need a pair of channel lock pliers an adjustable\nwrench, phillips-head screwdriver and the bucket. Your faucet is designed to fit a\nstandard sized hole diameter of one and three-eighths inches or 35 millimeters.\nYour faucet should have an old ring that fits into the base of the faucet or in\nsome cases the faucet base ring. Be sure it's in position before starting. If your\nfaucet has a base ring make sure that the faucet and all the hoses plus shank\ngo through the countertop hole and the base ring if present. From under the sink secure the hardware according to the\ninstructions. Rubber washer, plastic washer,  rubber and metal see washers and\nhand-tighten locked on bottom confirm the faucet is centered and then tighten\none turn with a wrench. Before you hook up your faucet it's important to make\nsure all fittings and valves are free of debris. Connect flexible supply lines\nindicated by blue strike for coal supply line and red stripe for hot supply line\ntwo valves on ball hand tighten and then tighten one additional turn with a\nwrench. Do not over tighten. It is recommended\nthat you flush the supply lines to remove dirt and particles that may\naffect the performance of your faucet and may board the warranty. To flush\nplace a bucket under the shank. Turn the faucet on and slowly open the cold water\nwall valve and flush for one minute. Close the cold water wall valve repeat\nthis process for the hot water wall valve. Thread hose adapter onto shank and tighten\nwith a wrench. Feed spray hose through hose guide if applicable. Attach the hose\nadapter and tighten with a wrench. Do not overtighten. To flush out any debris that\nmay be in the spray hose pull the spray head down and grasp the collar. Remove\nthe spray head, direct the spray hose toward the drain and turn on faucet. Let the water run through the hose for\none minute replace spray head. Attach the weight to the spray hose using\nrubber sleeve and screws provided. Position the weight two to three inches\nabove the bottom of the hose. Turn on faucet and check for leaks. To install a\nfixed faucet insert faucet in the countertop as you did for the pull down\nand pull out faucet then flush supply lines. Connect cold supply line marked\nwith a blue stripe to the cold water wall valve. Direct the hot supply line\nmarked with a red stripe into a bucket. Place the faucet handle in the neutral\nposition and turn the faucet on. Slowly open the cold water wall valve and let\nthe water run into the bucket for one minute. Repeat this process for the hot supply\nline. After both lines have been flushed be sure both lines are secure by hand\ntightening, then one additional turn with a wrench. Turn faucet on and check for\nleaks. For more information on our wide\nselection of faucet styles please visit blancoamerica.com", "fGwzqng9AOI": "[Music] hey guys dr. Shawn Mira VG here and it's time for another cannabis product review today I'm reviewing good Supply Blue Dream and this is a vape cartridge using the 510 system it's got a lot of good information even just on the box it says our oil what's inside cannabis distill a plant-based terpenes and the terpenes are quite nice in this one no additives which is what I like and premium ceramic core that sounds good anti leaked technology perfect don't want that leaking in direct airflow system alright so already I'm liking this product it's really kind of cool funky green color there's some good easy to read information on the box so this retails for $43 ninety five cents on the Ontario cannabis store it's got 75 to 83 percent THC meaning it's a quite a potent cannabis cartridge there's really no CBD in here it's a sativa dominant hybrid so a little bit about blue dream so blue dream is a really classic strain that originated in California it was made using two strains blueberry which is known for its sort of blueberry flavor owing to a sort of fruity terpene profile and a really classic sativa strain called haze it's so blue dream has been pretty much known for its sort of full body relaxing effects without being sedating now the licensed producer behind good supply is \u00e1free\u00e1 they're basically a giant here in Canada a huge licensed producer with a lot of brands under its name but good quality products I know a froyo well they're out of Leamington Ontario if anyone wanted to know and they pride themselves with this 509 step process which is basically just means there's they take five hundred and nine steps in they're sort of quality assurance program so everything's held up to a really big standard I guess 5:09 really doesn't mean much to the average person but I'm guessing if you went to their plant and they went through the whole system you'd be pretty impressed anyway so that's a little bit of the backstory about this so let's open it up I really like this box it's really cool so you open it up using these tabs so there's two tabs here so if you push them both in and then you can push the inside of the box out so really kind of sleek and cool and good child protective mechanism there and so your cartridge is inside here and you can just sort of bring it out and that's what it looks like it's got a nice heavy metal heavy metal alright a metal tip which you know it's got a good mouthfeel to it and of course just like all the other 5-10 oops 510 cartridges it fits into your battery just by turning it like this so there you go and then you're ready to go so about blue dream what really stands out about this particular product is the flavor so the flavor is very fruity notes forward it's very true to the blueberry ancestors of blue dream yeah probably one of the most fruity besides maybe the tangerine dream from San Rafael this would be the second most fruity vape I've tried now the effects pretty typical to a blue dream there's this sort of wave of kind of like hazy it just says the name suggests relaxation so I didn't feel particularly what should I say focused during the effects of this one it kind of makes your thinking a bit hazy and sloppy but at the same time it's very relaxing and other point to mention which I notice with this one is it's not sedating at all so I wouldn't recommend this for nighttime use cuz it might keep you up a bit unless you can augment it with something that's a little bit more sedating so yeah so that's pretty much it in a nutshell I'm gonna give this one hmm this is gonna be a tough one because I do like the flavour a lot I like the effects but I'm not crazy about the effects I'm gonna have to give this a seven and a half out of ten yeah a little bit shy of an eight just because the effects aren't my favorite and you know what it is is if I'm going to be taking a sativa that's not going to be sedating that you know is probably better for daytime use I want like I want to have a lot of focus a lot of energy I want to be able to get things done which is not really what this one brings to the table and maybe it's not what this one's designed for this one's really more about chilling and relaxing like during the daytime because it's not sedating but very relaxing so I think a seven and a half for me is fair some other people who want like a more chilled out experience will probably rate it a bit higher but that's what I'm going to give it all around a great product are really happy with the purchase oh yeah and I bought this from a new dispensary in my area of town called Miss Jones I want to just give them a shout out because the the store looks beautiful first of all and the staff was really friendly and I enjoyed talking with them so shout out to you guys at Miss Jones alright that's it for me I'll be back with another cannabis product review for you guys shortly", "37IFacV_D50": "what's going on youtube family triple baskets we're gonna be doing another video today for you guys i really appreciate all the supports you know all the comments and stuff you know i go through that all the time so really appreciate you guys man and if you guys haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i will leave all the information down in the description box below but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself um just got back from my dispensaries so so today i ended up picking up a platinum vape guys this is like one of the one that stands it out um it's the first time i've seen them in my dispensaries so i really you know i definitely had to try it out so i've never seen these around before um so if you guys ever had one of these let me know what you guys think about it it's like i said the packaging really caught my attention how it has a little cali you know little logo cut out right there and uh it's pretty dope so i ended up getting the gelato this one's around this cartridge is around 90 so it's one of the reasons i got it and gelato strain is always good you know they're always good they taste good and um so this cartridge was made like about last month or two the good thing about the boxes um it shows you the flavor on it it says it's earthy it's citrusy and it's sweet and it's known for relaxed happy creative uplifted energetic that's pretty dope you know shows the details on the box and stuff like that not that many boxes show that so that's pretty dope so i haven't smoked all day so like i'm just like trying to get high man it's like it's like 12 in the afternoon so it's kind of my waking break you know for my first time so there's ways to open it in the box but you know some some people just like to show the [ __ ] box open i'm always shredding my boxes open man they're supposed to be child proof and sometimes i can't open them by themselves so here we have a tube guys if like i said if you guys ever had the platinum vapes before let me know if you guys enjoyed it you know the price is pretty good on these cartridges honestly i paid like 31 it was 30 dollars flat but with like a dollar tax i think so that's pretty that's pretty cheap for a cartridge no i i don't i don't mind whether it's live resin or distillate you know before all this live resin it was just this is like cartridges and you know i don't mind smoking distillate it gets you high as [ __ ] and it's just it tastes good some people are like ah this list not good but you know i'll smoke this a little i smoke like resin it doesn't matter as long as it's good it tastes good that's all that that shouldn't matter so so this one's a gelato cartridge um i'm gonna go ahead and dry it just see if there's like some flavors in there or some [ __ ] honestly you don't you just get like a little taste to it flip ultra honestly this battery is hella good right now i've been using this um flip ultra for like the past couple weeks and it's been really good you know i had gone this better like a couple months ago and it's a pretty good battery you know it's a flip battery you know you can put it in your pocket and it has a lock on it so it won't [ __ ] flip open in your pocket and break so that's pretty good you know so here we have like so here we have the cartridge guys give you guys a close-up on that as you guys can see the little sticker the california logo sticker it's legit i'm just gonna go ahead and flip it over just to show you guys the quality on it gotta be thick you know i can't be running you guys know that and uh so here we have the battery i'm just gonna screw it on here try and get baked right now man i'm gonna hit the [ __ ] out of this pen so here we have the pan guys and um that's pretty dope though like once you connect it it shows you like the little posts so far on this battery i have 575 puffs so far that's like five cartridges ran to that [ __ ] so other than that guys hopefully you guys are smoking along with me i'm about to get hot as [ __ ] right now so cheers guys i'm gonna let you know i'm gonna let you guys know what this tastes like these batteries hit oh [ __ ] honestly these cartridges are pretty good you know they taste really really clean you know i didn't think they were gonna be as good just the simple fact that they were like 30 bucks you know i thought they're gonna be like 40 so that's crazy it tastes really really clean you know like on the packaging it says it tastes so on the packaging it says it tastes earthy citrus and sweet it's what it says back there i don't know if you guys can see but honestly that's what it tastes like it does taste really sweet and it does taste earthy so to be honest you don't really get like a citrusy flavor it just tastes really clean like an earthy flavor to it so it's pretty good you know i'm gonna go ahead and rip it some more big clouds right i don't know i don't know about you guys but the tip on these cartridges i really love those tips you know those round tips it just makes the cartridge more appealing and they hit way better i don't know that's just my opinion let me know what you guys think about that but i'm trying not to cough right now this cartridge is like 90 you know i'm just trying to hold my coffin i want to start coughing and [ __ ] off my bed on the videos you know it's just my schedule's kind of [ __ ] up right now but i'm still trying my best to bring out some more videos for you guys and uh like i said if you guys have it out of the snapchat go ahead and do so i'm more active on instagram and snapchat but if you guys would like to add both go ahead and do so but just has me going you know she has me high as [ __ ] already and i just took two hits it's around 12 in the afternoon so you know it got me feeling pretty good so and the reason i really like [ __ ] with distiller is just that some distillery cartridges have more thc in them than what a live resin would have like i was looking at cartridges right now my dispensary and most discs to the cartridges they range from like 80 to the high 90s you know compared to a light resin which which ranges from like the low 70s to high 80s you know it's kind of hard to find the live resin with like 90 in it you know i'm still on the lookout for those but other than that yeah there's like a [ __ ] little dish of the cartridges at my shop there's a lot of live resin but i never knock off distally you know there's people that say uh distill is bad but you know it's pretty good you know it depends on the cartridge you guys get and you know there's some cartridge to be honest there's there is some distilled cartridges that are not good i just give you a headache and it tastes like [ __ ] like fake this or like cheap you know but there's just some distillates that you know some companies really do spend their time to make them a little better and they are pretty good so you just got to go ahead and you just got to go ahead and you know start trying new brands that's what i do so like this was my first time trying the platinum vapes and i'm really enjoying it you know it gots me going cheers guys and this battery also if you guys would like to if you guys would like to purchase this battery i'm gonna go ahead and leave the information down in the description box so you guys go ahead and check it out it's pretty dope you know it's a flip battery and also comes with the little lock so you can't open it so like if it's in your pocket you're up and down at work it's not going to open and break up on you which has happened to me before and it's not good so it's dope it turns on automatically as you guys can see so that's one of my favorite cartridge batteries that i'm using right now selenius but other than that guys um i'm gonna be having some more hotbox videos soon for you guys i know i've been lacking on those two so oh [ __ ] i got the ac pumping right now this thing has me sweating man and as you guys can see it says 90 thc hopefully you guys can see that cartridge is really good so if you guys ever see these in this in the store go ahead and purchase one you know they're really good and for the price i paid 30 dollars flat for this [ __ ] guys and that's that's a good thing about living in california you know right here where i'm from in modesto california everything's cheap like a top shelf eighth is like 25 bucks if you want like an exotic uh if you want like an exotic eighth it's like 30 to 40 dollars max you know you know it's pretty dope you know but if you guys enjoy videos like this give this video likes don't forget to subscribe you

can be incredibly annoying and a waste of water but fixing a tap is surprisingly easy but always check with the manufacturer's instructions in case your particular tap is different you'll find a full list of tools and materials you'll need at the end of this video before starting it's a good idea to understand what you're up against if water is leaking from the spout you probably need to replace the washer if from beneath the handle then the o-ring will need replacing before you start make sure you turn the water off at the supply do this in accordance with your water supply and heating system then release the pressure in the pipes by opening the tap and draining off the water it's also a smart idea to put the plug into the sink to stop any small parts falling down the plughole there are generally two types of tap you might come across and we'll deal with each of these in this video a compression valve is a mechanical device inside the tap that controls the water flow in this style of tap a rubber washer at the base of the valve forms a seal to stop water flow if this washer wears away then drips can occur to repair remove the handle you might need to remove the handle cap first to access the screw then remove the handle to expose the valve now unscrew the cover using an adjustable spanner unscrew the valve and remove use a screwdriver to remove the washer and replace finally screw back in the valve and tap handle you ceramic valve taps use ceramic discs rather than washers remove the handle cap to expose the valve unscrew the valve using an adjustable spanner lift out the ceramic disc valve and check clean it or replace it if it's worn replace the valve then screw in place and fit the handle leaks from beneath the spout mean the o-ring will need replacing Oh rings are small circles of rubber that form the seal at the base of the spout to replace the o-ring in the spout loosen the nut holding the tap to the sink from below using a box spanner rotate the tap to get access and remove the grub screw at the back of the spout lift the spout out the o-ring is at the base of the spout prized ring off using a screwdriver you and replace when replacing the spout align the marker on the spout with the groove in the tap body then tighten the grub screw at the back and the nut holding the tap to the sink if the o-ring is damaged or worn it will need replacing to replace the o-ring in the valve itself use the technique previously explained to remove the valve depending on the kind of tap replace the o-ring and rebuild the tap as before using these simple techniques a dripping tap should be a thing of the past here is a list of the tools you will need to fix your kitchen tap depending on the method you use and here's the materials you will use you", "O-oShgS1Xy4": "hey what's going on guys welcome to deaf connection in this review I got the vessel batteries so the vessel battery is intended to use four cartridges only and primarily only four cartridges and honestly I love this battery beckham this is out of all the pens i've ever tried an experience this is honestly my favorite one this one is the smoothest the cleanest and um i can't find any con about it other than its price it is pricey compared to a lot of other batteries like cecil or like she saw Siler she saw palm and all that but and some of them even cost ten bucks but this one's really worth it you really do get what you're worth when you buy the vessel battery so there you let me tell you all the features this pen really is a is a really sleek pen and it really is that smooth and simple to use it's just three different modes um the lowest one being like being 2.8 volts right here and that's another thing too it's pretty cool do you need it's unique in the colors that it has I thought that was pretty nice but the last mode is a 3 point 6 volts I believe yeah pretty sure that's right at 3.6 so it's not as powerful as other pens as well but another thing is the batteries really efficient it lasted me a couple of days and it charges fairly fast charges it wasn't like one two three hours that will last me anywhere he's pursuing like I smoked consistently so I do it does last meeting between 2 to 2 to 4 maybe even 5 6 days so I think that was pretty awesome now with the battery with the battery itself like what I said honestly there really isn't a whole lot to it other than it's a sleekness how the feel of it this one this one's really nice actually I love this one will op up the only thing to the battery is um right here oh and there's another feature that I love about it it's the air flow this is what makes it amazing you see all this right here this thing you can actually take off but the purpose of that is for airflow is for to optimize and enhance their flow the taste and all that and it really does difference there are some carts so you could see in the post off if you read further below but there are actually some quests that don't even fit this but that's what the person is for so you could just take it off if the car is too why you're just too big to fit that's another cool thing you know something other this very has that you could take off is the bottom part but first I had no idea where to what to do with it but it was a little confused at first um but I didn't realize didn't tell you about more about it that the bottom part is actually for the purpose if you were to drop it because I've dropped my vessel battery a couple of times and it's actually I know what nothing came off no paint came off not really like major scratches anything at all but this pen can withstand like impact if you drop it or something like that so that's pretty cool it's this thing but this battery falls and like bends or something like that right here this will be the first of that just to take it off this is where you charge it really simply just connect it's a magnetic charge port but yeah that is a that's a that's pretty much all there is to it yep I forgot to mention so I what I said this is um this pen is really for carts only and um it fits any sort of 510 thread and another cool thing is these are actually meant for it it's enhanced Cecil cartridge it's so see so these Cecil cartridges are better cause supposedly for Cecil silo and Cecil palm battery but we personally believe it the vessel better hits a lot better than the Cecil batteries itself so that's another really cool feature and it looks just like if it's really smoothly guys it's like that thing too is pretty much as convenience and it's sleekness its discreteness and how it hits uh how it just enhances every hit it really you really get the taste of every single hit with the vessel battery I know I'm hated I'm gonna smoking right guys just see how you can see how its Cheers all right smoke isn't fairly thick it's kind of thin but it's still it's still kind of rip so doesn't rip as much as I'd like it to but it's pretty much it's pretty much all deficient semen so it does less like what I said it just lasts a long time in every hit you really do it it really just tastes a lot better like actually with this cartridge itself to some of the carts I tried it with my other batteries um I tried it with the G pen and stuff like that and it was the only actually really harsh this actually gives this really smooth hit so that's another really cool thing so that's the that is a vessel better you guys if um another thing is I forgot to tell you the price yet it is worth a hundred bucks so I mean it honestly like what I said you usually do get what you what you pay for this thing is really worth it if you've got smoke cartridges a lot and consistently if you're more of a wax kind of person or just like prefer smoking and smoking weed or anything like that then yet I wouldn't recommend this pen but I do recommend is battery for everyone who small carts on a consistent basis so that's the vessel battery um if you guys have any questions or comments and experience with it posted them post them down below and I'll see you guys soon peace out guys", "HS1KtdWcwmI": "what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my

"I have this Moen kitchen faucet it's one of those high art pulled down single handle faucets and it was dripping at the handle so I needed to fix it first thing you want to do is turn off the hot and cold water to the faucet so I'm gonna go ahead and replace the cartridge and the first thing you need to do is turn the handle so you can get to the hex nut that holds the handle on to the faucet a hex nut is usually covered with a little decorative plug just pull that out so go ahead and grab your hex wrench and loosen the hex nut and then the handle will just come off now you can see the cartridge in there yeah the next thing you need to do is to have this decorative cover that goes over a cartridge just unscrews most of the single handle Moen faucets use the same cartridge as the Moen 12:55 and you can get it at any hardware store so this is what comes with the cartridge to get the cartridge the nut that holds cartridge in place a hex wrench and the hex screw to remove the cartridges take your wrench and this in the the nut and then the cartridge will come out now go ahead and stick in the new cartridge it only goes in one way there's some grooves in the cartridge that will only allow you to insert it one way so once you have the cartridge and sort of go ahead and put the nut that holds the cartridge in place go ahead and screw that back in and then tighten it with your wrench again don't make it too tight but you want to have a fairly snug and then go ahead and put on the decorative cover again screw that on and then slide the handle back on and tighten the hex nut and be sure it operates smoothly and go ahead and turn on your water again and then test out your boss to check for any leaks and that's basically it pretty simple to do I think most people can do this and it's been working great so no more leaks I hope it works out for you guys", "6cmI6BwLog8": "hey guys Logan here from o2 V gonna show you today how to fix a connection plate we get a lot of calls coming in with customers who think that their battery is broken when they go to draw on the cartridge it appears the battery's working but they're not getting a vapor from the cartridge generally when this happens it tends to be the connection plate so what I have here is one of our push-button 510 thread batteries if you look down in between the threads with the cartridge off in the middle you see the circular connection plate so what happens is that generally gets pushed down when either a you screw the cartridge on too tight or be when you go to screw the battery on to the charger and screw that on too tight so a very simple fix what we often tell people to use is just a paper clip and if you stick the paper clip in between the connection plate and the threads and you just pry towards the middle it starts to raise that connection plate up be very careful because it comes up extremely easy you don't think of it a lot of pressure what you're gonna do is you're just gonna walk around the battery and bring that whole plate up to about the middle of the threads once you go to put the cartridge back on after this you should have a good connection and your bad we should be working in it thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "bArnVbQVRdQ": "federal authorities are cracking down on dangerous materials on airplanes and the latest

the transferring a3 cartridge this is a cartridge that features a hidden silica wick heating chamber as well as an all glass and metal exterior construction to begin disassembling this cartridge to prepare for filling it's very simple all you have to do is unscrew the metal mouthpiece with a few twists you'll see that it simply disconnects with a simple pull up from the cartridge itself leaving you with just an empty cartridge and the mouthpiece now to begin filling I suggest that you use a blunt tip syringe and with all transferring USA orders one is included and the reason it's blunt tip is so that it's safe to use it cannot pierce skin and features a 15 gauge needle tip gage refers to the actual thickness of the needle and you don't want to go any bigger than 15 gauge or else it won't fit down inside of this cartridge to begin filling now the one special thing to note with the a3 cartridge is that it does not have a center post to fill through this center post right here is actually the air channel what you want to do is fill to the side it is a side filling cartridge so to begin filling you want to place your needle to the side of the center post but but inside the glass once you have your needle placed correctly to the side of the center post simply begin pushing your material inside don't go too fast cause you don't want it to overfill and as you approach your desired volume simply withdraw the needle and this is very important as with all cartridges you want to make sure that you cap within 30 seconds of filling and to cap simply place the mouthpiece on push it down and begin twisting in a clockwise direction to tighten it once it is completely tightened you now have a filled cartridge and there's only one more step if you have done a hot fill meaning that the material in your syringe is actually hotter or has been heated up hotter than the outside ambient air temperature if you're performing a hot fill what you want to do is immediately after capping and filming flip the cartridge upside down and store it in that position for the next two to three hours what this will do is drive the air bubble that normally would have been on the bottom and you can see this one rising here up to what is now the top which is the bottom of the cartridge here this allows the air bubble to vent to the outside atmosphere and expand and contract without pushing back and forth into the heating chamber again this step is only important if you have done a hot fill if you have done a cold fill or you've injected material that is the same temperature as the outside atmosphere this step is not necessary you can then just place your cartridge right side up and begin using it however if you have performed a hot fill it is very important that you flip your cartridge upside down after filling for two to three hours to let it cool down and that's it [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music]", "W68Up_cSIco": "hello hello what what oh there

Instagram real Maddie smokes follow me there guys and say you came from this video and yeah alright guys I'll see you guys soon okay okay yeah yeah bye", "60H-rAHWXWA": "yo what is going on everybody welcome back to another video with your boy sebby g man ding literally before i turned on my camera i was sitting on my desk and i looked at the date and i was like yo literally the year is going to come to an end already bro and i feel like this year i i feel like i could speak for everybody but this year has been super super super crazy i feel like me personally i had a lot of ups i had a lot of downs but you guys know man this year 2020 was definitely a crazy turn for i feel like of the majority of us all right guys so without further ado guys we're hopping into today's topic which is i'm gonna be i'm going to be presenting to you what i believe to be the best cartridge battery out in 2020 okay so as a cartridge viewer you really do end up trying so many different products in terms of batteries and stuff like that and me personally in the year 2020 i feel like i've tried literally over 50 batteries and in my videos i don't choose to show every single one of those products i like to minimalize it and really show you guys the only ones that i feel are worth it so the one that i felt like was more worth it this year the one that really caught my attention the most that really saved me when it came to cartridges was this battery right here all right guys so this one right here is called the toki 510 thread cartridge battery and it's one of my favorite batteries man it has so many features from wireless charging all that good stuff but the main feature that i like the most is the fact that it saves your oil so much more than any other batteries guys just because of the fact that it has a five to six um second draw limit i believe and i don't know what they do in that drop but literally you still get those super fat milky clouds so you're really not missing out on anything right so i'm gonna go ahead and take a hit for you guys i got myself a little live resin cartridge sitting nice and pretty on here so without further ado cheers guys like i said you still get those super fat clouds that you need in order to get super super big this battery right here literally has saved me from having to buy so many cartridges guys like literally i did the math and let me show you guys for an example right so this one right here is the alpine live resin cartridge the last time that you guys saw this on a video was i believe two to three weeks ago maybe a little bit more and guys i've only been using it on this battery after that video so every single time that i take a hit it's off of this toki battery and i must say that after three to four weeks of having this cartridge look at the oil look at the oil literally one of the things that they pride themselves in is being able to conserve the consumer's oil and i think that's super amazing because they actually did it man they actually found a way to adjust the battery so it's not overheating your oil and it still gives you the perfect hit but with that being said man i think literally they probably saved me at least a couple hundred to a thousand dollars this year just off of their battery alone and the fact that i could literally just still be using these cartridges on the daily without having to waste them within a day or two using that on the blue setting now we're gonna go ahead and hit it on the purple setting me personally i feel like the purple setting on this battery is the best setting to get the perfect super nice milky clouds and it brings out the terpene profiles out the most because it's a higher voltage but for me i like the hotter hits that way i could get baked a little bit more easier alright so without a doubt cheers [Music] oh my gosh dude one of the best things this year has to be the fact that a lot of companies came out with live resin cartridges and i must say man live resin really is a game changer from going to disney to live resident is super super phenomenal man just because i feel like live resin has such a better taste than dislike does and aside from the battery itself guys they also provide you with literally just about everything that you can possibly need when having a cartridge session all right so first off i'm gonna i'm gonna show you guys what the first products were when they launched the battery but they have the portable charger right here usually you could use this with your phone but i think the better way to use it is whenever your cartridge is dead on the go you can always keep this portable charger in your car and literally just use it and never have to worry about a dead battery again the next product is going to be something that literally no one no one has done and turkey was the first one in this game from what i've seen to be the first to introduce this right here this right here is a wireless portable charger all right guys so pretty much all you have to do with this is you just have to line it up with the toki symbol and then it's going to start charging for you which is phenomenal man because i don't know how many times i have i i personally hate having to plug in chargers sometimes i can't even find my charger so being able to just leave this as at your desk with the convenience of just boom plopping it on top and it instantly starts to charge that's super super super satisfying for me super minimalistic not having to carry around a charging cable with me everywhere i go and um yeah man i love this this probably has to be one of my favorite things that they've released all right guys and last up on the list guys we have the most newest addition to the toki family which is this bad boy right here this is the toki 510 wax cartridge and you're thinking like whoa they sell wax cartridges too yes they sell wax cartridges but it's not your normal wax cartridge this one right here is a super high grade material wax cartridge it doesn't have any distillate or wax already in it basically you attach it to your toki battery and then inside it has its own little coils right there i think i still have some wax in there from the last video i made on it has some coils right there on the bottom and literally you could just be taking dabs or you could be hitting your cartridge right guys so the fact that they came out with this attachment in the year 2020 was super super phenomenal man because i feel like the year 2020 was the year that a lot a lot a lot of tech for the cannabis community came out and i was super super happy to get my hands on this one right here because i feel like like i said this is the best battery of the year 2020. it saved so many cartridges for me they brought so much more diversity with these wax cartridges right here with the portable chargers definitely my favorite brand of the year 2020 all right guys so now that i told you my favorite battery of the year 2020 i want you guys to tell me what your favorite battery is right so i'm going to be replying to everybody down in the comments below guys if you enjoyed today's video do me one last favor smash the like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe button alright guys i'm going to take one more hit for you guys i hope you guys i'm not really too sure when this is

you guys have an amazing new year and we'll catch you guys on the next video", "Tz50RBGv2xQ": "I must show you this real try some more the strawberries taste like strawberries the snozzberries taste like snozzberries what's going on everybody so I want to do this review it's just some stuff that just came into the dispensary ride from down for me this is by the the clear concentrate confidence it's called to clear this is a banana cream these are for bait cartridges they fit through your basic 510 thread so the two kinds that I've tried so far from them have been the banana cream which I pretty sure I think is I'm pretty sure is banana OG the strain but it does taste like bananas and the blue razz is is that as blue dream that tastes like raspberries and then it does have the taste so first of all let's talk about content and medicinal as you can see it's definitely been refined it's a nice clear color that you know so it's not dark and gar so it's got a nice clear color I will tell you this the first few times that I hit it again this is your typical wick cartridge system but they have fixed the cartridges a little bit better on these to where there were used to be a problem down here at the bottom with the metal which would be a they would leak and be they were really weak so they kind of sucked like as far as if you put them in your pocket or anything like that so they've kind of worked a little bit on these um I was able to put them in my pocket and my jacket and I didn't have any problems these ones the banana cream and this one the purple Rhys I can tell you this it took about let's see I would say five really really good drawers and I was like stupid medicated to just basically it to me basically just to kind of get doing what I needed to do or go around about my day that kind of stuff I went talking basically it took me just a couple drawers I used one of my other another one of my attachments which is kind of like a cigarette thing where you just pull on it you don't have to push a button or anything and I still got huge huge drawers out of this so this is a this product right here so FAR's medicinally as far as taste and everything else I would give it a big thumbs up this is pretty good now I want to tell you this these are $60 they don't specify how many milligrams was in here or any that kind of stuff as far that kind of stuff so I would assume that these are a grand they look like they're about a gram so anyway but these are sixty bucks apiece I don't know if they're nug Ron trim Ron's or the devil se but one thing too is that there's some of the other ones really you know the terpenes the flavor and them kind of burns the back of your throat well not these ones these ones it's very subtle you barely feel it and anything but so if you get a chance to try these out I would definitely highly recommend them it's the clear they have about 15 or 20 nor 20 other different flavors so if your dispensary as the opportunity to get them in you might be able to get them cheaper in your area so close to live in a prohibition area so again check them out the clear cartridges for vape pens awesome Lumpy's chicken grease amen try some of this it's absolutely dynamite", "X57hkIS65UU": "what's up everybody's a boy mastermind here wild cannabis life and we're back with another review video today we're talking about Buckeye release brand new product in partnership with the company called air pro these are 500 milligram or 1/2 gram babe cartridges so let's go ahead and jump in let's begin another mastermind here [Music] all right so let's start out with an unboxing here of at least one of the batteries in one of the cartridges and we'll talk a little bit more about it as we go I'll give you some more information let's jump in okay what you're looking at is an arrow pro advanced vapor system battery which comes in a nice box here as you can see and you get a carrying case in the USB charger and user guide that's a 320 milliamp battery this is in partnership with Buckeye relief so basically you know one thing that they're doing is they're offering a one-year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the all their vape cartridges all their vape cartridges come in 500 milligram leak free ceramic etat autonomous these are designed specifically for marijuana oil in our field with the following robust terpene profile so they have three different product lines the strain series which is high quality for technical terpenes formulated to replicate some of our favorite strains the live flower series which is 100% cannabis oil firm formulated with him to ride terpenes and also the live resin series which is high-quality fresh frozen live resin for the strange series they have three different ones they have jack herer which is a sativa blue dream which is a hybrid and Northern Lights which is an indica for the live flower series they have blue widow which is a high rip purple Hindu which is an indica and super silver which is sativa and last for the live resin series they have oral Blanco cocoa and straight saws the oral Blanco is an indica the straight salsa sativa and the cocoa is a hybrid so they have a pretty good variety as you're seeing with the battery as I'm showing you here it's this one is purple but they have a couple of different colors it basically is for regular micro USB chargers you're seeing and this clear piece that you're seeing here at the top that is actually a dummy tip so you basically had to remove that so so now I'm showing you the actual purple hindu vape cartridge and as you can see it's color-coded with the blue indica label and this as you see is a live flower series and you can see the test information right there and as you can see this package is sealed so I haven't opened it yet but I'm opening it for you guys in this review video and you know I think it's interesting that they're offering a one-year warranty and they're also with the battery and a 30-day warranty with the vape carts let me know if you ever come across another vape cart or vape battery that comes with a one-year warranty I think that's a little bit different you know this particular company is it's been around for at least a couple years the box was dated 2018 so it's not a brand new battery company yes so this particular vape cartridge has a magnetic bottom so there is no thread so this will not work on any other 510 batteries that you may already have laying around the house so as I'm showing you here that you have to pull off this top piece and then you can see in there chamber there it is the magnet in there you pull off that clear piece it's kind of like a dummy tip once you clear that off then you can put the other part of the cat the cap I call it the cap back on and it won't work unless you have that cap back on there properly so at first I try to put it in without the cat pointer that didn't work out so well so you have to have this purple part that I'm showing you now all the way on there so even though it's a little bit of purple showing I actually don't have it all the way push down but once you drop it in there the magnet sucks it right into it so it is connected instantaneously even if you turn upside down the cartridge will not fall out so again I think it's very interesting that this particular VAE cartridge has a 30-day warranty and the battery has a wonder one year warranty so if you've seen another product like this in Ohio definitely let me know in the comments but I think this is the only product that I'm aware of that has a 30-day warrantee on the vape cart itself and a one-year warranty on the battery so I think that's pretty interesting so I'm gonna go ahead and let you guys see what it's like for me to hit it and so here we go alright so definitely again I love the color and just to show you guys now close you can see that this is seated properly so all I do is just take a tote and right off I can taste some really great flavors taste fruity now something else I like about this is there's actually choke hold car by calm joke hold the carb hole so if you want to make it if you want to adjust the air flow there's a little hole there and that will affect the airflow that you get and so that makes a difference with the CBD it's definitely gonna have a good benefit for paying you're looking for something with pain you definitely want to get something that has CBD in it again like I was showing you an unboxing with the case it just kind of fits right in there and that's kind of easy as far as you just put your charger in there and I don't know you might take your dummy cartridge with you heck you might have another cartridge and you might have a setup like this you could have like a nice little medication pack going on I think that's cool and I like it they actually give it a little instruction menu that shows you exactly how to use the product I think that comes in quite handy and as far as you know I also have the oral blanco live resin one and I can tell you this tastes great this tastes like oral Blanco and I mean this this is one of my favorite pens so far in the whole program I love the color tips I like colors I like to the fact when you hit the battery or vibrates and like I said as far as prices goes they have three different price points 60 65 and 70 the 70 is the highest one for the live resin live resin cause a lot more to process than the basic THC oil and you know I just wanna let people know that I do a lot of reviews and I always hold on to my receipts and I think everybody in the program should be keeping their receipts and their containers just in case something ever happens you never know if this is gonna be a recall on something or an issue and since they're offering a one year warranty on the battery and a 30 day warranty on the actual cartridge it's definitely a good idea to hold on to the receipt and even here I've put my labels on the back so that's something you guys might want to start doing but definitely keep your receipt no matter what for at least up to one year and if you just can't keep paper receipts in there just want people don't like keeping that land around take a really high resolution photo with your phone or go ahead and scan it that's something I can recommend as well because that will always give you a digital record of when you buy it which you bought and then if you ever have to scrimp so you can prove that you actually purchased the item and that you paid for it so I think it's important to keep your receipt just want to touch base on that what you didn't see in me in the review was the other package is different where the alive resin it's a gold Cullen I already opened that one and that unboxing didn't go to where I wanted it to so I couldn't show you that one on camera but like I said it's very very good and it's worth every penny that I paid for it you know I definitely purchased the next the Coco one to try that one as well to see if it's just as tasty so with that I'm gonna tell you if you like what I did in this video make sure you like subscribe button I'm trying to get to 1,000 subscriber I can't do that what your support so many visit subscribe button right now make sure you check out my website Debbie that without Ohio

out to our growing therapies in Newark their service was great I also wanna let you guys know I think pure Ohio wellness might have had some as well I can't confirm it was on their menu at one point but you know how these things when they're new when they're good they go fast so again with them I'm gonna go ahead sign off I'll see you guys next time another mastermind here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "wWN8KL2KLvQ": "although friends have we doing it's been a decently long time since I did a video I apologize for that you know it's just like anybody you sometimes you struggle with content that one of release really good content so it's just been a few minutes since I release and stuff today's video I get a lot of questions about is what are we going to do with your leftover carts and we get a lot of these you know questions about these cartridges there's so many of them there's a bunch of different ways they connect together and really but it's really quite simple you can definitely get inside the carts even if there's a lip just a little bit of oil less than that we want to make sure we're using all that yeah this is a very expensive program and using all your medicine efficiently is really what's going to make that make or break it one month to the next without further ado you're gonna need a few things so I got what I did is I put a hook up excuse me a couple different cartridges together just show you different brands who we got here we got standard forms brand cartridge we got GTI brand cartridge and then we have a Terrapin brand cartridge right these are simple they just screw off they're not hard I'll do one for you right now this particular one is GTI and you just squeeze here and rotate righty-tighty lefty-loosey real easy to way to remember don't you get that off that's your trash this is what you're going save now some of you might be wondering what in the hell are you gonna do with that that that's gonna be worth my medicine there's a got a lot of things you can do you could soak it alcohol you can soak it in warm dump MCT oil or like tonight what I'm going to do tonight is I'm gonna heat up a little bit of high fat milk on the stove and once it's up the temperature I'm gonna drop like no no like 10 of these and there mix it together you'll start to see the milk turn like you know an amber color if you use the llars or the co2 carts how about them light tint to it that's your indicator that nicely you know this is already smoked up you know and you just kind of stir it in there you know not overheat this is something we made out of so it does get warm so it's okay to begin something that is warm you know you don't want to go ahead and throw them in the milk turn the milk on high and boil the cart in the metal together I don't recommend that I always heat up my milk and one for my milk is that temperature which is just slightly similar in our a little bit of bubbles I'll go ahead and throw it in there I'll mix that together add a few little bit of a chocolate then I'll mix that together but that's in a different video we'll do that specifically for the other brand cartridges like let's see we got here like your moxie carts or your LLR carts yes Koecher tangi whoa love it best corn ever and then you got your where these that's your outage this is your another one of those Cresco carts as well all right so we got that banks are you know what to say in a christelle cart this is actually a grassroot cart so these three carts here have compression fittings and this is why you're going to need these two tools and the two tools I'm speaking about today it's just like pair of vise grips pair of needle-nosed that's all I'm going to show you how I'm going to take this apart let's move this camera down here to see these guys are able to see what's going on on the table alright so once I've worked with a lot are these crest coats like I said kosher tangi you know sorry everybody all character changing is my favorite cartridge in the whole program it's amazing if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you check it out we're gonna want to do this right where that strip is you're going to get that in your vice grips now if when you initially put that down there I can't squeeze that it's too tight you don't want to squeeze it too tight so then you're just gonna loosen this up which is gonna allow you to lock that end see that and without holding it it's gonna not fall out and we want it to not be able to be wiggled either because if this is you can wiggle this that means it's not tight enough even if there's a little bit of play in there we want to make sure you got as much tightness as possible you know without squishing it okay so that's how that's going to look and then you can try a couple different ways you can put it on here and just work your way back and forth slowly but surely you don't want to squeeze this metal piece here bat metal piece if you squeeze that a bunch of times you're gonna make it hard for yourself I come out here or what I do another good trick is to stick your needle nose inside there put a flap down on the table and just give it back and forth little Wiggles stabilize your base of your car just so if it becomes an issue you can get it out what I like to do is increase the tightness on the court remember you don't want to squeeze you don't want to squish it and then and as you can see I'm squishing the crap out of the top of that but sometimes that's what's needed if you just wiggle back and forth boom off cam your piece and as you can see the end is good and I squeezed out of there and now I can gain access to all my compression fitting carts with all my medicine in there and that's what that end piece looks like I know you ladies are gonna ask me where I where I got this sweet little robber thing for the car actually a buddy of mine and 3d printed it for me my man Eman you're the man dude thank you so much that's awesome all right so just dump gonna do one more a couple one more here with these twisties just so you can see it up close just kind of twist it that's it if that has a bunch of stuff on there you can even throw that in just don't throw any rubber in and buy rubber you'll see like that sometimes I had this little rubber piece or they come on the bottom you don't want to go thread up and there don't kind of get in your way I know another one of the carts that have a big problem is these Moxie carts I'll do one more of these just to show you squeeze it right there clamp it down stick your partner map there we go squeeze the crap out of that hmm actually the moxie was easy easier to get often the crest Gallic has like it's like a little rubber piece so it just kind of flexed off on me which is nice that's pretty cool now you just kind of repeat this process until you get a bunch of carts opened any stuff you can move away from the top you feel free to do so but all that hot liquid is gonna get inside these carts so you can just leave these open like that and believe it or not there's another thing you can do now I don't recommend anyone just doing this but you can definitely get one of those extractor kits with the hollow needles and just suck up as much oil as you can honestly this is I've did that before this is still the best way I've ever figured out how to use my empty carts it's very efficient people are gonna ask me what's your dosing size generally when I do this I'm doing this on a Saturday or day I know I'm gonna have off I'm gonna do about five to ten carts that have a little tiny bit of oil if you get one like especially the standard forms ones oh wow I caught that you see how much of that is up there that's a lot of will right so maybe on this batch if I have something that has that thick that much oil at the top caked on there I might drop it down one or two carts just cuz I know it's gonna be pretty strong that day you know and then you know like I said I'll be making more videos and I want to definitely make a video on how to actually put these in some form of edible or drink and I will definitely be doing a video that in the future so thank you every much everybody thank you for watching take care of yourself and each other and hang loose", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "KJcjYTArjIw": "hi guys under here from Essex UK UK thanks for joining us today we're will be looking at how to clean your vape pen just a quick short video just to show you how to clean various pens we'll be looking at a standard Eagle where you just replace the head normally and also a slightly more advanced vape pen with replaceable coils in in the in the middle just to show a few extra tips basically on how to prolong the life of your vape and the main reason for keeping them nice and clean and tidy and so oh yeah so you will need a few things to start with first being cotton buds or q-tips whatever you want to call them next paper towels pretty essential really and also what I would recommend is a nice bottle of of just warm water well that'll do you nicely I've come across this that came in and another ecig kit which works perfectly it's got a nice fine tip so you can spray with it and it's very squeezy so if you've got one of these that come in very handy if not just use one water straight out really tough so let's crack on okay so let's start with the the Eagle tea setup here so this is standard pen with the replaceable end with your wicks in so normally what you'd do is you'd smoke this with a any liquid in the recommend that you don't really change your liquids using the same cartridge I don't have that much of an issue with it as long as it's quite empty but there is another way so they start by taking a report intake can remove the battery for now put the battery to one side so what we can do on the the atomizer side of things you can take your you tip off so you would normally fill it straight up through there and I've got a bowl here I'll just use this too to keep the little bits and bobs in so that's as far as this one breaks down it doesn't break down any further than that so you would normally just replace this or have a few spares so what I find is if you take your warm water in a squeegee bottle like so and just squirt it down inside and put your finger on the end and give it a bit of a shake then just discard the rest in here and do that a few times try not to overfill I can get the stuff down the middle in fact what I'll do I'll put the end on it's probably a better way to do it and give it a good shake again you can see the wicks are starting to come nice and clear all of a sudden it really works well it's quite an effective way you know maybe you've come to the end of an e liquid and you have another one and you just want to quickly give it a nice clean it's perfect where to do it so you can see all the the residue coming out here I think you can't anyway there you go so that's pretty much it so what I would do now is take a paper towel and just give it a nice wipe down and then ideally what you want to do is kind of try and shake out as much of that water as possible because obviously the more water you've got in there when you fill it with a liquid it will dilute so you can check out as much as possible it's quite a bit coming out there when I'm shaken into the ball but it's now running clear you can see that the the wicks inside are fairly clear they're not yellowy color off the the yellow liquid that I had in there there's still a bit of water in there I wouldn't worry about that too much you might even be able to get a cotton bud in to some elements of that too to dry it out a little bit I'll just leave it with the top off and leave it for an hour or so and that'll dry out nicely before filling it back up with a liquid similarly with the the top the drip tip should give that a nice wipe down and around the o-ring seal make sure that's sealed nicely and then you can use a cotton bud if it fits and just clean out the inside of the drip tip as well just to get rid of all all the flavor and all the residue that can build up because obviously over time the more that you use these things the more that the liquid kind of breaks down and can stick to your apparatus so that's it let's pretend that's dry inside so that's now ready to go another tip would be to make sure that the bottom doesn't have sometimes you can get a bit of e-liquid seeping into this area so again it's quite simple just give it a wipe round the dry or very slightly wet damp cotton bud get into all the nooks and crannies and give it a nice wipe here because at the end of the day this is where the electrical connection heats up the wicks inside off the battery so you need to make sure that's always nice and clean and similarly on the battery end of the connector you sometimes see a little bit of residue down in here see if I got a bit closer for you so again just clean that out with a cotton bud you should do this maybe every few days or at least once a week just to prolong the life and it genuinely will prolong the life of year your lluvia pad okay so screw it back together now you've got a nice clean atomizer ready for the same a liquid more e-liquid whatever you want but that will that be good to go so I would recommend that you dry it out because obviously the water will swipe you don't leave you a liquid but all in all that's you know it's good to go so let's have a look at a slightly different this one is an Apollo brand it screws off the same has a very similar battery again probably make sense just to give you a battery connector a quick clean but actually did have quite a bit of any liquid in there so that's nice and clean now inside there's that to one side and then we have this which is their atomizer which has a coil inside so this one does break down fairly well so first of all we will take the coil section off the bottom and I place that to one side for now now see if there's any extra a liquid few drops not much in there so nice smell this one this is watermelon so again take you your bottle with your warm water in and squirt it down the side like you would with a liquid then again finger over the end give it a shake pour away the residue and I would do this a number of times just to to get as much of that a liquid out as you can again don't fill it to the top leave some room so when you shake it has a room to maneuver around the getting the nooks and crannies there we go so that's pretty much running clean again so two squirts two shakes and it seems all good again and I can see through the the clear window on the side that that is really well it doesn't smell at all now again take a cotton bud and just clean out all or as much as you can of the actual drip tip and the same inside as well around here and then in this case I can't get my cotton got very far down inside so what I can do is I can just take of a bit of kitchen roll of a paper towel roll it out at the end that fits nicely down inside now turn that round inside and I'll get the rest of the liquid that the the cotton bud couldn't reach go that's gone all the way through so that is now perfectly clean as good as new so the coil and this is a bit more messy like I said this has a replaceable coils so this coil screws out like so out of the base place the coil on the paper towel for now and I'll just take the the end I'll just squirt some water over it there's no extra parts in there just to remove all the liquid there I'll take another paper towel and just give this a clean get all the extra water off the main thing to remember here is everything's cleanable with water you've just got to try and get all the water off again once you've finished the cleaning process so that's all good I think what I'll do is I'll take a cotton bud and just wait round inside with a dry cotton board just to get that residual water out here we go it's there that's a clean base and a clean top now the coil the coil itself as you can see if I get a bit closer there there's not a great deal you can do with this you don't really want to get water onto the wicks as such I'm going to try and avoid that so what you can do is you can just wipe it around on the end to get as much of that yield liquid off as possible and any residual stuff on the end get that off and the other end and if you've been really picky what you can do is you can roll some more kitchen roll up and you can go all the way through the section and down the down the center but I don't see too much use for that and at the end of the day these are replaceable coils but what it means is when you when you have a VM with repairs or Kyle's it does make it a little easier to to take because you can take it apart and makes a lot easier to clean so there we go so let's put this back together so the coil goes in this section and the whole thing goes together like so and pop the battery back on so there you have it we have two perfectly clean as good as new there and ready to go so I hope that's helped yeah you clean everything pretty much the same as what I've just done with these two examples or via pens working pretty much the same manner and yes the same goes even with so bomb setups with with saban tanks you break them down as much as possible clean as much as you can with warm water and for the same reasons it's just to prolong the life if you vaporizer you know so you don't have to to to spend as much on on replaceable x' as as you might do", "DMdIS3YSdwY": "hi my name is Peter I'm with transferring USA and today I am proud to present to you the transferring bait cartridge autofilter this machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering customization installation and ongoing maintenance for this machine also in the meantime be sure to subscribe to our channel as we post more videos about how to clean this machine calibrate it and customize it for your particular operation I want to thank you for watching and stay posted for more informative videos about the transferring vape cartridge autofilter machine", "Y9c1e221R0I": "[Music] hi guys welcome back today we are gonna discuss the 1937 brand cartridges these are a really good brand than I discovered a few months ago this is the second cartridge that I have bought the first one was a King Louie absolutely loved the flavor on it got every single last bit out of it there was no waste with this one it tasted so good this one that I recently purchased is the purple blue dream equally tasty equally tasty supposed to be a hybrid I kind of feel like it's more of a like an indica based hybrid I don't know if that's just me or if that's really the way it is but that's kind of I I like this for the afternoons for the evenings before bed anyways there the packaging is pretty interesting it's got a little bit of a mission statement on the inside a little bit of history the packaging is pretty cool I don't know you can't see much on the back because they put the THC info sticker on the back but it does give you the basic information it is manufactured by us CP which is also the manufacturer of the Oklahoma tonic which I absolutely adore this dust really good it's good for trying to relax it helps me relax it it actually affects you a little different than it edible does I don't know if it's because this is a liquid and the way your body processes that I don't know I just know it's good I have bought three of these now really good stuff but let's get back to the 1937 brand cartridges the cartridges are always completely full when I buy them there is no little gap like there is in some brands I've been smoking on this for a week and that is how much it's gone down I like the I'm sorry I like the packaging the mouthpiece is around only thing I don't like is there's never a mouthpiece guard I kind of want a garden like a little rubber thing that goes over the top of it but still a good a good a good design I guess this is magnetic this is the excess snap I really like it it fits in the palm of my hand it's kind of just straight if you ever you know just just discreet nobody can really see it except for maybe the mouthpiece and still yet it can be very discreet I love this thing because you can look in through there it protects I really like this because it protects but yet you can look through there and see exactly how much juice you know is left and there is nothing that makes me happier than looking in there and seeing it completely yellow I mean completely full one of the best feelings in the world so anyway skies it's about 4:20 in the afternoon so cheers cheers Cheers hmm he's taste really good they have a different taste to them something unique I'm not I'm not sure how to describe it other than it's a lovely flavor I have tried the helix brand I have tried the Arcadia brand and I have tried the Oklahoma pure brand so far 19:37 has them beat pretty good I mean the helix was good but they're not readily available in this area these are available they're affordable and I really like them the oil in them is clearly I mean it just it does not move and that's something I like I have seen them like the Arcadia brand and was I mean it was terrible it do this and it just instantly air bubbles and it was moving I don't like that I want it to be really thick it lets me know that it's not being cut of course you know the packaging kind of tells you a little bit about it it says the product is derived from THC distillate and cannabinoids or cannabis derived terpenes THC content is 85% terpene content is 5% it also says the product has been tested for can't a minute keep out of reach of children contains THC now say for kids or pet manufactured by us CP LLC and then on the back of course you've just got like I said the THC sticker that they put on everything here in Obama so yeah cheers guys so what's everybody doing for the 4th of July comment down below I love the fourth of July if you're still watching I would love I would love to see who's still watching at this point you okay guys I'm sorry that cut out earlier yeah I'm sitting out here in the garage I had to take a quick look at my plants and see how they were doing look excited every

anything that I need to do to fret here alright guys bye", "zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "WA2Z7UUezt4": "[Music] hi guys i'm dan hoff chief operating officer of honeystick and today we are bringing you guys the just batteries twist battery which is a project that honeystick did in collaboration with just cbd one of the leading producers of cbd and hemp products so i was speaking with just cbd management when we had this idea to go in on this endeavor and what we said is we wanted to create an awesome twist battery that works well with cbd carts and to make it really stylish offer some cool color options but what's the key thing is to make it really affordable so you can actually get this twist battery that's a high capacity high powered battery very good quality covered by both of our companies warranties on vapehoneystick.com and also just cbdstore.com and i'll drop those uh those two links into the description you can get them on there for the low price of 9.99 so below 10 bucks is going to get you a super high quality battery from reputable companies that have a warranty on them and this isn't your gas station convenience store battery this is still a good high performance battery now the main thing that i want to focus on because it is a very similar informant function to our honey stick twist battery that we offer so i'm just going to do a real brief run through of the features and the functionality and then the main thing that i want to focus on are the awesome colors and packaging that we put together and now this twist batteries will work great with your um pre-filled tanks 510 tanks that you get from the dispensaries from cbd stores all over anything that's a 510 slim tank is going to work well with this thing it's also going to work well with slim wax and dab applications things like our silencers and wax tanks and definitely be a very good reliable power plant for those so once we do just a real brief preview there of what options we have that you guys are watching now i'm gonna run through the form of functionality and the instructions for this just batteries battery so for the just batteries you're gonna see you have the button right here you're going to have the twister knob right there each one of these kits is going to come with a charger included so for 9.99 you are fully turnkey minus the cartridge that you would pick up at your dispensary or your online cbd store now before you get started you're going to want to make sure this battery is charged if a battery is completely drained it could take you about two hours to charge the battery all you do is take the charge that's provided you're going to screw it in and you are going to make sure to get this onto a charger now i always warn everybody when you're looking for a charger for this stick to desktop computers and non-apple wall adapters stay away from any apple adapters and also stay away from rapid chargers laptop computers or power banks because they won't properly charge a device or might not charge at all so that's a very common troubleshooting question that we get now the first thing that you're going to do is get this on the charger light over here when you plug it in is going to blink while it's charging then it's going to go solid which is the light that's around the led it's going to go solid now to turn the battery on once it's charged so i'd show you the example the led you'll click it five times repeatedly rapidly one two three four five and as you see it blinks up and as you see it is green when i push it now what does that green mean this battery is sophisticated enough to where it has power level indication so when you push on your vaping and the light around there's green that means that you're running basically a full charge once you get down to about a half charge that green is going to turn from green to an amber that's going to mean you're running half a charge or below you probably want to start thinking about charging your battery pretty soon then when your battery is close to being you know needing a charge or dead for that for that word um you are gonna it's gonna turn red now once it turns red that means get this thing on a charger you got a couple hits left so that has a good power indication level so you know when this thing's going to need a charge you're not going to get hit with just a multiple blink no you know surprise power adjustment if we zoom in real close you see you have a little twister knob now you have a little twister knob and you also have numbers going around the battery now this goes all the way up to four volts as you can see there's a little uh divot there in the twister now whatever that little divot thing there number that lines up with means that's the power setting that you're on and you can do that for example right now i'm going to just move it on over to 3.5 so you can see and you can scroll it all the way down to the minimum which is 2 volts now we made the minimum 2 volts it's because we've been getting a lot of demand from people who are now into this low voltage vaping and these ultra low resistance carts that need very very low inputs to vape properly to give you good flavor and activation maintain terpenes and cbd profiles so we want to make sure you have a very nice low starting point from 2 volts but you can bang with the best of them at 4 volts okay which means you can bang out some serious power out of out of these carts to give you guys some monster rips out of standard five-time carts now this battery does have preheat functionality which means especially for cold weather climates you uh you might have a cartridge that's a little seized up needs a little low voltage a little warm up to get it going when the battery is on what you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead and push this button two times quickly and fast i'll do it right now and what you'll see is you'll see the color light up blue rainbow it's changing colors that means it's preheating at any given point during that time you can push the button one time you're exiting preheat mode once your cartridge is preheated this is mainly for colder climates or cartridges that have gunked up or things like that so since we've gone through this battery the form and the functions let's run through and show you guys a 360 of each one of the colors just so you see what you would be purchasing and what your options are with this amazing battery let's start off all the way over here and check out our slate gray now the slate gray is a matte color very deep gray if you don't look closer it's not under the right light you might even think that it's black i mean this is what this is the same paint that they're putting on those beautiful expensive mercedes and bentleys those amgs those g wagons they are beautiful matte colored slate paint i think this is very stylish battery very clean if you want something more plain we can transition over to the black battery you're gonna have to edit that out how long does that go for you go over to the black battery let's do a nice little 360 of that now this is a matte black it's pretty flat but it does have a really nice pop to it you see of the just batteries insignia there the next color that we have is a matte gold so it's not a sparkly gold it's matte but it has this nice champagne deep champagne finish to it definitely a very nice unique option there on a color then we have a shiny rose gold right here i want to make sure we get it in the right light so you see that it's not like a stainless because it's like a kind of like a copper like if you had an ultra polished you know penny probably want to dim the lights to show so there that is your rose gold and again you guys will have some really nice detailed pictures on both the the just cbd store and the vape honey stick website then you have a matte silver again it's not a metallic or polished it's a nice matte silver no real sparkles but a real nice uh finish on the paint there and then for those who want more of a shiny silver we have the full stainless which is a brushed stainless steel finish nice and reflective the way that they're coated they're not really going to fingerprint up and get dirty so this is really nice clean cut for that metallic look and then we go over to a blue this is a nice aqua that's very similar to our our honey stick blue that's a very popular color that we wanted to uh to emulate here because we have a lot of fans of this blue color and then lastly we have a nice red we wanted to make it shiny to look like your favorite red sports car or fire engine style this is a really nice deep clean red let's do a nice little 360 here you see that just battery insignia the twister so as you guys can see for ten dollar for under ten dollars on these batteries you cannot go wrong at that price with getting a high quality battery that that has really nice finishes and looks for them that'll power up your 510 thread carts you have endless options on the colors here very

lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate", "_dwDGj43WRM": "hey everybody it's Jay again with a brand new video on how to fix a broken vape pen cartridge this is an extension of my previous video which I'll put the link right there for you that I made last year on how to do this exact same thing but in that amount of time I have learned a couple of new things which is going to be number four and number five and in this video I'm gonna go through everything that I explained in the last video but I'm going to do a little faster so hopefully that'll make some of you happy that don't like sitting through very long videos but it is important that I cover all these details so that we know what is going on so without further ado if you like these videos please consider subscribing I'm a stay-at-home dad and if you in these videos helped you out please consider donating to my venmo @j Andres or to my cash app j1 two to zero so without further ado let's start off with number one is the air flow disrupted let's check all four areas so number one is the mouthpiece right so our cartridge our mouthpiece on these particular cartridges these are the kingpin brand the mouthpiece actually comes unscrewed so if we do unscrew the mouthpiece we can see real easily it's not clogged so there's no reason to go any further with that one if you had a severe oil leakage your oil might be clogged up inside of there and then in that case just use a pipe cleaner to get that out of there or a little rolled-up piece of paper towel or something one thing I notice is I just knocked off this little rubber washer so I'm just gonna put that back into place there you go nice and sticky there's also a rubber washer right in there to go up flush against that glass to keep that that oil from leaking out so let's put that back together so area number one is the mouthpiece we just check that it's good area number two is the bottom air hole so the bottom air holes right there is it clogged obviously if it's not obviously clogged then we're just gonna skip that what we don't want to do before I go any further I know we have some different tools up here I got my little paperclip and I got pipe cleaner and all that what we don't want to do is please do not stick anything through the entirety of your cartridge because we have these little wicks that are inside of these two little holes right there and right there which are the same as these two little holes right there and there this cartridge the glass does not screw off I had to break it off for the demo purposes of this display here okay so is your mouthpiece clogged is the bottom air hole clogged number three of this section is the side holes near the bottom of the threading this is the bottom threading there are air holes right there so when we screw on our cartridge to our battery those air holes receive air from the fourth section the air flow slots at the top of the pen which are right there they look like little castle teeth air will flow in through here and then it will enter the side holes near the top of the threading and then also - it will enter through the bottom this is the contact pin that makes contact with this little plate of your battery that sends electricity to this and then this transfers electricity to your wick coils there are two four one two three four this coil is missing the wick because I took it out the wick absorbs the oil from your middle cylinder so all of your oil will be in here and then the oil will go into those holes right there into the wick the wick receives electricity and heat from the coils and it turns your liquid into vapor which you then inhale so hopefully that is a quick understanding of how that works where are those coils you might ask those coils are inside of the rubber gasket so the anatomy here is this center contact pin slides into this rubber gasket and then inside of the rubber gasket there should be two little fine wires which wrap around a wick on the outside of this rubber gasket there will be another set of two so there's two outside the rubber washer there's two wires inside the rubber washer what I believe is happening to a lot of people is that when you purchase these the cartridges unfortunately I think when the robots are putting these together at the factory the robots are putting the center contact pin back in for the final step of assembly and when they put this pin back in what I very firmly believe is this pen when they push it in there it is displacing the coil wires so that's point number two is the enter wick coil displaced and then not touching the contact pin that is the contact then this is the coil wire the coil wire wraps around a wick there should be two wicks which you won't see he should never see because if you see those then they're out of place those wicks again go through these holes they're right in the middle of these holes and this goes straight through you see that and there are two holes one two there should be two wicks inside of there nothing else if those wicks get displaced then you have problem number three so going back to problem number two is the center wick coil displaced and not touching the contact and what you would have to do is you would have to take your contact pin out like I did with my fingernails and then you would check no I don't know if you could see right there there are two little wires let me see if I could bring this closer in focus there are two little wires in there if you don't see your two wires and you only see one that means that one of them got pushed up out of place and now you only have one or maybe you like this better got pushed up out of place and there's only one wire because of the robots the evil robots now if they got displaced you can use a special tool which is use a special tool to recenter one or both of the coil wires what we don't want to do is when we're fishing in there for that wire we don't want to pull it completely out because it is not infinite length it is only this long and that long if you pull that out you're gonna pull the wick with it and then all of your fluid is going to go where into the middle air cylinder and you're gonna get a hard gurgling and you're gonna start losing a bunch of your fluid and there's no recovering that right so this is a tool from a sewing kit if you say we're threading a needle and you put this through the needle you could put your string in through that hole and then you would pull this through and it pulls the thread through the needle that's what this is from a sewing kit also - from my soldering kit I got these very very fine tweezers which are definitely going to be able to get that coil if you can get your tweezers onto them right if your coils are out of place then you're probably going to get a blinking error code when you go to hit this thing when you go to light it instead of it just lighting nice and smooth it might blink three or four times a weird color different colors and that is an error code letting you know that there's something wrong from the inner workings of your cartridge the electricity is not flowing properly do not pull the wires completely out or your oil will leak you might be missing a wire due to a manufacturer defect and if that's the case maybe go back to your local store and then say hey I think that there's a problem here I'm missing my center coil my manye for my bat my cartridge isn't working so hopefully if you live in a legal state you can go back to your store and you can get that replaced otherwise you might be out of luck and if you are out of luck in that instance then you might have to transfer your oil to a working cartridge like an empty one and empty working or non leaking cartridge so I always suggest keep these around when you're done with them when they're empty because if it was where if you had one that was working and you have say a brand new one that isn't working you could transfer the oil from this one to this one by simply unscrewing the cap and then you can actually stack these on top of each other if you have a steady hand and my previous video I did that so you could check that out you could put this part on top of the similar part and they will stack and all the oils transfer down the middle and go into the cylinder of your working cartridge so let's put that back on there before any more oil leaks out so that was number two is the center with coil displaced number three are your wicks out of place and now your oils leaking so you might say well what's the wick again that is the wick right there there should be two of them a wick that is wrapped with a coil and there would be another wick inside of this coil and those are inside of there those wires travel down the bottom of this cartridge and make contact with the center cylinder and with the bottom contact pin which will make contact with your battery contact plate all right so if your Center wick is out of place you're gonna know because you're not going to be able to draw a clean fresh smooth vapor out of your cartridge it's gonna seem to be stuck and you the tell-tale sign the very real sign is you're gonna hear a gurgling a slurping gurgling and that means that inside of the middle cylinder instead of this air and vapor going through you have oil leaking into these holes because your wicks are not in the hole they've been displaced so if they've been displaced oil is gonna go in the hole and you're gonna get a gurgling so if that happens that's number three while your wicks out of place transfer your oil your liquid to a working cartridge you can go to your local smoke shop and get a little ceramic tip we can get one of these not brand specific but you can get a generic one you can transfer your oil there it might take you some time but it might be your only option if you live in a non legal state number four these are the new additions did you try and screen your pen to increase the air flow well what what happens is over time the for air flow areas become clogged and it will disrupt your air flow so all we're gonna do is instead of screwing it on all the way nice and tight I found that sometimes all you got to do is just unscrew it a little bit and that will help increase the air flow into the side holes near the bottom of threading or it may increase the possibility of the airflow is going to go through the bottom air hole right there well minus the pen or a minus the contact pen so try unscrewing and to increase your air flow number five is your cartridge just getting old and clogged this is vapor it's sticky liquid and as you continue to use your product to the point of completion residue is just going to build up in there we all know that from smoking our tobacco pipes screens need to be replaced different cleaning solutions need to be used whatever we need to do to make sure that we can get air flow and these aren't any difference so as your a cartridge getting old and clogs so what I do is I actually inhale some fire lightly through the tip and blow out the melted wax so what do I mean by that is in my with my tip here I will just inhale put my mouth on the mouthpiece there and I will very lightly very lightly just a little mouth drag like you're hitting a cigar like a little give a little kiss and get kissed that the sticky oil in there with some fire and then blow it out below that sticky oil out right let me see if I could demonstrate this so not so much came out but maybe I could do it with already took these off anyway it works just try it out if you're not hearing if you just try it if you have this off and you try to take a mouth drag off it and you don't hear clean air going through it's clogged in there and that is very easily going to be your problem if it's if it's just getting old and clogged it might be new and clogged we don't know but just inhale a little bit of fire through that tip and then below that sticky wax out it will be hard sticky wax also turn to melted sticky wax and then you can blow it out let's see also - we can use the lighter to gently melt the thread wax on the cartridge so this is the thread the threading here that might get some sticky residue so we could just melt that and then just wipe it off and you'll get something same thing - with the inside of your pen just give a little just a little quick melt and then get inside of there and clean it out there's gonna be something and that something the threading if that threading gets all gunked up here and here then you're not going to get any airflow through the bottom hole which I should probably put that back so again one if we since I'm doing this let's talk real quick about is the center quit the Senator wick quill displaced when the robots are putting these back together when they push these in there I believe that this contact pin is pushing the wire is out of place and/or just snapping them on like snapping a heart sorry about the focusing on this camera let me see if I can fix it tada all right so when this is getting pushed in at the factory I think it's snapping these off or just moving them out of place so hopefully this video helps you out I've been I've been noticing when I've been using mine as they get older simply unscrewing them a little bit helps out a lot so just unscrew it a little bit and that should increase crease your air flow and then also to use the lighter trick to get them from being clogged all right so that's that hopefully this video helped you if the previous one didn't again sorry about the focusing issues I was unaware of whatever focusing issues were happening again if you like this video just subscribe they'll help me to get paid so you don't have to donate to me but if you do want to donate that would be super dope because you know I'm a stay-at-home dad so thanks again my name is Jay have an awesome rest of your day", "C6-FVBebXdo": "guys my name is Joey I'm here at discount vape pen and today we gonna be talking about the new cloak [Music] alright guys so like I told you earlier in the video there's a new cloak by Hamilton devices is gonna be a new discreet cartridge battery device I mean the screen I mean very very discreet so inside the package you're gonna have your little note right here it's gonna tell you a little bit about the extractions and how to use this device but after this video you should definitely have a good understanding so we have a small little device that looks like a pod vape and it's basically just posed to act like a pod fate and it'll show you that in a second so right there you don't have a USB port you have your little uh helmets in the device shark right there this is a little design logo top of is gonna be the mouthpiece and then that's it now you're asking yourself how you gonna put the cartridge in easy you gonna slide this right over so it's a two-piece alright guys so like I said this is a two-piece device so there's gonna be the mouthpiece and a little place where the Karcher is gonna go in there's the magnet that holds the top and then right here you don't see this is where the connection is that's your 510 it is the auto auto draw the device because there's no burning so you want to take this cartridge there's gonna screw it right on it's a lot of threads guys now once is on all you got to do is take another piece right there slide it down push and we're done so right here you won't have two different size cartridge you have the point 5 mil in the hole 1 mil this does the fit both size and it fits a magnitude of different size cartridges as well so just like I showed you earlier you won't screw it on stays in place pop the cover over and we're done so this device is a 500 milliamp battery so it does have enough power that'll last you all day without having any issues or run into a charger and the way it works is there's no just ability to it it just goes by the battery power so it's fully charged he's gonna hit at 4.2 volts once the decrease in charge it lowers the power of voltage so like I said guys fully charged which this it does gonna hit at 4.2 volts so all you got to do is press your lips against that little mouthpiece inhale and they'll activate and I'll show you that right there and it hits pretty freakin hard at 4.2 volts definitely recommend this oh guys like I said earlier this device is pretty awesome small and discreet and I've been reading the comments it was cvd car just calm down guys so uh you know where to pick this up right discount Bay pen comm same day free shipping it's gonna be $29.99 pick it up while supplies last [Music] [Applause] you", "ldodqwERjx0": "[Music] hello everybody welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary today we are going to be reviewing a cart from a company that i've seen around for some time i've seen them selling their flour at a lot of uh shops here in southern california especially the long beach area for it seems like a couple of years uh and now it looks like like a lot of folks they are branching out getting into other kinds of products um i know uh that this these people are now doing cartridges they're doing uh different concentrates and they are also doing tinctures of uh different varieties uh and what is that company that company is cresco cresco and this is their indica cartridge just uh nominally called rest it is their half uh gram cartridge 500 milligrams um and i picked this up for i actually couldn't tell you what the real cost was i it was uh some combination of purchasing this and one of their tinctures some kind of uh discount but i think they're a more affordable brand i think this is probably in the realm of like 20 to 25 for a half gram cart not too bad um in terms of packaging um it is uh refreshingly minimalistic not a lot of uh you know extra materials here just simple cardboard but all the information you want to see uh so the it is also in addition to being their rest line uh it is the critical purple push strain uh excuse me critical purple kush rather we all knew that and then you've got lab testing results there on the side a little sticker and then on the bottom you do have the um thc results and that comes in at 76.5 percent uh for 382 and a half percent or 382 milligrams of thc if that'll focus so uh this is pretty standard 510 fare here um uh no special pod or different kind of battery involved just your standard good old-fashioned 510 vape thread battery which you know feels to me like is uh becoming more and more of a uh a rarity to find uh the universal beloved 510 thread okay so we've ripped some tape off here at the bottom now we've got some push to do pushing pulling and there we go ah yes and this is a liquid live resin the uh still uh lost a little bit of its luster the term live resin not as much of a buzzword as it once was but still a lot of uh live resin devotees and this is apparently live resin uh and so here we are here is our cartridge design um got the plastic acrylic tip which is not my favorite uh but otherwise pretty standard looking 510 thread doesn't look like the nicest materials in the world but i don't think it's the most expensive cart either so let's go ahead and use my trusty 510 here as you know if you've watched me do some of these before i used to try to use nice 510 batteries uh to do these reviews with uh but for a variety of reasons i no longer do one because even the nice 510 batteries suck and they break down and then two i realized most people don't actually who are using these cartridges don't use a nice fancy online purchase battery they use the one that came free in the store the one that costs 10 bucks at the convenience shop or whatever they're not you know out there looking for the best so this is more uh in line with what a lot of people are experiencing uh not that this one's terrible just a standard 510 uh this one is raw garden branded i think it cost me like 12 bucks some number of months ago so uh without further ado let's go ahead and shut up and try this cresco uh critical purple kush half gram cart yummers wow yeah that is pretty good that is a pleasant surprise that that both hit harder than i thought um also came out more than that's a pretty nice hit for a um 510 thread and it was uh quite tasty it didn't taste like any added terpenes um tasted like your good old-fashioned full spectrum there wow yeah this is an unexpected trait this is pretty good stuff um i was not expecting to be as enamored with this as i am um super tasty it's very strong um this is a pretty remarkable amount of draw or um pardon the term cloud for such a small hit watch this not bad at all not bad um feels every bit of that advertise what was it 76 76 and a half percent for sure um and then again very very um nice flavor super smooth um and if you like your cartridges to have a very authentic non-added artificially terpene taste this is gonna do it for you wow this is uh a a nice little surprise i'm i'm quite enjoying this cresco liquid live resin uh and even the cartridge itself is is surprising me in terms of the kind of draws i'm getting here so let's get one board yum well this uh first half of this review is extremely positive but you know you're gonna have to stay tuned for the whole thing because here at wheats we don't just review the first half of our cartridges we do the whole gall darn thing um we do it from top to bottom so that i can come back to you guys give our whole thoughts let you know that the whole thing went through smoothly it never started to burn uh the wick didn't go out the uh didn't start to get clogged all those things that can go wrong with these uh 510 threads make sure we'll give it the whole wheat's review really really looking forward to uh doing so and uh i'm looking forward to come back in here coming right back here to report those results so i will see you guys right back here keep sitting right back here uh in probably a couple of days or so until then take care stay healthy and stay high my friends welcome back guys it has been about 60 hours two and a half days uh since i had started our journey with the cresco rest purple critical purple punch live resin cart uh and i still really enjoyed it uh this is a very good little cart um that oil is uh very quality stuff uh it tastes great um never got this super super hot burnt taste there at the end that you sometimes get you would get those sort of um uh they would burn a little bit hotter at the end but not nothing too much to worry about uh the one thing that i would say to be cautious of uh and i haven't had to say this in a while um is the thing that i brought up in the first half is uh there you're gonna get some unexpectedly big draws off of this uh i was very surprised uh more than once uh sort of devolved into a coughing fit because i took bigger draws than i um intended to i don't actually mean that as uh um a slight against it i i wish actually more carts uh had uh the ability you know you didn't have to uh draw as much on them to get such big hits but this one uh definitely does not have that problem so uh be careful if you're accustomed to other ones this one can give you a huge powerful hit without much effort uh it's not the oil is that much more powerful it's you know good oil but nothing crazy it's just that whatever this card design is airflow or whatever heating element uh causes much larger actual intake than normal uh but i did not think of that as a bad thing i just screwed up my implementation every now and then um so on the whole really really enjoyed this cresco rest critical purple push punch excuse me i assume they probably just have uh hybrid indica and sativa with the generic name but they have different strains it's like this is called the rest but it is also critical purple kush don't quite get that um but what i would get is this cartridge if i saw it again for an affordable price uh i'd love to try their one grams if they have them i'm not sure if they do or not but this half gram was a big thumbs up for me uh again that is the cresco liquid live resin indica rest cartridge pretty good stuff especially if you're a live resin fan well guys that's going to do it for this review here on wheats thanks for staying tuned here till the very end it's been a blast hanging out with you and until our next review guys be sure to stay high and even more importantly stay healthy and we'll see you back here for the next video goodbye", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be truly grateful and i got some really cool stuff just dropped the free smoke edition the stone bald eagle i got a whole video coming about that because it represents a lot to me i put a lot of thought in it and i want to thank the artists on that video too so keep an eye out grab some true buds merch if you're feeling this video show some love to me i'll keep making videos showing love to you you know what i'm saying thank you and i'll catch you on the next video here on true buds tv yeah this is true buzz that mary j now we ain't new to this for my stoners and for my cannabis enthusiasts talking edibles ain't bringing comedy let's get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session yeah true love for my true buzz light it up and i'm on it this vibe take me way back screaming i got five on it in the cut of sativa anything that you need break it down like the weed this is true buzz tv buzz i'm a stoner i'm a smoker it's a hobby it's a lifestyle and a culture yeah this is yeah this is", "fSNDZ9HQnQk": "[Music] all right guys what's up simplistic here back with another video i'd like to mention that randy is filming this whole entire video on his camera so the video quality is going to be a lot better but if you didn't see from the b-roll all that good stuff i do have three buddies i mean you've already seen it but uh basically i bought a distillate one and a live resin one but the distillate has live resin terps and uh it is a form of live resin to me so for those of you who say it's not realized to me it is all right but uh one of these are actually ben's and we're gonna give him right here thank you but he's also gonna be in the video shout out to be legit also subscribe to rj eats and i'm saying the link will be in the bottom description below all that good stuff but for this video we have two batteries we have a stick battery from the chill and we have your typical box battery uh from the brand das vape so we're definitely gonna try both of these these are both sativas as well one's clementine one is train wreck and uh for those of you who want to see the differences this one the green one is actual live resin this one's distilled with live resin terps and as you can see this one has ten percent more terps or ten percent terps while this one only has uh four but what this lacks inter uh percentage they actually have a lot more not a lot more but more thc see as you can see right here total cannabinoids like 80 something this one's like 70. that's the difference between distillate and live resin live resins generally 70s maybe 80s if you're lucky with distillate being 80 to 90. so um i'm going to open these and uh i'm just going to take some hits i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe buddies live resin and distill it live resin terps i don't know what i would call it but something along those lines and uh just let me know in the comments how you liking this video quality you know what i'm saying i appreciate mandy for uh filming this whole episode with this stuff i don't say but right off the bat opening this smells very lemony i believe the prominent oh wait i thought it was there right so put that in you can see the color of this the color of this distillate with the live resin terps is generally going to be a lighter more green or yellowish color i mean it even says in the box right look at the colors compared to them the live resin right here is uh generally going to be darker but distill it with live resin terps gonna be a a yellowish greenish color yeah got it got it so yeah did you take the first hit well this is an action i don't know autofocus is pretty [ __ ] fire okay yeah standing still is a little harder but moving around like it's i'm wondering that's how it's gonna work with the app too because the aperture you can lower the aperture a lot further down on that on the 22 millimeter that i have yeah so this one's the captain kush this was what ben chose as you can see let's just mix them up and [ __ ] damn that's fine let me see oh [ __ ] yeah very good that one's a live resin on the right no these are both the distally with the live resin terms [Applause] but you'll see the difference sorry about that broke this box this is the [ __ ] that [ __ ] all right right here get that see you can see the colors oh yeah yeah the one in the middle yeah this one has 10 turfs these ones have four percent but these have a higher percentage in thc or cannabinoids so uh this one's yours before i forget and we're gonna just take it take a hit off all three i'm saying who's calling me cheers [Music] hello no gotta give one to the camera man um yeah i got it um it's auto focus yeah i'll do it for you oh [ __ ] that's dope go no wonder you're far back yeah i was like what the heck that bigger crop it's it's uh uh just randy oh my god it looks dope uh yeah damn you can feel this glance working when the it's shaking so we have to switch the spot real quick guys because the kitchen is being occupied but randy just took a hit off the train wreck cartridge how'd you like it it definitely hit right definitely hit yeah honestly you're paying 28 for a gram of this right yeah that's why i bought two more i mean uh this is like my third one that i bought of the white one because some i don't know why i i seem to like the distillate live resin turps better than the live resin one and i don't know if it's just me it's a lot cheaper too maybe that's uh it tastes good to me i don't know but ben hasn't taken a hit off this this is the clementine i mean trainer okay what's up alexis oh i still got a pretty good angle of it because i got in there in time i was still uh like last time i thought it would turn out i was like so no we got the live resin one of the clementine so if you're not awake all right so i'm gonna take a hit of this off this battery you guys know this battery hits okay oh this is a good shot holy [ __ ] this one's a lot smoother the the library is a lot smoother this one uh i feel like it hits a lot harder maybe that's what adds on to the harshness to it you get a fatter hit off the distillate one because maybe distillate is a thinner oil even though it's still thick it's a lot thinner i gotta get out the shot that was kind of weird there you go i love the cart whose was this one this is the the clementine with 10 turks one was wet last one was i need to try it again this one's good though i don't know i like the this this one tastes good though yeah it tastes more like natural yeah okay and then we're going to try tastes like actual dab now so since this is his he's going to try it first and it's going to be a winker cbs can you bring his calling no yeah [Laughter] this is actually ben's so when we went to authentic today i i came with the idea of buying a liquid live resin or a live resin one and a distance live resin turf one and then ben also came along and purchased one as well because he tries he tried my buddy's car before and he liked it you know and it's 28 you really can't beat that but yeah i'm gonna try this now um the total for all three of these was only 86.50 that's pretty good that's hella good usually that's like almost grabbing a half maybe that ground and 20 quarters i mean a quarter that 20 that 20 quarters [Music] and you can see his pores and [ __ ] oh [ __ ] dog though all right so [Music] so oh this one's a lip do you change the brightness yeah did you die it still look nice change it oh go hold on we got to fix that though no it's cool it's cool looks good it's not too bright no it's better now but the other one wasn't wasn't that bad it was still bright but you guys hear that joe rogan in the background you feed me that's the biggest [Music] all right so um uh all three you guys like the live rest one better uh probably the what was the first one that was the train wreck i like that one better yeah but the close that the second one is going to be the live resin one that's my birthday um but to end off the video guys i am going to take a hit off both at the same time and uh i don't know i'm going to title this video maybe somewhere along the lines blinking both buddies parts i don't know something like that um but yeah look at both legs clicking both buttons so cheers [Laughter] [Music] that's for you guys we're gonna end it off with uh randy taking a hit i'd like to thank you guys for uh watching the video and also randy for being a part of it and using his camera always also be legit for taking those blinkers even though he didn't want to and uh you know what i'm saying i can obviously i can really tell the difference between my camera and uh randy's camera with the the landsat oh [ __ ] you don't have to hold it in bro [Music] all right guys so as you can see it's about done so cameraman has been switched but we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video just another buddies cartridge video i've been buying them a lot lately because i really [ __ ] with that they're really affordable and high quality at the same time you know i'm saying i don't care for these 80 gram cartridges or fifty dollar half gram cartridges and i could care less for that but yeah other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video like it subscribe all that good stuff and see you guys [Music] you", "qzeEWxC1UQc": "smoking man growin and watch it fall down [Music] what is up DTC's got it real hanging out super psyched to have a new friend Julian from Bab logic over hey thank you for having me really yes yes hey I appreciate you guys blew it up at the deconcentration celebration yeah yeah yeah no it was a fun time yeah you took home you took home I think was third place in there boys what was this again you brought some with you yeah we can each owns the HT batter it's like really high terpene high potency yeah this is oops this is one to remember right here you brought two of them I like yeah I brought a couple kami I brought a truck Korean or trap cookies and so what's your specialty if you guys were dab logic what are y'all known for um we create high quality you know highly purified high terpene solving with hash oils solvent less overall solvent list so we specialize in ninety micronized soil we also specialize in the different types of bras in all the way from our newest product which is like the HT batter's all the way through like the HT show weight HT what's that mean hide your bathing yeah basically anything you know reaching on the 15% you know mark we consider pretty high tech 15 yeah 15% terpenes just pretty freakin high yeah especially for solving lists you know most concentrates are around six to eight percent on the standard market really a lot even less than that most most standard solvent less concentrates that you'll find on the market are probably about four to five even all right so help me out there help me evaluate concentrates what makes a good concert we're going to the dispensary together what we looking for yeah so when I go in and I look for a good concentrate first thing I do is you know you don't get to smoke the product in the dispensaries know you got to evaluate yeah you have to evaluate it either you know through your nose through sight you know right and then through prior you know prior time smoking either something that like that or but they could think about the colors beautiful on that yeah color colors is that you know is that to live or die by totally a giveaway you know I mean if you're looking at something and it's green or it has like you know a really dark amber to it you know it might be dagger dated it might have had heat stress you know something like that or it could be just the nature of the plant you know something like the truck the truck cookies that's always gonna have at least on the phenotype that's being passed around right a lot of the hash and being created from it right now yes it has that orange you know you cue to it yeah it's almost purple in the hue you know and when you press that and refine it it becomes like this orange almost amber like but that's beautiful orange I got a glowing orange I got no problem yeah yes smoked something that's glowing or it's the earth tones that I have a problem with yeah what does it are that's a sign that chlorophyll it's Asano's beat up too much yeah so when a plants cut if it's cut fresh you know a lot of these plans a lot of people are making fresh frozen and for plants cuts cut fresh it's gonna release Greenleaf volatiles which are different esters Josh aldehydes and you know alcohols that are released by the plant those end up actually soluble eyes in chlorophyll chlorophyll has a few different colors chlorophyll can be anywhere from purple all the way to you know the green that we know about well like purple is that like when plants purple up at the end is that chlorophyll that's so yes there's something to do with the chlorophyll and in the biosynthetic pathway that it actually takes right it's either heated or as it's you know matures or ages but a lot of times that's antioxidants is well produced by the plant such as anthocyanin or something similar to that those antioxidants even have somewhat of a smell to them even they're found in a lot of berries they're found in God and things like that so that's you kind of you know start to realize okay the purple plans have this berry-like or grape-like kind of smell to it it's kind of through that anti oxidant pathway and the enzymes that produce those right so and that's all based on the genetic makeup of the plant I have a very natural next question how the hell did you learn all this stuff man you go to school for this are you just a Googler so there's not much information out there there's a lot of there's a lot of people who are pursuing to find the actual chemistry the actual science behind a lot of this stuff right some of that has been published what has been published you know you can find Ethan Rousseau dr. moosh dr. Musallam alright people like that okay they are pioneering a lot of this stuff and you're just reading their white papers and you read then read their work and then we also you know we work with scientists on our team as well we have a scientist from the University of Boulder who worked in the Caine lab and we're so he's an extra he's a expert in genomics so okay bioinformatics and things like that Wow it's so crazy that in the cannabis company have to have a genomics expert yeah you learn how to hire them I mean yeah it's starting to evolve to the point where now if we want to really you know pursue this we have to understand it more solving this hash is something that's kind of coming back from where it was you know in the past that's all there was there were thousands of years ago if you were to look at you know what cannabis crasher from you know it was charas and you know things on the hands it was the right amount of heat and pressure under pressure that you're able to even remove it from your hand or even able to change the right the chemistry of it because they didn't start smoking it you know it hated to be decarboxylated in order for that to happen it had to be left out in the Sun for a certain amount of time or it had to be heated to a specific temperature for a certain amount of time right you know and through this alchemy that you know has evolved I mean they found plants that were more beneficial for those processes you know that's why what we know of today as the hash varieties come from a very small group of plants because those came out of you know Afghanistan and Grammy Hall and you know places like that that we're actually using hash as a resource for a long time yeah makes sense that's pretty cool I'm just trying to think like everybody's got a different art you know growing can be an art shift photography can be an art what's your what you ought man yeah the art so the art really is involved with just uncovering mechana bees resin you know there's so much there that we don't really know about there's so your the extract artists I don't even know what's your title at that company I don't have one I founded dialogic founder - ice that's a great title because you're gonna have to do anything after what you already did your work no I still I still work with hash you know every day I'm still with the plants and every charge in my fingernail exactly no you just don't think yeah but uh yeah I'm still with the resin every day you know I who I started creating who I created that logic with right was some close friends that also still to this day are are doing different uh different extracts and working with the resin so it's a big industry man yeah so I wait how many people is we just laughing but you came to my studio and saw my work yeah about five guys yeah they all stopped and took a break to take it does take a couple dabs from you totally yeah yeah what's your work scene like what's it like to work at dab logic how many people to start with so I have five people on the the actual extraction team my California team is now expanding I have one guy out there right now but we're in the process of getting expanding that team our lab is just getting the CEO so we're just getting we're just able to move in your building out we had to you know gut the whole place and redo it all for insulation and you guys to talk of something logical you know the whole nine moved in a huge walk-in freezers you know cuz we have to we're taking a lot off you know off these mountains and in Humboldt so yeah can we talk about that for a second just said I was asking about your like I was in Cali for the I don't know can I call it Cali I heard that don't live in California called Cali yeah I mean it's humble it's where it's at right here you know Northern California yeah so you were there we're supposed to hang out last week and you're like dude its I'm out here still harvesting yeah and then I'm like alright so you tell me about what you got a 120,000 square foot indoor there is that right so no no no not that quite that big we got 20,000 square feet makes you like a computer we have hundred acres up off the grid and other 600 acres that's being built built out still isn't fully that 600 acres and fully permitted or license yet I'm not pulling anything off it yet but that's a beautiful property that property goes from the top of a mountain all the way down to the valley there's a river there should be good water oh and I make important water as important mazing water there's huge ponds and the property and streams and so that and that's your your founder that's your baby right there so that I'm partnered with the company Verde Verde natural they're out of they were started here in Denver by guy Chuck and he eventually partnered with who now is the main owner of the company Jeff he has expanded this company you know dramatically he's who took on dialogic and we got and flew it up and I mean you gotta have balls or night ball if you have to know what you're doing to first off do a hundred acres some people have success enough with your 100 acres to do 600 acres yeah yeah service schedule for that has to be amazing totally and I mean you know we don't grow on the whole hundred you know there's a lot that goes into actually running these this big of a farms and you're talking you know huge you know ponds and huge almost irrigation lines that are actually sure culvert it into the into the ground I run a 20 acre bamboo farm yeah yeah purty I was like yeah I was like yeah you need water you need a well you need huge yeah you need a water cleaning system yeah yeah yeah and we're trying to you know be all organic and you know the whole soil all that come on let's get into the growth first off how the hell do you do living I okay I got it you find a place with good soil if you're gonna do living soil on 100 or 600 acres I mean we bring in we do a mixture of local humble Mendocino County dirt and then we bring in some Canadian soil as well yeah yeah that just sound great water that stuff's yeah it's amazing that already is microbial active when it when it gets there you know it already has a nice you know uh humic body to share sure it's not ain't nothing sterile yeah yeah you know if it's and I think they do inoculate that would mycorrhizae don't they I know that they pull out of that out of some plots that they have along the old-growth and that God is definitely as major fungal and bacterial actually seen a peat mine or a peat bog I don't even mind yeah back near uh an old growers to have I Drive by it and it was like whoa what is that thing it's just cutting into the earth yeah I know yeah the pits interesting there that's a finite resource in there you know yeah it is yeah yeah I will say Florida peat not as good as a reason they imported from Canada so that's actually really cool that's alright so as long as we're talking grow how do you give quality and quality outs yeah how do you have first off indoor grows got to be tremendously different than an outdoor grow right yeah completely different different processing then on your end here that your the extract you noticed I mean definitely I was talking to somebody I was talking to it was loving in her eyes yesterday and she was talking about how to be I was asking her how to be a you know a really top quality extract artist she goes get to know your resin I think it was friend she can always that originally said it her for get to know your resin you know everything's different you know your room and your resin is gonna be different absolutely yeah when you move from grow to grow or you're starting a new grow and it's new growers its new people it's a new soil mix it's a new everything sure you know it is scary you know you're coming in with varieties you know it's not like we can really transfer varieties from state to state ads so it's like we're having to find and source varieties in California wait really that we haven't ran yet but I mean you can't or you can't uh so I mean a wedding cake can find its way over an account we have wedding cake we have like all you know I know you would never talk about other people no there is there is ways to definitely get them over they audit and through in through tissue culture and things like that we can actually legally do this stuff if we're sending over callous and undifferentiated cells we can actually send that across state lines and technically it's a gray area sure it's not a cannabis plant so they can't call you out on it you know I'm just sitting here being like oh it's so silly you should be able to smuggle stuff anywhere you want but I think about all I'm from South Florida you've got people from South America and all over the place that are smuggling little plants in because it's tropical these plants from their home they are bringing so many diseases literally Jersey palm decline they have straight-up palm decline there because people are bringing palm seeds and growing palm seeds that were laminated yeah it's a huge deal yeah it's scary I mean you know we truly we want to find varieties that we know are gonna work right but we also want to be able to work with as many things as we can so it's really just finding the lineage and delving into where are these plants coming from can i source plans of that lineage from whoever you know in the area that's mainly what we look into do you have any other growers in your area cannabis or hemp because that would be a freakin nightmare if you had people growing hemp for biomass no it's okay in Humboldt County there is a lot of cannabis growing you know there's tea farm everywhere you look is there pollen I'm in there saying if there's pollen in the air and your she gets pollen there could potentially be pollen there could potentially be molds from other Wright farms and things like that so we have to be very careful you know a with who we let on the property be with you know how we filter and maintain the air quality and our property is this completely outdoor these are greenhouses what are we doing with the the big properties are outdoor they're full season that's just right in the Sun you know exposed to as many you know anything that happens yes there's a greenhouse you see matter space in that even there there will be greenhouses there will be all sorts of stuff that I put on those properties it's still gonna have full Sun and greenhouse or full Sun depending on how you grow depending on you know what varieties you're doing you could have very good full Sun that goes well depending you know how your season is out there really it's seasonal you know you could have a fall that's extremely rainy and damages your whole crop in the six-day period you know you could have a fall season that's sunny amazing and warm and there's no rain in sight all through flower and everything was beautiful she kept your dust down and you maintained your property and you did well enough to be able to like oh yeah I can you know harvest these plants that are gonna be very well do very well for you know some of those extracts yeah I mean you're talking about hmm having some problems you know if the weather is wrong mm-hmm or doesn't cooperate you know that basically catastrophic crop failure totally yeah we're doing all sorts of stuff that we can to mitigate that as the season progresses you know we're watching weather we're watching humidity we're watching as things are moving up the coast and into the mountains it's what you do though well we can prepare you know like if if a heavy rains coming you know that's gonna be very damaging the other show if you if things aren't stake properly your trellis properly not like that it's gonna just destroy your field you know just based on that alone so that's um you can do not even though huge raindrops or hail hitting those bus cream yeah yeah and I mean we we're trying to develop different rain protection systems that we will put up once the plans get more in the flour and it'll just be short little lean-to type frames that basically go over and they'll be big but they're only gonna be able to protect a few of the chosen plans right one it's not gonna be the whole thing you know so we'll start going through the that whole property was done from seed so that is also we're doing Fino hunting there so you need that yeah some special ones over there yes I mean there's we pop 2,000 seeds you know so it's a big female hunt we got the varieties from a guy Jesse his company as bio vortex they do amazing stuff at Humboldt Wow he's in another leaf Trinidad area not actually I think his farm is actually really cool know him I think I have run into him before yeah he's a great guy he I could probably swing it his way too but uh he does so many talks and writing and get a home but sure absolutely in a cannabis and absolutely gonna get your culture you know my beef is with everybody that's that's putting their their lives on the line their livelihoods on the line for cannabis is that in Florida if I were to have you know 600 acres of palm trees and they got a disease or they got wiped out by a hurricane you know what happens I get to buy myself a Mercedes man the government comes in it gives me 50 70 90 percent of what the hell that entire crop was worth and I had a check for three million you know I'm sorry if it's that many acres yeah yeah tens or twenties a million oh yeah I just sold my entire inventory before before it was even mature yeah if we get hit with you know as I guess outdoor cannabis growers there's no catastrophic insurance for us I'm sure there will be once event organization happens but kind of gotta be hard to get people to throw their life savings into you know or I should even say it's just an investor and that's and that's the thing and that's why you know we do what we do you know that logic is like we need the best material we you know that when you're getting something from us it's going to be the best because we can't take some thing that failed you know write anything that failed it's it's it's either has to be compost or its you know if if if it can be you know saved in any way from hydrocarbon extraction but that's you know what's scary about that is right people you know lose a crop or something like that and they pull it to that and it's who knows what mycotoxins heavy metals things like that are contained within that yeah how do you feel about BHO you solvent list newt or what I typically only smoke solving this hash um just because you want to solve this company yeah and I'm you know I'm in the industry I see what happens you know with I do carbon extractions and don't get me wrong there are some amazing right carbon extractions out there and it's important that you know that that side of the industry exists in Georgia they're you know keeping the earth clean and they're you know doing what it takes you know I could see one be one type you know blast rooms and things like that and I think it's fine the exist bad promotion for the cannabis industry for extracts of if they're blowing up with Dirk scanning themselves we don't we don't want that and you know a lot of times people don't know the difference between distillate or solvent lives or something like that you know found someone like us someone like us would know because it's its second nature whatever by now but it's like you know when I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or I talked to someone sharing Oklahoma or Alabama or you know somewhere like it's all good there even people out in California you know northern Northern California you know they're there's so much distillate there's so much hydrocarbon extraction everybody's running to ashes big freakin farms up there okay there's nobody that can press come close to processing that size of farms yet which is you know I mean so it's like look like a factory over there Shh I mean they are a lot of the hydrocarbon facilities around 24/7 and yeah I can take on a thousand pounds a day Jesus mm-hmm Wow what do you think you guys's capacity is gonna be in California I mean you're gonna need to have some see you've got hundreds of acres yeah it's an it's not quite that big in again we're selective for solve unless gotta take the best out of these fields we take only the best so it's it's something that when we're doing and we do about a hundred pounds fresh per per wash is what will got we what we do got um so that only happens two to three times a week typically it's something that takes a lot more effort you know through the whole process it's something that we can't really just throw it in the tube blasts it out throw write purge oven and let it sit for three weeks it's like there's a lot of processing and there's a lot of maintaining and being very careful and being you know quick but also you know taking your time yeah what how do you get the young quality and quality out when it comes to when it comes to you know Roz and I guess how do you get it to where what if you have a problem I guess is what I'm trying to say in the grow yeah soil so it's kind of tough to correct that yeah it's some things off balance if there's you know some something that may have been watered wrong or you know fed improperly yeah that a B word what about bugs bugs I mean bugs are definitely a problem you know if you're if you're dealing with large scale cultivation but you know if you're maintaining cleanliness you're maintaining rigorous integrated pest management systems leaving meaning predatory insects very cool in vegetative state never in flower it's also using you know specific essential oil sprays or oil sprays that could be used in vegetative state never in flower beautiful you know one thing that we do is we make sure that our products aren't sprayed if it's coming to me cannot even come close to being sprayed it can't and that's why if a farmer that's why we have to be so selective that's why we have to grow and we have to inspect product you know even if like our own farmers are out there there they might be doing something to save their own crop so we have to go out there and inspect that and make sure that's either not happening or if it is happening we need to move on and get to the plants that you know or part of the crop or even move through the crop altogether you know and only take you know something from yang on their farm I had tasted and by no means a connoisseur I like extracts don't get me wrong but I'm not a connoisseur and I tasted something that I was like this tastes like sulfur like it looks good he's like sulfur like obey me use the sulfur burner and you know a little bit too late that could be you know there's especially you know if you're an old-school farmer right and you're doing things you're trying to be organic you know you could use a sulfur burn you know but that nowadays most people are aware that that comes through a in the cannabis smoke would be way more in the concentrates you know so but there are varieties you can lineage you know coach lineage that could the diesel lineage that could lean towards like that skunky sulfuric almost type smell got a stir so you know if it's important that know your grower it's important to know you're know where your weeds coming from grow your own most importantly I mean that's why we you know it's why we do what we do is so that we can grow something that you can be certain is going to actually be something that you would drove you ain't smoke you know we don't we would never put something something in our products that you wouldn't I wouldn't personally use myself there's so many people that I just let like b-grade stuff pass through just because they're like oh nobody will know what he can tell showing in extracts it's this or that or it's going to this dispensary they'll buy I've been dispensaries and I'm like oh you buy the shift exactly yeah so it's important for us you know to sharing you know relationship with the growers and maintain the relationship with people that were selling to you know yeah what's up with the dispensaries on the other end because you kind of middleman as far you can't go in and actually rep your product during no I mean some dispensaries allow us to come in and you know frame help market help train route kind of create awareness yeah if you come in you don't know what's sitting on the Shelf right why are you gonna buy it you know well like you got this pen people are in the cartridges it's kind of going away from that you know putting your extract in a pen and having to reload it these things are super low-profile super convenient what's the first off go into a dispensary you know be like hey what kind of good cartridges do you have and sometimes they'll go none don't buy them here they're all mix of propylene glycol and stuff like that what's the secret first just cuz I'm in the cartridges because I'm picked this one up so cuz I'm gonna hit it so something like this out what's the secret to make them something a good cart what's the difference in a good part of a shitty cart this has no cut this has none of the propylene glycol MCT oil any bogus food grade this or that else is 100% from cannabis and it's also and lessly made so it's it's a high terpene extract put into a vape cart is what it is it's not something that somebody made to get rich quick it's yeah this is real hash I remember they made more convenient yes something you could melt your hash into and then you could put it in your vape pens yeah and I mean it's terrible there's a little bit of post-process like you you if you just stick show into a cart it's gonna crystallize it's gonna kind of coagulate and it'll be hard to smoke lawyers you know so creating the proper terpene ratio and things like that is very important you know and that's is that strain dependent or that's very strained dependent with us it's a hundred percent strain depending because we can't really manipulate the terpenes too much or the constant we can somewhat manipulate concentration right can't we can't change what's there you know it's like if what's there is there so we're just kind of working with what we have to kind of make this yeah makes sense if you guys make carts you guys make it what does he cause batters yeah the the carts something we've been doing for the past two years year and a half something to make it more convenient sitting so that also somebody who doesn't have a rig and doesn't typically dab right can actually use our product this is super this never really happened before the vape car it was not quality was yeah yeah so it's like being able to formulate you know the get it from this to that was huge yeah it was the game for us and really has made it so that my mom my grandma my aunts and uncle rate of have able to have been able to try my product whereas before they can I get a really good order yeah even though what it was you know couldn't couldn't even wrap their head around it yeah but we we you know what with most hash makers you know the the goal isn't I need my car nice oil you know a lot of times we're taking now because so many people love the rosin and things like that we're taking our ninety micron pressing that right having specified batches that are ninety might come or 90 120 mixtures sure like that the higher grade microns and that's what's getting some that's more often than not that's what we're pressing now because it's just what people are after and water hash is also good side of the market but it's it probably accounts for twenty twenty percent of the actual solving with sales and those riding the whole grand scheme of things seems to go quick do no otter hash yeah it's expensive yeah you know the high grades there's unless you're doing you know extremely large batches there's not a crazy amount of it you know maybe a couple hundred grams you know something like that so it's something that's very limited something that's not you can't take something low grade and make it into ninety micron ISIL it has to be grown perfectly it has to be done perfectly actually washed perfectly so we presented and given you the consumer perfectly as well you know so we have to keep it maintained you know from start to finish you know a cold environment on it you know we have to make sure the people who are selling our product right the consumer are also keeping in the right environment and then we have to let our consumer know and they have to have the education to be able to know to put this in the fridge or to keep it cold they asked something that maintains that you know environment we have a kegerator and we never use it having a kegerator in the house is actually a bad idea so why I started hiding my dad's in there man they you just don't have enough refrigerators once people know you keep them in the fridge yeah they figure it out me yeah every fridge in the house yeah bad hey we're talking about these cartridges you obviously if you were in for a year and a half ago you were getting in the days you were a little bit ahead of the trend ahead look her how they how do you keep a head into curve and what's coming up next around the next curve for cannabis yeah we're always trying to keep ahead next big curb you know we're looking at I see a lot of people are like pushing for you know really like colored high flavor hi hi flavor profile resins like 710 it's white yeah yep yep so it's really it's shooting for that shooting for the holler proper color high terpene me but also still maintaining you know the right you know potency you know because if you're pulling too early on some of this stuff you're just getting something that tastes like cucumbers and like wait up just doesn't even get you that high it's like if you want something that has the full body flavor like you have to take it to its prime maturity you know we we have to get out of the kind of mentality that ambered trichomes like when it starts to amber that's starting to show my maturity cuz that's like that's already overly matured you know like yes we're trying to pull a little bit before that ever even happens before the first amber trichome happens like the day before that would be the perfect you know yeah I'm just saying and this is I mean cuz you're trying to bring something great to your customer something extraordinary so when they try all of them they like to dab logic that's that's the one I like yeah how educated is the customer did they get it a shopping price do you have to it's just like cmed you're gonna we can educate them on that stuff or they end up buying hemp seed oil for you know eight dollars on Amazon and thinking oh everything is good ya know I mean education is huge most people they don't know the difference between like quality organic solvent list and some low-grade hydrocarbon I straight up they don't eighteen dollar shadow yeah and with CRC tech like the color mediation for like hydrocarbons and things like that I heard something about what the hell is color remediation they're pulling chlorophyll and you know oxidants out of out of the hash you know which is great because that leads to a higher grade hash but it's also like discern or both from like something that is high grade you know it's like okay this this just is high grade because I grew it right I maintain it I took care of it I processed it right you know this came from any run of a mill place with who-knows-who doing them whatever and it's coming out looking the same you know that's the that's the thing yeah plastic surgeries you know a couple yeah so it's gonna be then you know now going back through the customer finding you know the nose the trained eye things like that being able to actually understand what what you're getting you know yeah and that's hard you know if we're we're still in the phases of trying to teach people what good genetics are you know and you more if they're not even understanding the Terp why those genetics are good the terpenes that they're producing the cannabinoid profiles that they're producing them we're gonna be like then they're gonna just be sitting there clueless when anybody can call anything whatever they were you know I mean most of the country thinks independence atiba there's two varieties of cannabis one gets you up let me get you down exactly yeah and it's who's that well who's your I've heard I was actually at the dispensary one time it must be right after Social Security checks were issued hmm to what everybody was 55 60 years old so you know I mean they were older yeah I was just kind of wondering like where the growth is I actually was talking to somebody and they were telling me look the people that are smoking weed are already smoking weed you know what we're really after now is the people that aren't smoking weed the other 85% of population we're looking for you guys say you know ever think in that that way or is that why you got stuff like these pens yeah they really make it I think what the vape is designed for its to give it to anyone who can basically take a hit you know if you can take a hit you can try this pen there isn't even a button on it right it's magnetic it's just you know it just slides right in yeah it's so easy to use it's nothing like heating up a nail and take your day about measuring a dose all that kind of stuff this you just measure with the pup knows how hard you're drawing you know so it's it's per a buddy of mine called me I've been talking about this guy because I feel terrible about it a guy knew back in Florida had a stroke and you just case just told me he goes my body's hanging off me you know it's my hair and my leg of my arm and he's like it starts hurting and I was met recommended that he grabbed one of these pens and check him out it's not a cannabis user and magically he got one and he's like dude I like it and it's really cool cuz in the beginning you could take like a couple of one hit and you're like wow yeah I have a friend that has psoriatic arthritis shoutout to Paul and yeah it's really bad man where sometimes he just can't move his hands and it sucks cuz he's uh has like a technical job as well he will take one hit of the right strain and he just goes like immediately he goes I'm all better I'm all better mm-hmm David it's amazing and I was absolutely I don't know if you got any medical cannabis stories or not I mean like that is so inspirational to me totally my yellow rooftops you know my grandma actually has went through cancer twice she has you know used cannabis to help her right through different chemo treatments and things like that she's fully off chemo now and she's only using cannabis and CBD you try to help and you know so that's kind of where she's at sure the whole world would change their mind on cannabis if somebody handed them a joint when they had a stomachache okay know what I mean that's all they would have to do is when he had a snowman somebody joint they got I instantly feel better I can actually empathize with the psoriatic arthritis guy cuz think about having a horrible stomach game taking one hit of weed and being like I can get up off the floor I can get out of bed you know terrible state your intestines I've never been ashamed of cannabis always been me Oh doing what I can to let people know that this legit shouldn't be considered deal with all the other drugs while the other armful drugs know it's a medicine I agree 100% yeah and that's kind of what we do - it's a logic is the reason we're organic the reason we choose solvent less is because we want to give you the purest truest medicine you know we don't want anything getting in the way between you and nature in this plant you know we're just presenting you with as close as you can get to it you know so it's it's then up to you you know to use this medicine however you choose you know whether it's dope and your consciousness or whether it's to heal your ailments or just a plain old you know relax you know like all of those things are so important you know to de-stress and to unwind like it's part of why we all use cannabis and it's so so important you know and that's why I think cannabis users as a whole have that mentality in that mindset of for lack of a better word we're chill you know sure it affects you I think I think it affects your brain you smoke enough weed it shows you out of it that's actually a generalization know some crazy [ __ ] just smoke weed all day they're not the least bit chill oh well yeah no I mean thinking of one that was a pink shirt you know just knows how much weed they use but let me ask you a question so we're talking about the expansion we're talking - everyone should smoke weed all right they everyone should consider it a medicine anyhow so do you want federal legalization that's a super double-edged sword they're super sharp one I mean I don't look at medicine as pharmaceutical in any way you know I hate do it yeah they do they do they think you know put it into a pill or make it something that's completely controllable something that we can maintain and control reacts down to the milligrams same way oxycontin is a molecule that they can control exactly you know and by doing that they take away the whole plan the full spectrum you know aspect of it and using THC on its own I mean all the studies show that it's way way way less beneficial than using in conjunction with Kurt beanies and other cannabinoids that are found actually within those plants so no to federal legalization just cuz just gonna commoditize I mean federal legalization I think will be the last thing that happens what I think will end up happening is states will end up partnering with one another we'll be like we'll see California Oregon Washington State interstate they'll partner what's going in there yeah all of a sudden you know it'll open up other other avenues for other states and it'll be able to follow a trail through our country one way or another you know and as long as that money files which follows a trail the federal government somehow will probably be ok yeah exactly I mean it's everybody knew it was coming you know it was like the Jack Herer initiative of 2012 it was his whole thing you know it's prophecy it's good there's no way you're super you can't win an election by saying that you're against cannabis there's no way yeah once cuz we've been fighting for so long brother kids yelling it yeah I love it I love it worriers boom and we're back and magically we're taking - yo so where can people get this stuff anyway so you can grab it at vert and verts and Fort Collins if you're in this area otherwise if you're in Denver you can always get it at Verde if you're in Boulder you can get it at Verde nice that Verde carries the largest selection of dialogic products overall so deal deal I appreciate it man yeah there you go there you go thanks for bringing such thanks for bringing samples absolutely it is gorgeous this is absolutely growing always glad to be over there [Music]

back to pop on 4/20 as always thank you for joining this channel won't we get started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "T3ja_B5xktQ": "so how do you fix a loose tap the tap on this one is okay we're six months on from a repair that's still working really well with the cartridge here the tap itself has detached so instead of this spinning here and the Hat tap spinning around the whole works are spinning around if you look at the bottom here underneath and find out what needs to be tightened in order to fix that up so here we go we are down underneath the sink and back under here is where the tap is you can see all of the hoses and fittings coming in and see how loose there's a house flopping around what we need to do is tighten up for that bulb there so we need to get a hostess spanner to tighten him up and there it's kind of do the job okay that's very very just come loose over time so grab a spanner and tighten that up we put the tap in the position we want it first and then tighten it up and see how that goes okay so what we need to do is do up that nut I've got the tap in the position that I wanted so that's just a matter of doing up there not this guy here ten was too small so I'm using an 11 and I'm dropping this almost nobody here I'm gonna soak it into this hello I can't actually put a ring spanner on it we go with that so the smaller the tool is gonna be the better up here just in tax right now it's coming spender I'm using really it's a bit to the back wall so give these Spanish you can hold them this way and then turn them over and you'll get a little bit further when you're in a tight position that's what the whole offset so you can see a little bit too long but it's probably tight enough we'll go upstairs and have a look so you go back up top and off the handle up says that this is in the front that's fully around a coal and that's around a hot and this is now moving rather than the whole tap moving and that's as it should be it's got a full range of movement and we've got cold over here where it's always been and hot straightforward and you can adjust that around you can loosen it off of it and adjust that however you want that's where you actually make that change as to where it that where the temperature is but that's where it's been so that'll be most familiar to us so there you go all fixed no now under flopping all over the place and ready for service again [Music] you", "2y5F430CS2A": "hey guys as that picture we're checking out the rhythm cartridge and about a third of the way through this thing and let's take a look at the light too you know it's it's okay it's not really great and it's not really strong this is the energy one and it's about 70 to 73 percent THC and you know it's it's not terrible it's just not strong as the other cars and considering that it's $45 which is the same price as other cards that makes it not that great of a value because I right before this I was eating this the serene heart and the serene cart kind of blows us away and then I was also hitting the can of eight if I got at the same time as this and that blows it away so comparing to the other Nevada brands there's just a lot stronger out there for the same price now if someone wants something it's not super blow you away this might be it the one thing I do notice about this this is the energy one and it really doesn't make you slow it doesn't really make you that tired and that is a good thing however if I was looking for an energy one the city trees energy disposable that I tried I don't know a few months ago I thought was more energetic than this and this will still get you there you just got to hit it more so essentially the value is not as good because I got hit this five times you get the same effect is hitting you know like the city trees or roots like twice then that's means I'm paying more than twice as much for to get the same effect so for someone that's not like a hit at all the all the time kind of person like most of you put it right for our site are you know and this might be a good cartridge for you if you want somethin weaker or you want something like you know for your dad who's smoked in the 70s this might be a really good option I think it's I think they'll come back with something stronger and we'll be testing with them again and it'll be better this is usually how how it goes you know we try some of these brands well these smaller bands when they come out it seems like they got something like sixty some seventy seven percent and then come back and it's way better you know and I would say that happen with lucid oils the lucid oils original I tried their syringes like 68 percent I was like it's really good oil but that's strong then they come back with the new one it's 86 and it blows you away so I think rhythm will come back with something stronger and I'll definitely trying them again other thing I didn't like that much about this was the taste this has more of a co2 ish taste than a distill it tastes I prefer that nice distill it taste that one of the cleanest tasting distill 'ti kind of taste was that can of a taupe cartridge I really like that one so this on straight not so hot on taste not so hot room for improvement totally and I bet you will be reviewing this again and will be much better at some point but for now the rythm cartridge is probably something I would not get again when there's other cartridges available but it may be a good option for someone who does want to get too tired and you know isn't you smoking stuff that's as strong as how strong some of these really strong cards are at this point so we'll take a hit you can see how it hits good thing about it real Cecil hardware I believe let's just triple check that pretty sure Tyrell so you saw let's see yep you got the Jupiter it's real see so so we'll go ahead and take a hit on this and you guys can see how it hit so hold on one sec so now we'll give it a head you guys can see how this thing hints it's good yeah I mean I'm down in my absolute best C cell battery let someone borrow my vessel so this is still a pretty good battery that's king cloud mini I think it works really good clones but still gives it a good hit and yeah it's just not as strong as the other ones but it's alright so not gonna get this one too thumbs up but not giving exactly two thumbs down either it's just something I wouldn't get at this point and I think in the future they'll make it stronger and then the rhythm cartridge something I'll probably try again definitely thanks for watching guys this dab connection and have a great week", "uv2qrTaKd3o": "hi it's mattad Rafal studios and welcome to our review of the heavy hitters prefilled cannabis concentrate vaporizer pens [Music] we're going to be reviewing three different products from heavy hitters today we're gonna be reviewing the 2.2 gram cartridge the one gram cartridge and we're also going to be reviewing the actual vaporizer battery pen itself so let's go ahead and unbox these things and see what we have here first off is do we have the actual vaporizer pen and this is the pen that's actually provided by heavy hitters that you can purchase that's branded by heavy hitters it includes a little USB charger plug as well as the pen itself and that's a 5-10 thread pin okay and now we're gonna unbox the 1 gram cartridge this is an OG Kush cartridge which is a hybrid but it's in indica dominant and that's the one gram cartridge and now we're gonna unbox the 2.2 gram cartridge this is the ha static cartridge and this is a new flavor it's the blue dream ok so now let's take a closer look at these individual items first we're going to look at the battery itself now the heavy-hitters battery that is available through heavy hitters and which is recommended for the device is just the right wattage at 4 watts it also has no buttons or anything on it the only thing that you can see is the logo on the side for heavy hitters and then the 510 threaded end that actually plugs into the USB charger that's the simple kind of USB charger that plugs directly into USB and you could charge that with other kind of chargers as well ok now we're going to look at the 1 gram pen and this is the cartridge pin for the 1 gram that's the og cush I'm a big AG fan so I'm really looking forward to trying this out in a minute and it's really simple it's just a one piece I know there was a little rubber cap that goes over the 510 thread there on one end but you just could discard the little rubber cap and then you see it's just a simple cartridge that threads directly onto the pin and these are sort of low wattage it's a 3.7 watts recommend it there so you could try these on other pins but you wouldn't want to try these on a modern of high wattage device okay now we're going to take a closer look at the big 2.2 grand pen and these are monsters I really like this the concept here of just making a tank that's gonna last you for a couple of weeks and also a big fan of blue dreams so looking also for it to trying this out and you can see this pin is so big that it's actually the cartridge is a little bit longer than the pen itself but it's very similar to the other pen other than the length of it it has screws right on to the end of the battery and it's the same battery that you can use on both size cartridges look at that at this like a it's like a rifle or something they're just not rifle you can see the comparing the two you can also see that the two oils look different as these are strange specific and you can also see out of the quality of the oil is very good how thick it is that takes that bubbles so long to roll up but one thing to be cautioned with and this is a lot of vaporizer pens they will roll off the table and break so be careful you don't want to break your heavy head or you'll cry okay so it now comes the favorite part the part of that we've been waiting for here at Roth house studios and this is amazing a pen if you've tried any kind of these cartridges you just can't equal the taste I really like the little light-up end there when you you don't have to do anything when you draw through the pen it lights it up and also ignites the the vaporizer atomizers so you don't have to press any buttons or anything like that it's just air controlled and then I had a little fun here to try both flavors at once that OG Kush was delicious by the way very piney a little bit of lemon but very piney and delicious and the same goes for the Blue Dream it wasn't as pioneer but it was a much more lemony citrusy flavor and just awesome the flavor on these is incredible and heavy-hitters is the correct name you can get major puffs especially for the low wattage coils you can still get major big puffs and like I said we've tried these on multiple batteries and they work good with most of your low wattage batteries but you do need to be careful not to use too high of a wattage of a battery because you get burnt out the coil in the atomizer and it won't work another thing to be cautious with about using these heavy headers or any kind of the cartridges or a lot of these cartridges especially the high-end strong ones like this is that you can find yourself overmedicating very easily because it's such a pleasant experience it tastes so good and it doesn't make you cough and choke that after a few hits you may just find yourself staring out into the window aimlessly and forgetting what you're doing so be careful not to over Medicaid and don't drive or operate machinery obviously anytime but especially in the case with with these heavy headers because they are appropriately named-- you will definitely get very very high off of these all right very easily super high quality very premium premium oil right here [Music] so that comes to my review or my rating for the heavy hitters and I'm gonna give it five stars I really can't find any problems with it the only problem that I have is you're gonna be upset if you let it roll off the table and break it which is only a testament to the product itself just top-notch product so I would like to say thank you to heavy hitters who sent out these pens for

hands get it i appreciate you now what we do here is oh i'm sorry how rude am i not to introduce myself i go by the name taz and i review [ __ ] mainly hemp um and today we have a product coming from one of my favorite companies i saw this little team i saw this little team it's really a two-part review i saw this little team uh and i've used it in one of my lives and i had to crack it open for you guys in this review it's coming from one of my favorite companies which is called black tie cbd uh you may have heard of them oh oh something that doesn't mean a lot to you can mean a lot to someone else like one right there and hitting that subscribe button so what we have here today is the jupiter c cell palm power supply that was a lot and that is my rosary hitting my whiskey decanter that little ting ting bell you heard um this is the palm uh power supply it's like let's just open it up let's slide it open it doesn't make a magnify magnificent noise when you slide it open and here is what you have they put their logo on it black tie now what this is let me show you what all you get in here i'll turn it around so you can see the back side see that see that now what you have here is uh this is something that you can use for your cartridges um what i've learned about this thing is also that the battery on this when you charge it up last a lot longer than the uh your average pin you know how you usually just put it on top of your little pin uh but the battery on these last a lot longer in fact let me show you how to use it i'm gonna put that right there and i'm gonna try to open up this right here what we have here now what we have here is a little something special a little something this also comes from black tie this is the cbd delta eight vape cartridge so this is not just straight delta eight by itself it has cbd mixed with it which is my favorite way to consume my delta eight uh some people say that delta a kind of gives them a little bit of anxiety you know similar to delta nine uh but i've noticed that when it's mixed with the cbd it's tends to be a little bit smoother and less anxiety causing so this is one milligram and this is not the kid so it's just going to be the cartridge by itself and black tie again they gonna they gonna put a logo on there i do like that um it's child proof so you gotta push this little button and pull now i will say this i've never hold on oh this is the first time this is the first time that i was actually able to push that button down which makes it child proof and slide this out now this is the pineapple say it with me pineapple did that pineapple this is that pineapple this is what your cartridge looks like when you take it out see that voila good and thick good and thick lightly golden lightly golden now what you do is first you take off this little part down here at the bottom wow voila and see this right here oh [ __ ] okay so your palm power cell comes with these two little screw devices so let's get one of those out they give you two in case you lose one so what you're going to want to do is you take that put that down you screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like so screw that onto the bottom of your cartridge like that now now you're ready to insert it into your palm which it'll just go like this see that little slot made perfect for it you put that down in there like that and it has a little bit of magnetization to it i don't even know if that's a word but it's magnetized so you put that down in there look watch this again and now it's in there will not come out or anything the next thing you got to do is just simply pull on it you just pull on it so um before i take my first pull let me say this salute to health wealth and self self love is the best love if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please please get to the closest man tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself that's some serious [ __ ] my brother would say that deep little bro and i like it when they do that salute okay and this little thing is tight it's tiny and comfortable i don't know why i like this more than the pen i don't know if it's because i can grip it like that and it's wrong it's gone you know i can be you know at work stepping out on breakfast like huh what today no no no i'm listening nothing rather what's in my hand nothing i have nothing in my hand nothing at all i let the smoke out on the side like so the pineapple flavor is amazing i feel like spongebob squarepants oh my god the pineapple i thought i loved the banana excuse me yeah i thought i love the banana and i do i do love the banana don't get it twisted i do love the banana but the pineapple oh my god it tastes beautiful this is beautiful this is gorgeous i like this a lot i promise i don't know why i like this so much better than the pen but i really do and i feel like it gets more airflow excuse me what i really like about is just this little square design it's easy to just slide down in the pocket i'm good to go and like i said the battery lasts longer in these than in your average pen now when you pull on it there's a little light let me see if you can see that no you can't but anyway oh i'll show it did you see that little light that lit up when you pull that's how you know you're good to go oh my god oh huh okay now to me the effects of the delta eight for me oh if i get my breath from coffin it is a focus type feel um you i feel focused when i'm using delta a creative um i don't have that frontal lobe like blurry feeling like delta nine gives me it just gives me that focus feel and then i get the from the cbd i get the relaxation the drop in the shoulders i get the i can feel the anxiety begin to leave and then i just i it just genuinely makes me happy one million trillion percent gives me the money though i can tell you that right now uh but genuinely just a relaxed feel relaxed and focused feel and in the little palm palette i said the palm palette they used to be a phone i'm showing my age uh but in the palm power supply i really really like it now the pen gives me that feel you know it goes between the fingers so i can but it's a little heavy i don't know why because this forces you to grab it like this or like this it's just like second nature and it's just easy right i'm i've been literally going back and forth in my mind trying to decide if i like the banana or if i like the pineapple better i was so so so impressed with that banana the first time i had it i'm still impressed with it but this pineapple is so on point like i don't know how they're getting these flavors to be so on point the way they are but this pineapple it really does not taste like some artificial fake pineapple type candy type thing it literally tastes like a fresh slice of pineapple it tastes boozy like pineapple not pineapple pineapple that's what it tastes like listen uh black time i gotta give you two thumbs up again man i gotta give you two thumbs up i've tried the banana delta eight i've tried the delta eight card that just had um it was not flavored at all it was just mixed with cbd and it was not flavored and now i'm trying the pineapple and you guys have not let me down yet man and i'm just i i'm sold on the on the palm power supply it's a must so far black tie is my favorite place to get my delta eight and i'm gonna tell you why it's the only place i've gotten delta eight and i trust them as a company that's why i go to them i know it's not gonna be no bs product and sometimes things can you know you get let down so when i want certain things i go to specific companies because i know i'm not going to be let down and this is one of man shout out to aka mr copius i appreciate you and shout out to you guys the pineapple is definitely worth checking out this little contraption this pawn power supply it's definitely definitely a win for me um thank you guys for stopping through as i like to say on smoking legal keep it positive we'll keep it pushing get it keep it positive or keep it pushing if you have any questions for me uh ask

high do i look high what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel so this is another three chive delta eight vape cartridge review the last one that i did did so well that i just well i had to do another one if i release a video and it gets 800 hits or 800 views in a for like a week oh yeah i'm definitely doing another video so the one that i got is blue dream and it's a one milliliter container brand new sealed and that's how i like it and you can see right there it contains 95 percent eight delta eight th oil and then five percent of [ __ ] which you know whatever i guess you gotta i guess it can't be a hundred percent or it would probably just knock you on your ass and stuff uh the directions remove the silicone cover and screw into the battery do not over tighten take one puff and wait 20 minutes wow wait 20 minutes um usage is between one and two puffs let's see here i'm trying to focus it for you guys i can't focus it whatever uh says do not operate any machinery while using this product do not use if pregnant nursing or under the age of 21 this may cause a positive drug test well no [ __ ] oh my god uh let's see here if you need more typical usage it's one or two puffs do not operate wait a minute where's that one part at wait 20 minutes before determining if you need more oh okay 5 10 battery 100 percent hint driving contains 0.3 is that a 9 thc batch 6 out of 15 2021 batch id three chives fishery blah blah blah blah all right blue dream sweet so i have a couple other ones over here these are the fx these are delta eight fx cartridges um and i designed this little thing to keep them in the upright for me because sometimes i'll run out and these right here will be enough to get you by for a few days especially if you leave them in the upright these are this was like orange crush and like granddaddy purple if i remember correctly i didn't really care um for the granddaddy purple i do want to say one thing though there is a big difference between the ethics cartridge and the delta eight cartridges i feel like the delta eight cartridges these are put together better they just seem to be i don't know i don't have any leakage they hardly ever clog they just seem to be a better cartridge than the fx the fx are also a lot cheaper too these are like 30 something dollars and these are like 60 something dollars okay now the effects of this all right let's say you're sitting on the couch smoking a blunt there you go you're going to get high but this is great because you can be out public you could be in a mall walking around hitting this and people are just going to think that you're vaping and that's the beautiful part about it and it delivers i mean just one one good hit delivers like a serious bond grip i mean it's depending on your tolerance and how much you smoke it can get you really really really really really high um like for instance i got friends that do not smoke like me i consider myself to be a pothead meaning that i i blaze it up every day we smoke it down okay that's just me i've been like that for 20 years um but we're not talking about me this i hit it one time and i'm like whoo all right if i get somebody that doesn't smoke like me and they hit it they gotta sit down and sometimes they're out for the count like uh like i actually had one friend hit it and it ruined her whole night she felt like [ __ ] it just messed her up and then i had another buddy uh i mean it put his ass on the couch so i guess the effects is just different depending on who you are and how much you smoke but let me tell you what it's definitely worth it it's discreet nobody knows that you have it plus there's no smell like you blaze that [ __ ] up man you hit it pow pow pow you get a big old dragon's breath cloud and it don't smell like weed it's awesome you can take it to work that's the best part about it man is that there's no paraphernalia there's no weed nobody knows you have it on you the only way somebody's gonna know you have it is if they physically see it no smells man i i've been pulled over by the police and i had this on me he didn't even ask me not clean as a whistle goodbye give me my ticket leave awesome these things definitely have their benefits definitely and if you're going to have this you got to have a 510 battery okay this is an e-leaf very simple 510 battery plugs into the bottom i don't know an hour charge you're good to go all you do is you hold the button wait for it to get to about there and then you start hitting it hit it slow you're not trying to rip on it you're just trying to take a slow even deep breath and even that might be too much for you three child blue dream now one thing i did like about it was all they had so many selections for these and then they told you about what they did like this is a sativa brand um this is supposed to give you clarity um it's not supposed to make you foggy it's supposed to give you energy and make you awake and whatever whatever whatever like it claims what it is it's a um a sativa synthetic it's a blend of you know indica and this brand i mean like it tells you what they are and what they're mixed with their strands and everything so you really can't go wrong so it's not like you don't know what you're buying you know what i mean sorry if there's a little bit of an echo i'm trying to do this privately this is illegal in my state you know so you really don't want to be advertising what you're doing that's the other thing like a cop a cop knows what this is because this does not look like a typical vape that's the other thing that you need to be aware of this is very identifiable if they're a cop and they deal with this [ __ ] they've seen this before they will know exactly what you have in your hand so be aware of that uh your average person not so much you know i mean you go out for a cigarette break you hit it once or twice nobody's going to even say it or even notice it but be careful because police they they probably will know what the hell that is i mean because all vape cartridges come the same basically the same look you know all right we're actually starting to get to the meat and potatoes oh come on [ __ ] come on out now here's another thing i like is that they come with these uh get out damn it [ __ ] it's pressure treated uh is that they come with these plastic things right to keep them covered now when i transport mine for instance see like these these even have it on them when i transport them because sometimes i'll take this with me and then i'll take another flavor with me it's very important that you keep that cap on there all right because if you don't keep that cap on there lint and trash and garbage and other things that are in your pocket will get into these little holes and ports and you don't want that because that's going to mess everything up for you so it's very important that you keep these little plastic covers and if you want to even keep the mouthpiece because you know see like this mouthpiece see all the stuff that's in there that's from it being in my pocket like lint and trash and other things get up inside of that you know what i mean yeah you don't want that that's bad so definitely keep your plastic covers man you got to keep those and try to store it upright because if you laying it down you can take a good chance of it leaking and it'll this [ __ ] takes forever it's like molasses to go back in the upright um but let's let's plug it in and check it out not only that check out the quality this is the end cap that came off of the uh the new delta eight cartridge see it see how thick it is all right and then this is the end cap that comes now i ain't trying to knock the the fx vapes i'm just trying to justify the 30 something dollars more that they want for the vape you know [Music] all right and then here's theirs see what i'm saying see the difference look at the difference in the caps big difference this one's nice and meaty and this one's real thin and kind of cheesy looking but uh you know i guess that's part of the difference is that you get better coverage with it also when i bought these these just come in like kind of like this thing here uh but it doesn't have anything covering the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is wide open so but with these you get a mouthpiece covered which is nice because like i said i transport these in my pocket and stuff so yeah you know what that um this this right here it kind of it kind of sneaks up on you god damn oh my god i'm sweating look i'm sweating can you see my head look at my head look that was one hit one hit how do i look do i look like i've been like i'm high do i look high yeah one hit y'all one hit damn yeah see i can go in there right now smoke a few bowls that [ __ ] won't get me like how i am right now good god oh [ __ ] all right yes um forgot what i was saying yep don't remember now okay so back to what i don't remember i was talking about y'all need to get this i don't know what else to tell y'all three chive delta eight vapes leave me a comment subscribe to my channel check out my other videos i build computers and do all kinds of custom water cooling and technology stuff so you all need to come and check that out check out my channel i appreciate y'all for watching", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in and if you want some cartridges to refill yourself make sure you check this website out Bait part smart vpm comm very great place you guys have a good one that thanks for tuning in peace", "vM4mFkJN7kU": "[Music] hi guys I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're bringing you the latest addition to our honey stick 510 slim tank family which is our full ceramic honey stick tank now a lot of comments that I've gotten in the YouTube channel since we've started whenever we're launching cartridges and emails I've gotten from from you guys of viewers as well as my extraction clients and partners that we make cartridges for is they want something that is a hundred percent heavy metals safe state of California as they have cracked down on eliquids and a lot of other things because they are definitely ahead of the health curve and an innovator in the cannabis curve has outlined that certain cartridges once they've been prefilled have contained heavy metals and those may be harmful for you so they are still testing all of that and not all the research is in but a lot of companies and a lot of you guys out there like hey I want a cartridge that I make sure there's absolutely no heavy metals in it because I don't want to take the chance and rightfully so so we had cartridges made and brought in and they're now available on our website that passed the phase three heavy metals test of California before we even brought them in our manufacturers had already been working with with California we told them the designs we wanted and these came back and passed the test because they are 100% ceramic on the interior ceramic on the exterior they use a ceramic heater and do not use any heating components that will set off the heavy metals test and also they're the only ones that pass all those tests with flying colors and we can really sign off on and say it lives up to the honey stick performance now all of our other tanks we have sent over we are testing and we will get those published as the industry moves more towards that but we want to be ahead of the curve and make sure we offer something for you guys so this right here our full ceramic cartridge we have them available and are already private labeling these for a lot of our extraction partners and a half mil size so that's a half gram and also the 1 gram size which is the one milliliter capacity cartridge now these are gonna be full ceramic interior body if we can zoom in and get a nice close-up as you can see you have a full ceramic interior body center post bottom base medical grade silicone gaskets sealing the bottom pieces which the blocks are also made out of ceramic and it has a ceramic heater core power plant now you say oh you know that's all good and well it's safe but does it vape up the challenge and yes it does these things definitely do hit hard and they vape well and because of ceramic in tin internals they're gonna maintain a really nice flavor of purity for all you purists up there you're definitely gonna get more of those turf tastes out of here because it is not interacting with anything except for the pure coated thick grade ceramic now the heater actually people say okay what's the orifice hole size now this has a unique orifice hole and I'm not sure you can a hundred percent get this onto the camera from this angle but it is a dual two millimeter valack kind of a moon shaped heater absorption system so you're still get a lot of good absorption you're gonna get a nice vape cloud it's not gonna you know run into any bad situations when you're putting the thicker oils or CBD oils or distillates in there you know this cartridge is made to perform so you also have the medical grade silicone internals as I said to make sure this thing is sealed up and doesn't leak and you have the the full ceramic mouthpiece that is gonna feel nice on the lips and is also going to be sturdy as well as easy to clean now these are not one use tanks however they are disposable so you could get a handful refills out of them as long as your key easier gentle with them because they are ceramic you do have to be a little bit more gentle with them even though the glass is a high quality of Pyrex grade glass you do have to be gentle with them because the ceramic internals are not metal and they if you bend them or put a lot of pressure on them ceramic does have the tendency when you put unneeded pressure on them to break so be a little bit more delicate with these tanks however know that you are getting a good bang for your buck now how do you fill these up and what are some of the tips that that I can give you guys when you're when you're filling these tanks and using these tanks because they are relatively new and innovative so when you have these tanks there we're gonna send them to you partially opened right there to make it easy you're gonna remove the mouthpiece and as you're gonna see you have a threaded ceramic shaft along with the little silicone gaskets these are gonna help give you the seal so you're gonna have the top mouthpiece that's also gonna have a little gasket that's gonna be a glass sealer because these threads are ceramic if you put a lot of pressure on them and twist because the ceramic threads have to line up you're gonna strip the ceramic and it is then going to compromise it's not gonna you know particle eyes or anything like that but it's gonna wear down and you are not going to have a good seal and if you leave your tank on its side they're upside down once it's been filled you do run a higher chance of leaking and you're not gonna have you know the fully sealed air flow possibly that you want so it might affect your rips as well so this is just a caution point this is why we do the videos so when you're putting them together you're gonna fill around the outside edges around the center posts you're gonna fill up with your oils or concentrates your CBDs and then you're gonna take this top and you are going to gently apply pressure and it's going to kind of stop and then you're just gonna twist and give it a little bit of prep just very little pressure and it's gonna take a little bit longer and then you're gonna feel the thread catch and the rubber gasket the glass is going to compress and as soon you feel the rubber gasket compress against the glass then you're gonna know that you are all sealed up there you go boom nice and sealed I wasn't pushing it out enough buddy there you go now it's nice and sealed it's flush I felt it it came to a stop do not overtighten the tank otherwise you're gonna run the risk of stripping it that's why I twist a little bit more times because I didn't want to put too much pressure on it I gave it a little bitty push it was enough I gave a little bitty more push and the thread caught perfectly and now it is all lined up it is sealed and you are ready to vape just remove this end cap here screw this on to your favorite 510 thread battery and yes this does work with auto draws as you see the little air hole on there I don't know if you could zoom in to see the little air hole so it does work with auto draws screw it on to your favorite battery and give this thing a try so again if you're looking for a purist experience something that passes the latest legislation inspections in the California extraction

cheers guys", "OLBootSQ6z0": "hey guys I got a little bit of a leak you faucet as you can see see how that drip drip drip drip drip I have a little plastic deal here to kind of damper the drop because with the stainless steel sink hearing that over and over and over when it's real quiet the heat of heaters on right now so but it's one it's quiet and you're reading or talking or something this seems to magnify the sound so we kind of do this so it wasn't dripping that bad but it's continuous drip now so I'm going to try to attempt to take that cartridge out of here on the hot and the cold I tried to do it the other day so I could get it out without you know so I could take it to Home Depot or Lowe's to get a new one and I can get it out of there I did some research and Moen this is a Moen faucet so they have a little plastic tool for my research that are actually just a little plastic cap that goes on and you take a half inch wrench and work it back and forth like this to get it out so I thought well I researched to see which one I needed without 24 I believe I think anyway I'm going to get this out I had to get a different tool because the at home depot the cartridge that they sell then come with that little plastic deal Moen so I'm going to have to I bought a $12 or $14 tool Jimmy that out so that's what we're going to try to do now normally you would shut the water off underneath the sink but the hot and cold turn-offs I have there real little brass you know little valves that you turn but they're so small that they're stuck so they won't turn off so what I'm going to do is go outside this turn all the water off I walked around to the side of the house this is where your water shut-off is so pull this all the way this way I'll tie it sometimes that shuts it off so we could go back in and work on that water in there this shuts water off to the whole to the whole house okay now that we got the water shut off we could turn the water on a little bit we'll come out of the neck turn the hot and the cold I'll just run out of there Hey waters off completely these are completely on so we'll be able to work on that with so once you take this off now see there's a little caps on top sometimes you need a little screwdriver a little flathead but I took these off the other day so there and I just put it on that side so outside for that one and then I can take this off with my fear now see it's a little cap if it doesn't come off it's sometimes there on there pretty good you could use a little little small flathead screwdriver pry them off that one there and then there's just little Phillips I got a few tools here can screw this you'll see what I'm talking about here one screw is pretty easy now since I kind of muscle them out a couple days ago before I could get the parts cuz shut these off but then other places have the port so I went over to the west side and Adam so just a Philips screwdriver in there and then I just lay it on this side because that's where it goes on this side of the sink and see here's the the cartridge that's what I got to pull out of there I'm not sure what hot or cold or leaking but they recommend if you know ones leak and a change in both at the same time there's a little nut here that you have to screw off as well don't forget about that because you surely won't pull it out without taking that off put that over on that side to you so we know how it goes back together and then that's supposed to just pull right out real easy from my research people have gotten on top of the sink to try to pull it out pull their back out and I mean these are tough that's why Moen has a little plastic deal that fits on that you could kind of twist it and they say it comes with these but unfortunately then come with what the ones I bought so let me open this tool up here see if that might work well I pull that out I was in there pretty good this particular one doesn't have a clip has a little a a little indention right there that goes into here but there's no clip on these 12:24 and there's no plastic tool that fits on top so the instructions for this I couldn't hold the camera and do it at the same time but you pretty much let me see if I could get a tripod because it's pretty tricky dollar I think it was twelve or fourteen dollar tool did do the trick and I'll try to show you a little bit more on the other other side so but that's that's why they're so hard to get out look at how rested up that is and it's got two little rubber dowels on there those little that's probably what holds it sex it up t those little those are those are old they're shot you can see probably why it's leaked and I'm not sure which ones leakin but I'm going to replace them both so and then the challenge is opening up these but I'm going to cut them open of it I got those least I wasn't sure if I was going to have to buy a new faucet but I looked at my faucet and I paint over $200 for it so these at little cartridges are like 14 bucks apiece and this tool is about 12 bucks or 14 so it was about 40 45 bucks to get it to stop leaking which seems like yeah you could do it a little cheaper probably replace these rubber deals only and put this back in but you know which would be cheaper for you you know might stop the dripping but I'm going to go ahead and do these and see how that works out these are the tools actually I just use this this Phillips screw this in all the way down my channel locks here to turn this half turn and pull on it turn it a half a turn and pull on it and a little bit it was struggle a little tough but definitely this tool helped out so give it a try I'll see if I can detail out the next one a little bit better now here's a new cartridge that you put in and a lot of people have recommended that you get some of that it's for hot and cold water like a silicone not even it's like a grease I guess and the hot water hits it stays on but I notice when I open this it already has the grease on it this thing's pretty sticky right in kind of muscle it down Brawley muscles right in there so there's a little notch there make sure you get it down all the way what's that's in there pretty good so that's the new one so because then we got to put this back on a new one I don't seem to go down much apply I have to screw that down I'll go and tighter that's probably what Snug them down real tight and then why they're hard to get out of there so anyway this tool here you got to screw this all the way up as far as you can and then screw this top it's a Phillips screw to screw that all the way and then you put this on and it only go on really pretty much one way see how it kind of fits in there feels a little bit different than the other one let's try this way yeah that's about how it fits in there now remember these don't have a plastic tool that comes with these like they say in one of the other videos are the Moen website the twelve twenty-four so with this particular moment faucet you not get that little another little plastic tool just use this so then you screw this Phillips screw all the way down and this one seems to work this little screwdriver seemed to work better with this these both hands a whole mat on there they said just real snug you know you don't want to strip it and I find that pretty much goes all the way down to as far as it'll go so no chance it's dripping that and then just screw this big net all the way down like see how to do that squeeze all the way down not getting too close on this kind a tug screw it down with your hands as far as it'll go and there's no clip to take out here they also tell on the instructions which is real confusing that pull out a clip there's no clip on these some of them might have one so you might want to look for that so I just screw it down as tight as I can kind of pull on it and then it'll tell you to tighten it about half a turn open how to pull bit there channel locks a little bit of half a turn start trying to pull it out again this thing loosens up again do another half a turn take this screw the channel locks right half turn another half turn see how you got a muscle it out of there gimme it out of there not half turn another half turn see how that loosens up Thomas title with your here yeah see yeah that's tough who you really got to muscle that out but that's how it comes out where'd you have to put you half it they wanted to do it a half a turn and then Jimmy it out and then when this loosens up half a turn and Jimmy doubtless will loosen up again and half turn that way you know you don't break it I guess they don't want to put too much pressure that's what it looks like and that's how the Tool Works because reading the instructions on these 1224 s are pretty cuz they tell you to use that little plastic tool also and then how they tell you to do this it's can be confusing but hopefully this will seeing it in action shows you kind of how to do it but the tool I definitely needed the tool you could see how you muscle it out of there it's still hard you know I mean I'm breathing hard just trying to get this out so and then you just take the Phillips and unscrew that and you got the old one out that little clip goes so it just pushes in let's make sure that little notch is lined up there and then you just replace the brass little threads tighten those down okay just tighten these down just snug you know they'll turn a little bit because the new plastic ones aren't seated in there like they were but once you screw these down it pushes them down so just want to tighten them you know snug so if you ever have to do this again you can get them off again and put it up a little tricky I was thinking I put them on straight but maybe not I kind of turn around and see which one though go there all the way open see there you go so let me screw the Philips screws down those are easy enough put the caps on and turn the water back on okay let's do the Philips screwdriver I tighten that of the one type this one up this hold the handle and screw them down a little bit tough because they're brand new but that's good so that way your handle to be snug and let's get those it snug real tight go ahead and put your caps on those I'll just push down real easy that's the easy part taking these little caps off and put them on and that's good so we'll just turn the water on see how it works no case they come back out here and this is a lever we did to turn it off here go on let's do it real slow that totally on ok ok we're back inside and turn the water on little air in there pray that if I got to clean the little filters cuz when you turn the water off and on it's kind of dirty that's a hot turn it off takes a little while to shut off a little drip and looks like it worked anyway the annoying drip is fixed so that was a bit of a challenge that was my first my first kitchen faucet usually the kitchen faucets have been sold I replaced the whole thing so this is the first time I've replaced the cartridge let me show you this is the core polar that I used this one here and the instructions are for the 1220 if you can see that 1200 1222 1225 - a 1224 so it's a little bit different that these instructions can be quite confusing if you do have a 1224 so that's why I thought I'd do this video to help anybody out that has the same MO and sink that I have I hope this helps out that's my first kitchen faucet and I'm really I'm stoked about it because it's a it is not leaking if I have camera right here before you'd hear drip drip drip drip very successful it works and there's the phone so thanks for watching I hope this helps out", "Sgs9cbojCTI": "[Music] yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the rules kids bounce on up out of here and if you're new to the channel click that [ __ ] down below and subscribe today we do got a review it's a cartridge review it's coming to you by runts this is the obama runs i have i haven't never tried obama runs before not even the flower i seen this at burners in merced california it's a licensed cookies dispensary and i thought i would try out the runts uh cartridge this is only a half a gram it comes in the package like this let's pop it open it does got a little bit of headroom that you can see there i really don't like that uh it's got the seal on the top and the bottom let's get those off i got a fully charged battery here and on this it's weird the thc and everything the thc a is 10 and a half percent and then the d9 thc is 55 and a half percent and the cbd is at a point two percent so i don't it doesn't tell you the total on here it's kind of all over the place so we're just gonna try it out and see out see what it's like and i did do some research the obama runs is a indica dominant and this half a gram is gonna run you like like 45 bucks i think at uh burners in merced so cheers everybody let's get a hidden see what this shit's all about gotta turn it on oh and how they make uh obama runs is it's afghani crossed with og kush cheers yeah this is not live resin i want to say this is distillate as well it says on here to hit this one at uh low heat which is recommended 2 volts but this battery is the voltage is like you can change it and the lowest it goes is 3.3 so we have it at 3.3 off the first hit it's got a a good taste it's not fruity like they're adding [ __ ] to it it tastes like flour so i really like the taste and it was smooth we just got to see what the high is like because it feels a little light for me but you know we got to take a couple [Music] hits i do got a beer here i don't feel like doing the whole shoddy thing right now it's only uh [ __ ] 10 30 in the morning when i'm recording this so this is early beer and early filming for me i got things to do today 49ers play it one uh later on the lakers play so i got [ __ ] to do i gotta film early today okay off the first couple hits uh it's not bad at all this is all legit [ __ ] though it's got all the you know the seals and all the [ __ ] on it like it's all it's the real deal people i don't buy no fake [ __ ] okay so far i don't know i like an la cushion stuff this is okay but for the money that you're paying for it i don't know i might stick with the uh with the other ones that i've been smoking on this is probably more of like a cbd heavy or something cheers well it's not it's only a 0.2 but i don't know it's not like super strong on the on the thc this is one of those ones if you're a family function or maybe even at work and you still want to [ __ ] go throughout your day without being all [ __ ] up this one's probably perfect for you i think this is the first time i've ever bought a half gram too i usually go with the full grams but honestly it's not that bad it is it is pretty good i am starting to fill it now the more hits i'm taking but when you pay you know top dollar you want to feel that effect quick well i do anyway i've been smoking for a very long time my tolerance is extremely high so you guys need to remember that when you're watching my reviews my tolerance is [ __ ] high so if i'm giving some things like small like lower numbers on my reviews for some people that haven't been smoking that long it might hit you guys a lot [ __ ] harder you know so keep that in mind and the hot chip i am eating this uh i think i'm gonna eat it tomorrow i'm gonna film this tomorrow so you guys will be getting it in the next two or three days you guys will be getting that video somebody uh told me to do it live i thought about it but i think i'm just gonna go ahead and do it the same way i'll have the timer out and everything you know i've never done a live video before i don't feel like it's gonna pull in a lot of audience on my first one so i'll just stick to the video format let's get another hit in cheers hope you guys are smoking on something good having a great day this is sunday when i'm filming this you guys won't see it until [Music] monday morning yeah this one's on the lighter side i would like to try the weed the actual flower of obama runs and see if that's more of a you know if it's stronger if it has a hard punch to it or if it's mellow like the cart is so far and what i just did was i poked a hole in the back of this beer so it'll go down a little faster not like super fast but just gives it a little uh you know air ah okay let's get another hit in start calculating up the results here [Music] okay price this one this brand is pricey runs aren't cheap in any dispenser you go to it's a pricey brand you know it's well known it's one of your top of the lines it's up there with cookies and everything else so price it is pricey it's not your budget cart the the look of it uh it was a little low but it is only a half gram and it looks typical normal like every other cart that i've smoked on the uh the taste it tastes more like weed than it does anything else they like they didn't add any flavors to this or anything i can just taste more like weed like how the raw gardens uh ones taste the uh the smoothness is really good it doesn't you don't even feel the smoke going in or out at all and the high the high is mid mid range this isn't something that's going to put you on your ass at all it's more for someone that wants to function during the day still and and that's good for a lot of people a lot of people will like that you know me i just like to be stoned so um the functionable ones are always a little iffy for me that's why my reviews are a little lower on them you know so overall for the obama runs by runts vape cartridge i'm gonna have to give it the 7.8 because uh it's not it just don't get me high enough to get into the eights but the 7.8 it is real clean and it tastes really good and it's really smooth and i do feel the effects of it but i just want to be more higher when i smoke sorry so i'm giving it the 7.9 i mean 7.8 sorry not 7.9 7.8 some good stuff about it and some negative stuff about it i would say you have to try it out for yourself because not everybody's preferences are the same so i'm giving it the seven eight ah all right that was my review for the obama runs by runs hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town [Music] ah [Music]", "YpziYHdrR_w": "hey guys this definition we're reviewing arrow pros live resin series particularly this is wedding cake it's a hybrid coming in around seventy nine percent THC so this is the new thing from arrow Pro that they're doing live resin now all the carts before were just really distill it and I got to say I really like this the flavor is more cannabis oil type flavor it's not as you know flavored with different kinds of flavorings like mosteiro pros are and i like those flavors - I gotta say mountain mists which is a menthol kind of flavor I like it as long as the the carts are clean and it's done right I'm down the flavor carts I've had some that just weren't that strong like the rad vape but I've never had any AeroPro cart that was not strong so I really do like AeroPro and again this live resin something I like as well it's it seems like the oil is a little darker color than the distill it it does not have any like co2 which kind of taste it tastes like a good live resin so people that like that live resin taste and enjoy the Arab for hardware might like this instead of their regular cartridges I probably would still just be hitting both I think strength wise they're pretty comparable so this new method didn't really sacrifice any strength and I found that even arrow pros at like in the high 70s like I've had mountain mists at 78 be stronger than some of the other carts out there at you know in the low 90s so actually I would take I've had an arrow pros at 78 I would take over a Eureka I had at 96 percent THC which was still a Eureka was great but the arrow pros a little better and arrow Pro they've sold over three million cartridges and not had a single health complaint so everyone's worried about oh cartridges people getting sick you know that's all vitamin E acetate and cuts and stuff like that arrow pro is a multi-state company you know I they do have individual people that I think it do something with oil in different areas but it's all like a very high standard and that's why three million units sold and not a single health complaint so I know I mean who safety teas but I'll be hitting AeroPro for for a while so let's take a hit take a look it looks like you know I didn't take the fattest hit here's about what mm-hmm yeah you're a pro hardware it's basically a magnetized automatic magnet I see so with the vibrating function puts out a little more vapor than normal I like it and take another look at that resin and this also has been vaping pretty slow and hit this thing a lot and the oil Dave's pretty slow so AeroPro live resin you got to say overall two big thumbs up and I got to say I kind of expected that from AeroPro everything they've done has been super high quality the only issue they've had is they've had some batteries that have failed and I know there was a bad batch out there so you did have that the information is on our site on one of our prove ease we'll put it there to get that replaced but that's the only issue there I Pro has had and they warranty it so besides that I mean everything has been so great about it the product is excellent it hits well the live resin takes good so our po2 thumbs up this dab connection thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "dQO7oqdzNfA": "but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge what is going on you guys my name is Jeff also known as popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe I got a lot of lip videos on the way like today I'm gonna be showing you when I picked up from silver stem cannabis in my last video if you missed that video I got to tour their entire dispensary bring you guys with me show you what it's actually like inside of there it's [ __ ] sick make sure you check out that video a link to it will be in the description but right now I'm going to show you guys what I actually bought and what it looks like because there's some fire ass products there when you buy weed legally it comes with a receipt I spent two hundred and seventy seven dollars it would have been two twenty before tax but there's some hefty taxes in Colorado but it's worth it because hey I can [ __ ] buy the [ __ ] in the store I don't need to have a plug I don't need to fly with my own it's nice just being able to go into a store and pick out some [ __ ] and even with the tax it's so much cheaper than it is in Pennsylvania like you don't pay taxes when you buy weed in Pennsylvania but the growers and the processors and the stores are definitely paying a lot in taxes and that goes down to you so you might not pay a tax but you're being taxed alright let's start with these I picked up these little tablets just cuz I've never seen these before they're called pressies they have desired effects on them like sleep energy focus they only have like five or ten milligrams of THC in them so they're not very potent but they come with some other stuff that are supposed to actually help increase the desired effects that are labeled on the package I try out the focus ones just see what it's like it's literally like a little tablet and says a little THC mark on it's pretty cool I know if you're supposed to chew it or pop it I'm really glad I read that it says right on the bottom swallow don't you alright guys I'll see if that 10 miligrams does anything to me but I'm gonna be smoking a lot on top of it so I probably won't even really feel it you know I get high as [ __ ] all day and I get distracted so much stuff this could actually like help me focus real a little like that'd be kind of cool now let's get to the live rosin you guys picked up some olio I picked up the strain tropic sunset its a mix between slur Akane number 4 and papaya punch number 3 I didn't even smell it honestly like the name just sold me if you watched the video yesterday though you saw him open up a package of oleo they have such beautiful packaging man it's really [ __ ] cool they definitely take the extra step to make sure there's a great presentation with the product and the products really good so you really can't go wrong with them and just like the homie said it comes a little dab tool I didn't let it sit flat last night so you can see a little bit dripped onto the side but that's not the end of the world oh my god you guys this [ __ ] looks so good I was sure you're gonna close up for this if you guys can see that like it's just a beautiful yellow has a very nice consistency to it it's like a liquidy sugar and that's what's so cool about rosin man there's so many different consistencies that it ends up being just loaded up the puff coke peak I hope you guys are smoking with me let me know in the comments what you guys are smoking on every go you guys man I just like flew away and went to heaven that tastes so good [Music] my god you guys even when I look on this you guys truly [ __ ] beautiful job if you guys are ever in Colorado pick up some holy Arase Jim I really like this dispensary you guys they have some top-shelf concentrates there flowers amazing that's what I'm about to show you next but just like with over 300 dispensaries in Denver it's hard to find like all the good ones so as soon as you find one that has like great prices and great products like I just wanted to keep going to it damn I picked up two strains I picked up at indica and sativa flower this is the mimosa this is one of my favorite sativa strains I love smoking joints in mimosa if you've had mimosa before you already know but if you haven't you got to try it man it's some great [ __ ] weed and this is a shame that the budtender sold Deon he was very helpful this [ __ ] like I usually don't for whatever reason strains that have the word silver in it I don't like I don't even not like them I just like tend to just like not look at it because I'm like in my head I'm like gold is the best of silver my aunt but this is called silver OG and like I don't know if we get much better than this like it is a heavy indica it is like that deep green with like bright white trichome still so it looks like it has like snow on it this little it looks like the Tegrity farms Christmas snow weed and like if that was true that would be very concerning I don't know how good the shots do it for the weed but oh my god you guys it is a fire I honestly think I'm gonna go back to silver stuff before I go home and get some more flour because they had some great strains out there I just started with one indica and one sativa preheating the peak right now cheers you guys that was a nice reheat what I really like about the earrings is you can put a decent amount of wax in there and like if you take a big dab it's not all wasted like you can just reheat it and keep smoking it but this you guys is what I'm most excited to show you I've never had one of these before it's a rosin cartridge I paid too much money for this but I had to do it I said I wanted to try some cool cartridges while I was out here and I mean it happened this is from olio I don't want to skip over how great their packaging is they do such a good job on it that I feel like it deserves a little second I love you can kind of tell it has a little bit more of a foggy hue to it than a normal cartridge it's really cool how it says the strain on it too because sometimes you forget what strain you're smoking or if you have a lot of cartridges you can get them confused again using my cloud products rio+ different color but I just love these batteries they're one of my favorites cheers you guys wow that is one of the best AC cartridges I've ever had it's papaya punch that's gonna taste [ __ ] awesome but if being rosin versus actual distillate holy [ __ ] and like I can feel it like I'm getting really high off this like I can feel it on the face in the eyes this is not your normal cartridge this is crazy holy [ __ ] this is like one hit and you're high and it literally tastes like a rosin dab this isn't saying you guys the future man they can work on the price a little bit it would be way more feasible but what a great experience like I'm [ __ ] ripped I am so happy I got this this is the last thing we got through the liquid live resin cartridge I picked it off the name and the package honestly the [ __ ] is really cool and having a garlicy cartridge I've never had that before and it sounds pretty interesting chum the company Green Dot it's a [ __ ] [ __ ] to open here's the inside packaging cartridge is sitting on the side to push right through here to get the cartridge out then it gives you the stats on the back just peel here and don't use this if you're pregnant okay that this cartridge has a little adjustable air flow filter I don't really like these what it does is give you either more or less airflow I'd rather you just like tell me what's good and stick to it I'm gonna try minimal air flow and see how that goes Devlin gives you a hard hat doesn't Asus goes the rosin cart but still a good tasting cartridge well it's actually like kind of bad to the place garlicky it's not like sweet like that's why I prefer but it's like a very dank weed eat aced it's very heavy on the garlic I'll tell you that it's not even really a GMO taste it's definitely just more straight garlic it's a garlic explosion definitely prefer the rosin cart over this I'm going back to the rosin cart I need something with a better taste [Music] much better I think that's what we're gonna wrap the video you guys super pumped to try this for the first time way too expensive but definitely a cool experience that is so amazing this is probably the coolest thing I picked up in my opinion click like if you enjoyed the video let me know what you thought the coolest thing I got was subscribe for more videos I appreciate you watching my name is Jeff beaks", "BOUWQvtjvTs": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to weights the marijuana review show where we help you find folks make sense of your dispensary today we are taking a look at a cartridge here on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs", "oRA0I_MagQI": "what's up YouTube this is I start images back with another review this is another church cart so church cannabis company super premium cannabis distill it adjustable airflow cartridge advanced ceramic coil 510 thread eight watts max ultimate damping experience this one is melon aid it's a sativa has seventy one point four THC and their stickers are so like blurry sorry for the steering wheel part here I didn't realize it was in the video but as I said before these don't fit on my palm battery on my claw or anything like that so I've got a normal stick battery that uses iPhone and Cecil iPhone C cell and Android I believe so church cart melon aid I'm just going to get right into this hopefully everyone had a great Monday everyone enjoyed the day four before all the rain hit it's raining again now come on so slides got locking mechanisms on it but yeah we uh pretty much finished our work day before the rain kicked in so and then came home and hung out with my son and my girl for a little bit and now now we're gonna do review I know that doesn't really because I not have a white background um as I said before on the last one I did these carts seem pretty solid reusable the top looks like it just twists off the airflow piece as I said there's like three little dots inside but uh we're just gonna get right into it see what this one's about the other church is pretty good I I don't even remember the flavor of that one I haven't touched it since I did the review so it's just sitting in a box because I've always got my palm battery like even right now let me reach in my pocket I've got my Platinum vape galactic Jack on my palm battery so break out the stick battery so that I can use this because as I said it doesn't fit on the palm it's probably not going to fit on the curve pretty sure it's not going to fit some of the hives and the Hades battery that I had this one looks like it's got a scrape on it or it's cracked one of the two possibly a small little crack you probably can't see it because my phone's not gonna focus but it doesn't seem like any liquids leaking out doesn't seem like there's a lot of residue or anything on the side of the cart so definitely get the melon tastes kind of sweet say like uh almost like the watermelon hubba bubba kind of tastes like that I'm not getting a lemonade as much I don't know if this batteries dying no [ __ ] every time I breathe out my nose I sneeze from these things tasty I'm picking these off her I think 45 apiece I'm not exactly sure what they're being sold for it a lot of the other places the guys telling me 50 60 bucks I didn't do any research on it yet but I will but until I can you know make the drive down to it to a dispensary or one of my friends houses so that they can run for me pretty much I'm just at the mercy of you know the dude I go through but he's been getting pretty damn good [ __ ] so I can't really complain yeah pretty good pretty good pretty good very tasty this one's actually a pretty good taste probably got to charge the battery so I can get big big hits but yeah if any of you like Church comment below with what flavors that you want to see me try to review pretty much any of that stuff any other car brands like I still got to get my hands on the Select do a couple reviews on that I still want to try those Rove ones but I still think they're only out in California at the moment I'm not really gonna do any reviews on dang tapes right now just I've had three good and three bed so I'm 50/50 at the moment but you know the only thing I ever really hear about this company now is it there isn't really a company it's just people buying the [ __ ] online and making their own stuff and selling it whether that's true or not I don't know that's just [ __ ] I heard I haven't really heard anything bad about any of these church carts yet other than maybe price but as I said you're paying for this big monstrous cart like I mean it's rugged it's heavy compared to it's heavier than this whole entire battery this little thing is heavier than this these are this is a little bit heavier than just the car other than that the next one will be a review on another north extracts a guy told me about them you know basically told me to go check out some other stuff cleaner products all that kind of stuff so I appreciate his comment and I mentioned it in one of my last videos I don't know if I posted it yet but this one is uh max 69 one gram but I'll get into all of that in the actual video but as I said hopefully you guys all had a great day today at a fun relaxing weekend with family girlfriend whoever hopefully you smoked down on some good [ __ ] and just enjoying life pretty much seems all work no play these days you know I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that it seems I could just work in work to pay bills and you don't really get to go out and do much just on the money cuz bills just eat eat that [ __ ] especially if you got kids but uh yeah if you guys don't line smash that subscribe button hit the like button comment below if you've had these Church or any of you have tried this one let's talk about it if there's some other flavors in this specific brains you would like me to try I'm open to try pretty much any one of them but yeah I'm probably going to end up be selling these most likely to my brother nothing nothing against them I just I enjoy what I have so when I have a family member or a friend or someone said that they want some the ones that are just sitting in a box doing nothing are the ones I'm gonna sell it's not that this is a bad flavor it's not like the other one was a bad flavor I just overall prefer a lot of the newer plant invades some of the Midnight Express flavors but that's just personal opinion at the moment there's just so much out there to try for me to me you know just general statement the ones that I like at the moment but yeah I also really like flavor XO eventually I'm gonna get my hands on some more of those and review some of those for you guys especially since they got the new packaging the new flavors that kind of stuff but as I said you guys have a great night take it easy I appreciate you guys watching to all the new subscribers whether you're watching my weed videos or my my rap reactions or music reactions or not I just appreciate you all you know thank you very much for your time out of your busy days and anyone that's sobbing hey you're a big help it only takes one thing to do that whether you watch my videos or not subbing is good obviously I need the views and all that too but kind of start someone so appreciate you guys other than that you guys have a great day peace out", "TRE1KhNV06s": "hold on guys it's angel from discount vape pen today we're going to be taking a look at the card is in black box this is going to be a vape for your cartridge 510 cartridges we're going to go up close and show you what you get in the box [Music] alright guys up close we're gonna open up the Cardassian black box show you what comes inside up top you're gonna have a little card which is pretty much going to give you all of the functions of it and talk a little bit about it very intuitive it's going to show you exactly what you need to get started using it also gonna have the black box itself really nice really nicely made this box here I'm going to show you a little bit around it got your charge port on the bottom there you're also gonna have your three lights for your battery life your button up here three clips is gonna shoot your due to different voltages and then like I said just using it cartridge in here just to show you guys see there your battery indicator on the bottom which is nice for a concealed unit like this because most of them don't have that as you can see this is a 1 mil cartridge with a small magnet that's perfectly in there and as you can see that opening is huge so it's gonna fit some of the bigger 510 cartridges out on the market show you everything else you get get a nice little goodie bag here it's gonna have your basic USB charger you're gonna have a small magnet for 1 mil cartridges and you're gonna have a bigger magnet for your point 5 cartridges which would just allow the cartridge itself to sit a little bit higher so as I said this is the smaller magnet and the bigger one is gonna be for your shorter cartridges that way when you drop it in this part right here will stick out enough to where it's actually functional nice little juice window there on the side so you could see what's in the cartridge and overall just a nice little solid construction of the device this does have a 900 mAh battery so one of the biggest batteries for a concealed unit like this the 3 settings it's gonna start at 3 point 4 volts go to 3.7 and then it's gonna go to 4.0 on the highest setting and then as I said before probably one of the bigger batteries and it does have that indicator which is nice on the bottom and that's our first look at the car tusen black box alright guys so that was our first look at the carson black box as you can see the features just make it overall a really good device to use for your 5-10 cartridges right now I just have a cartridge in here I'm gonna show you how it functions right now it's on the blue setting which is the medium so as you can see it functions just like a regular 510 cartridge battery but it does have its benefits the adjustable settings on there the battery life on this thing is amazing as I said before it's gonna take any cartridge on the market as you can see that huge opening in there and you're gonna be able to fit some of the wider longer cartridges in there and then the fact that it does come with the two magnets doesn't matter if it's a 0.5 or a 1 mil it's gonna fit in there no problem nice button the settings are easy to navigate and overall just a really nice solid 510 cartridge battery then take another little vape on it here so as you can see it does exactly what it's supposed to just gives you a little bit more option if you guys are using some of the bigger 510 cartridges they're gonna slide in there no problem and this is gonna work for you and again this is probably one of the bigger per concealed unit this is gonna be one of the bigger batteries to get on the market sir less charging you're gonna be able to go most of the day with it without having to charge it overall just a really nice box guys if you like we just saw in the video is give us a thumbs up it's a subscribe button if you're interested in a Carter's and black box they're available for purchase at discountjuicers.com [Music]

someone watch the video I posted before this one go ahead and check it out we'd really appreciate that but other than that it's Sunday more Sunday morning actually you know I'm just chillin kicking back bout it hit my dispensary maybe a cup and eight this something you know it's it's about that time you know I really want to smoke it it's kind of different when you have a when you smoke out of a cartridge and you smoke a bloody nut I mean it's way different so but before I go ahead head out you know I want to get this out of the way so here we have this lemon haze from bloom farms you know I've never had a blue farm before actually I have but it was more uh it was one of these darts I'm know if you guys had seen these before these are pretty good so I don't know if they taste exactly like the card just because at the time I didn't see no cartridges I just seen these so I don't know whether they just like I said they just came out with cartridges or whatnot but you guys let me know on that this was like it was like 38 bucks you know I couldn't pass these up they had a lot they had all kinds of flavors you know what I mean so there's those people say there's a lot of fakes and there's real [ __ ] but you know this one's definitely real I got it from the dispensary but I don't know what would be the difference between a fake or real so I cannot tell you like you know on the packaging is [ __ ] so let me know in a comment section what are you guys smoking on I'm about to pop this [ __ ] open you know I have a smoked all day so it's about that time we get the wake-and-bake going so let's go ahead and pop this [ __ ] open so the THC on this is 83 no 88 actually total cannabinoids I got to see on the back and it's pretty cool pretty cool simple packaging so we're just gonna go and take this little alright guys so we finally got the sticker open and I kind of [ __ ] it up you know kind of [ __ ] the box up a little tab ripped out so here it goes hey they got the here you got the the packaging and it looks pretty dope you not never had a bloom cartridge before and here it says today was a good day it's pretty dope packaging I'm starting to really like this we're gonna get that and all you get is like this little I'm hotter burnin like what what not to do you know what your cartridge which I'm pretty sure are you cartridge smokers know what and what not to do what your cartridge is right keep it out of the keep out of the Sun you know what that should amount and [ __ ] so here you have it cool little cab a little oh [ __ ] alright guys so we finally you have to push this and you turn it at the same time so it's kind of where you know you you gotta know what the [ __ ] you're doing with these things because it's not gonna have a hard time trying to open this [ __ ] so BAM guys this looks pretty nice you know the oil looks really really clear nice yellow gold and first of all we're just gonna go ahead and do the bubble test on it this one's a super Lemon Haze I were really big the team fan and the super Lemon Haze is like a really old school strain so I really caught my attention so that's why I kind of wanted to get it the oil is really really thick guys she does not move at all so it's it's not life resin it says triple distillate so it must be some pretty you know clean clean distillate some people say dis list not to move now you know a lot of resins a new wave well it kind of is you know there's a lot of companies coming out with live resin so I don't know I mean this still is still good you know don't get me wrong it's still good just depends what kind of distillate you guys get from so we're gonna try hit this and we're gonna see what it tastes like all right off the bat you can taste those lemons man it is really good wow that's just fire I didn't just let me give you guys a little close-up again before I smoked a [ __ ] out of this cartridge it says bloom on there and this is the SL H for super Lemon Haze on the side and you got your California sticker there which is pretty dub so we headed up connected the little magnet right here for the yoke and battery you guys need to get one of these joke cows and other monsters had it for like almost two years already you know it's still hits like if I just pull it out the Box you know so we're just gonna throw it in there and cheers guys if you got smoke along with me go ahead and do so man we're about a good fake right now Wow I'm gonna be honest with you guys this cartridge does not taste like distillate it tastes more like a it tastes like really cleaned lemons no fresh like it's just fire its [ __ ] guys I didn't really expect it to be that good you know for some distillate bloom bloom Farms are pretty far man I'm going to hit her again I'm see if I can get a bigger bigger cloud oh yeah definitely you get lemons you know Wow so if you guys you guys let me know like what's the price on these bloom cartridges some people told me to have fakes you know so I don't know whether what to tell the difference like I said but you guys have these around where you guys from what's the price on these I got him prepared for like $38 with tax so it's not as bad so you guys don't pass this up man I'm at the [ __ ] again she's pretty good you know it tastes like actual lemons like it'll taste fake or nothing like that tastes like some actual terpene and definitely one of my favorite cartridges so far from bloom farm I haven't tried I haven't tried any other ones besides this one and the GDP one the GDP one was really good as well you know it tastes like actual granddaddy but but this was pretty far guys and if you guys ever see this super Lemon Haze you guys gotta try them out you know for the price $38 well it depends on where you guys from but here where I'm from it's pretty cheating but this is California but yeah guys I'm uh gonna head out good like I said I'm go to my dispensary and picked up some weed and tied to a hot box video or something let me know in the comment section what kind of cartridges and what kind of videos you guys like to see that I mean cuz I do what you guys want to see but you guys just gotta let me know in the comment section and really appreciate you guys watching my videos and don't forget to add the snapchat and just hit me up you know you guys have any questions and you guys have a really good day and you guys stay safe my peace", "6MO-ZGV-BUM": "i'm like yo there's some pink puffy [ __ ] i mean hello kitty posters and [Music] chocolates [Music] all right guys what is up simplistic here back with another video i am at ben's house once again and uh if you've been seeing this tronium battery around it's because it's been dope but they also gave me a box one too so i'm gonna see what this is and then i'm gonna probably give this little small one to ben and then i'm saying the small hand for the band no i'm just kidding um but yes this is the box battery it's like a box mod type [ __ ] and uh they're kind enough to send me one so let's see how this works oh yeah shout out to the mahomey van for always being dope you know saying but this is what it looks like uh the back draw activation so there's no button 380 milliamp per hour battery micro usb compatible with troy pods which is the the cartridges the empty cartridges that they provide one year warranty so there you go right off the bat very very nice um [Music] i was about to say that's it it's supposed to there's a quick start manual [Applause] micro usb adapter which they offer for the the small one and the long ones so this one you use for full grain this one for a half gram manual also a qr code if you want to scan it well let's just get into it we got that nine dollar half grand papa herbs look how much i have left because i went live again last night shout out to the people you know what i'm saying oh nice so it's auto hit so how do you turn this on and off it's weird oh it hits it's actually a lot smaller than i thought it was going to be oh wow definitely start the day with this there's no button just hit it there's no indication here that's pretty cool like you like it has these like uh where you can see the oil yeah yeah you just you just hit it it's actually really smooth compared to the other battery this one there's no voltage setting though so uh it kind of just maybe it's like a smart battery i don't [ __ ] know maybe i adjust to the the cartridge how smooth is it is it cool i like i like the way it feels too how it's like uh it's got like this little the form factor right and that's his thumb yes yeah also um like i said the drawback with these ones how'd you like it it's cool so these are basically the drawback of having a stick battery is that if you put in your pocket it could break you know what i'm saying if you sit down if you just like put in here you know sometimes you just put a pencil in your pocket and sit around with it you know some tight pants or some [ __ ] you know so it does happen um micro usb on the bottom uh i thought it would be usbc by now but you know i'm saying you can't really go wrong with micro usb it still charges pretty fast 380 milliamp per hour battery um other than that i'm taking more uh like a few more hits with this uh i'm enjoying it um maybe i should take a hit alongside with this one to see how smooth it is compared but is there any light that indicates like it's i think it's right here can you see no no light there's no manual there is many oh what the [ __ ] what it's right here see if you can see the light oh yeah okay so the light is right here so you can so like i said uh they did send me two batteries the stick battery and the pocket battery and honestly i'm i'm digging this one uh the light is i mean it's kind of visible in the in sunlight but overall really really good experience and i'm saying it's basically the height of this one still you know i'm saying so but check them out i'll post everything in the comments below you know i'm saying i'll pin a comment because i've been getting you know deleted because i've been posting links and strikes and stuff so i'd rather just post it in the comments you'll that's where you'll find it but definitely a good battery from um i'm saying other otherwise known as t-vape as well so thank you for watching the video see you guys the next one [Music] he [Music]", "lRey3-ePnD8": "- Hi, I'm Jay Cohen from Blass Law, and we're here to talk\nabout vape pens with THC. Previously, we talked about\nhow any amount of THC oil is a felony in Texas. No one wants to be charged with a felony. Some things that you need to remember if you are approached by the police with a vape pen is\ndon't admit to anything, don't lie, and exercise your rights. What are those rights? You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to\nhave a lawyer present, you have the right to\nnot incriminate yourself. We recently had a defendant\nwho was approached by police with a vape pen. Asked, \"What is it?\" \"Well, it's a vape pen.\" \"Is it THC?\" \"Yeah, it's THC.\" \"Where'd you get it?\" Said exactly where she got it. What did that person do wrong? Well, they admitted, they\ndidn't exercise their rights. Lies weren't really an issue there, not that they could prove. That's the wrong thing to do. Another example. Officers approached the defendant. They say, \"Is that a vape pen?\" He said, \"Call my lawyer.\" They said, \"What do you\nmean, call your lawyer? You don't have a right\nto a lawyer right now.\" Said, \"I'm not saying anything. Call my lawyer.\" Well, you know what? That was the right thing to do. Because that person\ndidn't admit to anything, didn't have to lie, and\nexercised their rights. So if you get caught with a vape pen, exercise your rights, tell\nthem to call your lawyer, and then call Blass Law.", "A2k1Q7rTNJg": "hey everybody its cannon Joe we are checking in today at Stinson Beach California one of our last days out in California and today we are very excited to review a Willys reserve distillate cartridge this is Mountain mist this is the flavor and we were super lucky enough to be introduced to a woman that basically gave us these and donated these products here to us from Flo Canada and we are very very excited to try this Willy's reserve as a Willie Nelson brand and of course everybody hears about that and they want to try it out and here today we are about to so let's just go ahead and get in on it so we've got our warnings of course this is awesome packaging I really like it local farmers you can check it out online recyclable packaging that's cool yeah this is nice packaging everything's nice I like the colors really stands out they did a good job they're got Willie Nelson in the background right there that's cool 81 percent THC again this is a distillate and then you've got 0.33% of CBD so oh I like that big packaging there I've never seen one like this now okay but you take that out like that wow this is this is a heavy-duty case right here [Music] okay that was an extremely long horn blow again we are at a beach so it's probably the get in or get out of the water call so here we go this cartridge is very high-quality we've got like a stainless steel feel here on the mouth tip it's a very large hole this is uh it's heavy too it's got the WR right there on the right there on the logo and so we're gonna just go ahead and try it out here see what happens okay here we go mmm that's good lemony hmm Wow mmm that's got everything you're looking for I mean it's got the Terp tic it's got the back of the throat choke it's got the whole tickle in the nose it's got pretty much everything but it's not bad in any way shape or form because a lot of the times that all those things can go into a bad you know they can be too much term tech too much choke throughout all them things that you don't want but this is pretty much all that you do let's try this again just get one more try see what really happens excuse me I didn't expect that okay who's that my friends excuse me all right so you want to be careful with this this is no joke this is not a joke this is the lowest temp a lot of times with your vape pens you know you can take the whole hit sometimes maybe even two you can time out the pin to really get the flavor saver going but this one here no this is a one I mean you can barely get through one time out with this and yeah I feel I feel a little on the road again so yeah I definitely appreciate this this is an awesome pin I give it pretty much a 10 let's give it a 10", "F4LeAVpTdds": "in this video I'm going to show you how to repair a leaky faucet in your kitchen it is super easy it's important that you repair your leaky faucet because if you don't it could cost you a lot of money in fact I was looking at a study here that says that a simple small teeny leak could cost you $20 a year and if you have a more significant leak it could leak 30 to hundreds of gallons of wasted water per day and could cost you a couple hundred dollars per year also if you follow these steps and repair your leaky faucet you won't have to buy a new faucet which could cost anywhere from like forty to two hundred dollars if you're here for the first time you should subscribe I do lots of DIY home improvement home renovation videos for doing this repair you'll need some pliers you'll also need a little hex wrench thing to loosen the screw here or you might need a Phillips screwdriver depending on what kind of handle you have on your faucet first step is you need to turn off your water so underneath your sink there should be little water turn offs for your hot and cold water so I'm gonna come them down here and it should look something like this so here is our warm water so they're gonna go like this and then turn it off there we go you can hear that stopped the the leaking water from the faucet so now it's not dripping I actually don't even have to turn off my cold water so I'm just gonna leave my cold water on so I turned off my suspicious hot water so you can see it's not turning on when I turn this the next step is I am going to unscrew it right here there's a little hex wrench screw thing so I'm gonna unscrew that with this kind of a wrench right here and take this guy off so when it pops off you gotta be very careful you don't lose this piece so I'm going to go in put it in this little pipe in pop this off put that in the pie tin as well when you take this off it's actually you might consider cleaning if you have any hard water deposits I actually just did that just barely you can take some some vinegar and get it wet and then get a sponge and then just kind of scrape off this hard water deposit anyway it makes it look brand-new it's real nice after taking off the hard water deposits like this nut you can see is actually a little bit loose right here so before you go ahead and replace this cartridge if it's a good cartridge you might just need to tighten this nut so righty tighty so we're gonna try that okay so now that this is tight it hopefully won't leak any more but if it does leak after you tighten this then what you want to do is unscrew this and you'll want to unscrew this and replace this cartridge so you should be able to buy you know this new cartridge at Home Depot or Menards or Lowe's a home improvement store like that but I'm going to try it without replacing this cartridge so I put this back in here and I'm going to tighten it up and hope that will work [Music] let's see if it works so before I screw this back on I'm going to go ahead and it's kind of a weird angle now so I just loosen this nut and since it wasn't quite straight I kind of moved it to where it was straight so you move it like that when it's loose and then you can go ahead and tighten this okay let's give that a try I'm not going to screw it on yet I'm just gonna give it a test so let's go back underneath for that turn back on the warm water okay so far so good I don't see any leaking water now let's try turning it on oh look at that guys think we have fixed our leaky kitchen faucet now I'm going to secure this handle back on it I'm gonna put down the towel here this time so that way if the screw thing falls down and won't go down the drain alright guys so that's

through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the description make sure to share the social media do all that [ __ ] like the video comment a subscribe do all that [ __ ] I'll see you in the next video we're just gonna be on I'll see you in the next video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "_Zl3JFrkz2Q": "[Music] hi my name is Peter I'm with air vapor systems and we help businesses select source fill and ultimately find packaging for plant-based essential oil vaporizer pans so today we're gonna address a question that has been coming up for one of our new product lines what is C cell C cell very simply put is probably one of the most disruptive technologies to hit the vaporizer pen space in quite a while what C cell is is actually ceramic coil technology it is based around a ceramic coil that has been specially designed to absorb and vaporize plant-based essential oils at a high rate producing large clouds of vapor a lot of flavor and a really intensified user experience now how does C cell do this how does what makes C cells so special makes it so important and how exactly does it accomplish this kind of disruptive performance well C cell has a ceramic corn rather than a fabric wick based core what that means is that it's able to vaporize much higher viscosity essential oils without any problems and what it does is it pairs this coil with a high performance battery this is a high discharge lithium-ion battery that allows the coil to heat up quicker then most other coils do thus producing much bigger clouds of vapor upon exhale what this does is this provides two huge benefits for businesses who are looking to engage the C cell platform for their own use number one it provides a very standout user experience meaning that when you place your essential oils into a C cell your users are gonna notice they're gonna notice that the vapor clouds that they're producing are much bigger the hits they're taking is much bigger and to follow on the heels of that the second huge benefit for businesses looking to engage the C cell platform is the rate of consumption of the oil meaning that once you put your oil into a C cell cartridge it's gonna get consumed by the user at one point five to two times quicker than in a normal vaporizer pen this is because C cell has designed their entire pen for optimum performance I really like to compare C cell to a Ferrari and most other normal vaporizer pens to a Honda there's nothing wrong with a Honda I have a Honda love Honda but Honda is meant to be efficient and it's meant to be friendly to the normal everyday consumer but if you're looking for performance if you're looking for really high performance you're not gonna buy a Honda you're more than likely gonna buy a Ferrari right if you have the money for it Wow what makes a Ferrari special well a Ferrari is built from the ground up to be for for performance right everything from the tires to the suspension to the chassis to even the seat that the driver sits in is all made for performance that is what makes C self special everything on the C cell platform is designed for performance it basically allows you to vaporize your oils evenly without burning them while also pairing that with a high discharged battery that delivers more power thus allowing you to have larger hits so C cell from the ground up is designed for performance in a way that normal vaporizer pens cannot match so let's begin by taking a look at the entire C cell lineup before we drill down into the individual components of this lineup so that you as a user or as a brand are familiar with the C cell platform as you engage in it now it's worth noting that C cell likes to keep its lineup very sleek and minimalist there's only about five different C sell products however with a combination of different material finishes as well as branding options there's really a lot of ways that you can begin to express your brand through C cell now to start here on the cartridge side of things Cecil offers two different cartridges their first cartridge is called the th2 cartridge it is we refer to it internally as the c2 cartridge so when you call us and ask for this cartridge you can refer to it as either the th 2 or the C 2 cartridge however it is a glass cartridge with a ceramic tip onto it and this is really CISOs flagship cartridge when the user puts their lip on the their lips on the ceramic tip they instantly notice the quality and how this is a much heavier as well as better built cartridge than they may have be used to engaging with and what it does is it really makes any plant-based essential oil that's placed into this cartridge stand out from the pack now if you want to have that same sort of performance in a more cost effective packaging Cecil offer also offers the m60 which we refer to internally as the c6 but also available in a half gram as well as a 1 gram size but the entire body is made of plastic so that is a plastic body as well as a plastic mouthpiece even though this provides a slower price you still get a hundred percent of the performance because it has the patented C sell coil technology on the inside so there is no difference in performance between the glass cartridge or the plastic cartridge just a difference in material finish as well as cost now let's move on to the batteries very quickly you have two types of batteries for C so both of which are Auto and Hale batteries it means that they are not button activated see cell likes to have a user interface again very Apple like that is very easy to use and easy for a customer to learn to you so with both of these batteries once you put your cartridge on it you simply inhale in it that battery will automatically activate now first is the m3 battery which we refer to as just the C cell battery internally when you take this battery and you connect it to AC cell cartridge you end up with a very ecig like appearance that allows for a lot of description of discretion without any loss in performance this is a 350 mAh battery which means that it will last the typical user about a week before they have to recharge it now the newest battery to the C cell lineup is actually the palm battery here and this is a very interesting battery this actually has a drop-in design with a magnetic connector which means that you can drop in your cartridge and it won't fall out even though you don't have to screw anything in it allows the user to then also place it in the palm of their hand for maximum discretion while they're using it so that no one can see really what they're inhaling and this is a great option if you are really trying to express maximum discretion through your brand or for your users now lastly here we have the C cell disposable pen this is really the penultimate in terms of ease of use there's nothing to recharge there's nothing to refill you simply place your oil inside this disposable pen use it until it doesn't work anymore and then you throw it away and buy another so if either you as a user or as a brand you're choosing to engage this platform just know that if you really want to be able to convert users or provide an experience that it's extremely easy the disposal pen is the way to go because there's just no it's it's basically a proof there's no way to mess this up there's no way to not recharge it correctly or not fill it correctly so that is the entire C cell lineup let's drill down into each of these products individually so that you can learn a little bit more about the finishing and custom branding options available [Music] you", "hxxVrOv-v1I": "stop buying fake vape carts off the street because you know what you are smoking chemicals and i'm going to show you the chemicals you're smoking and it's not going to be nice you're going to feel disgusted and unfortunately that's what people do when they live in illegal states where marijuana is not legal but i'm going to give you a solution so if you live in a state where marijuana and thc vapes are not legal i'm going to show you how you can get it anywhere in the country online shipped right to your door but anyways my name's chris i'm with cbd and thc extract.co and i've been in the cannabis industry for 10 years and hemp specifically for three years and by the way if you haven't tried our hemp flour yet hit the link in the description below and you can get an eighth of our flour completely for free doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link below to claim the offer but anyways if you've been on the street you know that these glow carts and supreme cards and all these different carts are all over the place and even in illinois where weed is legal people are buying these illegal street brands literally because it's cheaper than the dispensary that's kind of sad but unfortunately there's a lot of price gouging in illinois but anyways i digress these carts actually have lead and ethyl acetate in them specifically glow carts so if you look at the lab test i'm going to pop it up on the screen right now what you're going to see in these lab tests is that there's trace amounts of lead probably in the hardware itself right heavy metals and you can see that there's ethyl acetate as well who knows if they're using it as a cutting agent or maybe it's part of the hardware as well but ethyl acetate is basically a derivative of glue um yeah you don't want to be smoking glue i mean do you want to be vaping glue do you want to inhale heavy metals because i don't know if you remember the vape epidemic that went on and i think it was 2019 about last year and kids were getting sick from vape sucks that it was kids really they should have been adults but um supposedly the theory is is that these kids were smoking vape cartridges that were basically street carts right and these street carts what they had in them is the lead or heavy metals or cutting agents and specifically with the lead obviously is very toxic that's why they took it out the pencils in school now they use graphite um because it was literally kids were dying same thing with the vape ironically and basically they were vaping oil all the way down to the bottom of the cart and when they vaped it to the bottom of the cart they started to burn the wick and the heating element and when they burned that heating element not only were they burning the heating element but they were inhaling the toxic lead that was contained in that heating element and come on really do you want to save a couple bucks and inhale chemicals i mean do you want to end up like those kids in the hospital literally last year and even with covet going on i mean health is everyone's number one priority right now i think everyone's has that priority and here's the funny thing glow cart's the company they try to act all transparent like oh we got these uh little qr codes where you can verify it's real that doesn't mean anything because you can go to dhgate.com and buy the packaging and you could buy the empty carts by yourself for dirt cheap so and the thing is even if you get the real glow carts the real ones from glow carts whatever that is whatever that entity is it's it's funny because the lab test that they posted shows the lead and it shows the ethyl acetate in the product maybe they thought just because they have a lab test that it's okay and it's totally safe maybe they don't even know how to read a laptop and obviously no one else does because no one looks into the stuff they just see oh thc vape let me smoke that or let me vape that they don't really look into the details they don't think what kind of vape cartridge is it what kind of is it distillate oils they're cutting agents right what kind of turps are they using they don't look into any of this stuff they just see oh like that looks cool cool packaging bro it's cheaper than the dispensary or i can't get it anywhere else that's just really sad you don't want to end up in the hospital but anyways if you want a solution what i'm going to tell you is there's a new product that's out on the market it's taking the hemp market by storm it's pretty crazy it's called delta 8 thc and basically because of the 2018 farm bill that the president signed basically what it did is it legalized hemp derived compounds for example delta 8 thc can be derived from hemp so basically if you get thc and extracted from hemp now it's legal federally which means you can buy it online and you can get it shipped to your door so what you can do is you can go online right now and type in delta 8 thc cartridge and buy thc right now and the thing that's great about it is that if you're 18 that's fine because most dispensaries are 21 and up for hemp the federal law is that it's only 18. 18 plus watch out there but anyways it's only 18 plus and it's cheaper than the dispenser at least here in illinois the cartridges at the dispensary like 72 bucks for half a gram for a cart where a delta 8 cartridge online is you know anywhere from 50 60 bucks and it gets shipped to your door that's before discounts and whatnot so point is if you want to buy delta a thc and protect your health and stay away from the dirty street vendors that are putting cutting agents and chemicals in your products that you're inhaling into your lungs i'm going to leave a link down below where you can buy delta a thc a couple of vendors you can get your hands on it and try it out for yourself it's just like the delta nine only it's delta eight has a double bond instead of a single bond on a molecular level i'm not a chemist or anything but i know that much so i hope you enjoy that information about why you should never ever smoke vape carts off the street ever again because it's really just disgusting so if you like content like this leave a comment let me know what you think but thanks have a great day", "M3LXZqjVxgA": "what's up everybody this is frank with dime industries today i want to talk to you about an issue that we all have in the industry and that's fake products i want to show you some of the things to look out for and how to stay healthy while enjoying your dining here i have a real dime product and a counterfeit time product i'm gonna go over some of the packaging features that you guys need to look out for so you can stay safe you can see that the colors completely off on our actual product we have a high gloss high resolution finish on the counterfeit product is a low resolution no gloss on here the authentic product has gigu stamped at the very bottom of the actual packaging which is our manufacturing partner counterfeit products do not you will also notice that counterfeit products will not come with a validation sticker every single authentic dime product has a validation sticker that has an individual validation code that you can only validate at dimeindustries.com now i'm going to compare authentic hardware with counterfeit hardware and what you need to look out for let's take these out of the packaging [Music] now let's take the hardware out of the packaging the first thing you're going to notice is that authentic dime products will always prompt you to validate your product once you open it you're going to see information that leads you to the validation program that we have on our website the first thing you're going to notice is that the mouthpiece on the counterfeit product is much longer than the mouthpiece on our authentic dime product second of all there's no california symbol etched on the actual tank another point that you'll see is that the atomizer is much smaller than our no waste atomizer you'll see that the holes the collection holes are actually fully exposed in the counterfeit product and in our authentic dime product they'll always be recessed into the actual atomizer just make sure that you're able to collect all your oil and you smoked every single last drop on the counterfeit hardware you'll notice that you can twist off the top [Music] authentic dime tanks have pressed on caps that you're unable to remove if you're able to remove them that means you probably broke your tank on the bottom of every single authentic dime tank we stamp our logo and our manufacturer's logo as you can clearly see the counterfeit hardware has no stamp at the bottom counterfeiters don't care about your health and safety all they care about is their bottom line in the unfortunate event that you do purchase a fake product the first thing you need to do is throw that product away you have no idea what it's filled with it could be full of pesticides and other harmful chemicals last step demand your money back and only smoke products that you validate on [Music] diamondindustries.com", "OyDk3o2pDSA": "how's it going YouTube this is Alex from T vape TV in this studio with a look at the best

another video you'd like to see please throw it down in the comments below until next time my name is Alex forty babe TV and for all you connoisseurs out there keep vaping [Music] you", "uWELXO1__xI": "what's good guys um good to see you again sorry to take a little break i was going pretty hard need a week to just chill but anyways i got a special review today we're going to be going over a 10 cartridge versus a 50 cartridge i know a lot of people they just want to they just want to get high they just want to get high really quick discreetly um and for cheap which is understandable that's why these 10 cards used to be really popular back in the day i was even hooked on these 10 cards for a while just because it's it's it's cheap it's cheap cheap to get high but that has changed now i don't cheaply intoxicate myself i smoke the very [ __ ] best best that i can find so first off let's give it a look it has this um kind of like iron type titanium look to it some ridges um looks cool distal it's flat not moving let's get a little puffer nothing to really complain about i mean ooh this is something to complain about cannabis extracted with butane so i don't know how many uh ppms is in here i don't know how many parts per million uh is left over of butane in this in this cartridge but that would turn me away and that's probably one of the reasons i don't buy these i didn't actually know it was extracted with butane but now i do but yeah now we got uh some dab logic um that tasted okay there wasn't really too many complaints about it it's not like i full on tasted butane dab logic nice little uh laser laser print around this um it looks like it's natives or aztecs or something has dab logic written across the bottom take this off and snap this on now right off the bat i can it can automatically taste a more it's a more natural taste uh you're not gonna be really be able to tell maybe if you're like you know not used to knowing what quality tastes like if i were just a noob coming in here these would both taste very very similar it's not like you can taste heavy butane in that or anything it's just me knowing that this was processed with butane what turns me away but that's you know it's ten dollars worth of butane now what makes these so different why is this ten dollars why is this fifty dollars a big part of this is gonna be extraction these guys oil they're in the market for wholesale they make most of their money off distributing large quantities to dispensaries they're targeting the market that you know is wanting to and toxic intoxicate themselves for a lot cheaper now these guys these guys are marketing more towards the connoisseurs uh this extraction this was not extracted with butane uh there's a process i'm not too sure how it goes down or how they get it into cartridges but i know there's lots of ways to uh extract and get solventless you can do a fresh chop wash that in a bucket of ice water extract those tricoms in a ice hash then press that and then here comes your rosin i don't know how they liquefy it or what consistency and uh temperatures they do to get it to this consistency in this cartridge but they do and it works so what you're mainly paying for right here and why this is so so much more expensive is that is that when people are washing this and uh when they're extracting uh from this method you yield also a lot less from just blasting a can of butane through a whole bunch of weed this process you actually your yield is a lot smaller um but you have a higher quality so that's where the 50 dollar price mark come from but you know a lot of people really don't care but a lot of people do care and this is this is the main differences sorry you can't see the table the camera's up a little too high uh but yeah anyways uh i hope you like this video i hope i covered everything um and there's like a lot more there's like a lot more there's a lot more labeled on this solvent-less solvent-less vape and for those of you that don't know solventless i had a friend ask me i've explained rosin to them but sometimes people don't remember solventless is processed without solvents like butane co2 what else do they use um that's all i can think of out of my head those are the main ways that people use to extract those are solvents this is solvent less solvent less is the way to go your lungs are going to be a lot happier your high is going to be a lot better and you might say well [ __ ] i don't want to spend 50 on a cart i'm going to stick to 10 that's ok but also you have to keep in mind this is going to pack a harder punch because it's way more purity in this than that other cartridge i didn't mean to be a dick i shouldn't do that i'll [ __ ] it uh but anyways i don't even know where it went it wasn't too far anyways it doesn't matter but yeah those are the main differences a 50 card versus a 10 card i know a lot of people see it in dispensaries and they're like why the [ __ ] is that cart fifty dollars well now you know uh glad i got to do this video a lot about to see you guys uh subscribe uh i'm gonna be doing some merch drop soon so you know stay tuned turn on those notifications uh and i'll see you guys soon uh probably my next video i'm gonna be comparing some of the weed i grew and some of the weed my friend grew and we're gonna put it up against some dispensary weed and show you why potentially home growing could be better than commercial growing that's not always the case but for 99 of industry it is um peace out guys take care let me know in the comments what other videos you want i love uh i love getting suggested new ideas because sometimes i don't know what are good ideas and i just go off top but thanks guys for watching peace out", "2sPYkWFd91I": "okay today we are going to replace some parts on the Moen faucet so we're gonna replace this piece which is the cartridges down inside here this is a tool that comes with it to remove the old one we're also gonna replace this piece which is just underneath here which holds the handle and this pulls the other piece up and down and then of course swivels whether you want hot or cold so the first thing you wanna do of course is next thing that does remove this cap I've already removed it just to make it a little bit quicker here this will come off and then you're a hot and cold indicator set that aside now my case this is broken there is a set screw that's down inside here you have to loosen up normally to take this off but it's broken so I know mine is gonna come right off that takes care of that I'll have to get that screw out of there of course this is the other piece I'll be replacing once I showed you it's that right here okay also this on the screws you're gonna undo that pop that off and you can phillips bit to take this screw out here and keep in mind this piece these two pieces and the screw to screws to go with it is one thing in water and the cartridge is a separate thing they don't come together you order them separately and this just lifts right off and this unscrews as you can see you can actually lay these things out in order that they came off and just make it a lot easier when you reassemble it there's a little spring-loaded ring here we gotta get the old cartridge out a little washer comes off first about you get it more remove this clip break which holds that from turning you can see that little piece coming out right there so that's gonna come out then hopefully I didn't break this thing already this will turn loosening up so make sure that's good and loose and then you're gonna have to use a pair of pliers pull that up out there so I get a pop so once you've turned that several times should be oh crap stop pulling that out there you go there is the old one and slide it down in try to get it lined up on the way whoops sometimes which you can do is put this on top of it and you can push that down which will actually help set that right down in there and then you may have to turn it to line up with it clip bring these to go so then the clip ring goes back in then you have this little washer here it goes back and it only go one way because it's actually got flex it alright and that's on there then this goes on and this this is plastic so take your time make sure you don't cross the right it only goes one way it'll lock down on there one thing when you put this on you'll notice there is a higher lip right here that goes in the front and the reason for that is this will sit down and that stops it from there that's your cold and you swing over here for your hot and it hits and stops so you want to make sure you have that in the right position [Applause] Oh much nicer okay so we got to put this piece back on cuts on the left it's not at your house and something else is wrong and in that clips in position like that and all we have left to do is turn the water back on okay we have the water on and there's that goal and this works very easy now that's how you fix a Moen faucet and that is part number 1225 B that's the pretty much the standard for all one-arm Moen faucets thanks for watching

that make sure you guys leave a comment down below let's get into this [Music] yo yo what's good youtube this is two stone for you and today we're back with another 510 cartridge today we're going to be smoking on some fire og so yeah let's get into this review so this fire og 510 cartridge is by the brand hex go i picked this up on the ocs website for 3150 for a half gram of this shatter dislike whatever you want to call it and that's honestly not a bad price at all for this strain it's clocking in at 75 to 85 percent thc as you can see here our batch is 81 percent so that is actually relatively high the plant type is a hybrid you can pause the screen right here and read all the information you like this product is a co2 extraction but enough of that and let's actually get into the review when i did buy this actually i took off the duty stamp because i did intend on smoking it but then i was like wait wait wait let's make a video on this because uh you know i'm sure everyone wants to know what this cartridge is like so on the back here we have some really weird instructions on how to open it you have to put your two fingers in here like this apparently and slide this one up like that and then apparently you get your vape cartridge to come out and uh yeah holy they can even come out so there's our vape cartridge and this cardboard piece let's uh pop this out here i don't even know what i was saying there but we have those two rubber pieces here to protect the mouthpiece and the thread piece i kind of have it nice and zoomed up here right now but as you can see we have our thc logo and that nice blue hexo logo unfortunately there is nowhere on this cartridge that is saying there's fire og which is not a bad thing but i tend to mix up my cartridges a little bit when they're not labeled as you can see we have that nice golden distillate inside of this and i honestly can't wait to smoke on this and try it oh so i will say the stuff i was smoking on before was super sour diesel by daily special if you haven't seen that review i'll leave it in the description below and you can also check the video right here let's take this empty cartridge off let's put on this new bad boy all right so now we got our new cartridge on the pen you can see this one looks pretty cool compared to this one because we have a black tip and this one's like all clear and i've never seen one like this yet i'll bring it up a little closer so you guys can get a better look hopefully with a little close-up you're able to see what i was talking about and get a better look at everything inside the pen not that there's much to look at but you know what i'm talking about i guess the main part everyone wants to know is how does this smoke so make sure you go grab your pen you have your pipe your bong whatever you're smoking and let's try this today because we're about to give this a whip fire og by hexo let's go [Music] the smell from this fire og gives off that nice i don't even know how to describe it spicy aroma i don't i don't even know how to describe this one's like yeah it gives off that like spicy aroma like i don't know how to describe that smell and that taste is a classic fire og taste to fully review this cartridge i will definitely have to give this a 7 out of 10 not only for its price but for the flavor and the high that it gives off this fire og cartridge by hexo is definitely going to be up there on one of my top 10 favorite cartridges that i've ever tried this to me is definitely if you see it in your dispenser or even on the site i would go and pick it up shout out to hexo for a really great cartridge in my opinion definitely a really great cartridge make sure you guys don't forget to give this video a like and hit that subscribe button down below and let me know if you guys have tried this cartridge or any other by the extra brand because i'd like to know and if you guys have any suggestions for the next video please let me know in the comments down below that's it for this 510 cartridge review make sure you come back here on thursday to see a brand new video thank you all for watching and stay stoned", "pQIp6xChq0U": "I so basically how you want to start is with wires just like this just from a USB cord just like that and you just cut the charging part off and then you'll have this right here so you want to spread your wires out evenly and then I already nipped down the green and the white cuz you don't need those you just want to want to cut those off and just leave the black and the red you don't need to Greener the white just make sure that when you cut them off you just have two wires that aren't touching and you'll be completely safe because the other ones don't have anything to do with power so once you look like this you're perfect that's exactly what you want to do alright so then what you want to do from here is get these Clippers these little nail clippers and then you just want to kind of score the wire and pull it off this is if you don't have a wire stripping you could do this cuz this is what I did as you can see I suddenly cut it right there but after you just strip this little coating off you're gonna be done you're gonna be completely set it's that simple you're gonna be able to vape without a battery it's literally that simple right after you get the it stripped alright so this is exactly what you want to look like right now you wanna have your two wires your red and your black wire and that's exactly what you need for this to work just the silver tips right there it's already stripped and everything that's perfect so what you're gonna do is you're gonna take your device your cartridges your vape cartridge you're gonna stake the black wire into the hole and then once you get that and you're gonna use the red wire and touch it to the side of the thing and then that'll start eating up but it won't burn don't worry it won't burn through fingers so you can see smoke inside of the thing there you go there you go so that's exactly how you do it you just need to be plugged into a source and you can just keep hitting it over and over and it's infinite all right let me know if you want to see another video like this guys I could teach you how to make your homemade bait battery an entire battery that you could take on the go portable let me know if you want me to tell you how to do that let's go for a hundred likes and I'll do that are you", "zHAhDfnIECY": "[Music] hey everyone welcome back to my channel it's your girl Mariah if you were new to this channel welcome if you were returning subscriber welcome back um before we get into this video I want to you guys to subscribe like comment and share this video um this video is going to be a video that um kind of gives you guys how about like an idea of what I use to help me deal with my anxiety back in January I suffered my very first like severe anxiety attack which also led to a panic at hot um which I had to be rushed to the hospital I couldn't breathe I really didn't know what was happening in like guys I was talking to the nurses and you know everybody they kind of you know knew the symptoms and you it was so they didn't want to medicate me but to you know speak to a group in one so before that happened I was taking a product called just CBD they were gummies they were featuring gummies I think there were about like 250 milligrams for CVD I believe I don't have the continuous with a lot of them um so I was using those those helped me a lot with like sleeping just getting through the day I'm I normally take one in the morning and then take one at night from what I was going to bed um and then I switched over to the vape CBD I know in some areas um vaping is banned I'm in my state it's the e-cigarettes um when choosing you brand for vaping and I know like I said everyone's gonna be like oh baby it's dangerous I think this um being able to find a brain that you trust um with their products and you know what's in it they're transparent about it with something big going into it um I have a smoke shop in my area in downtown Boston in the cold smoke city shop I will link them down below they also sell just CBD products they sell the gummies but they don't so be the they being or the cartridges um so I wanted to show you guys a little haul of items that I got now do you also want to clarify in this video this is not a sponsored video by just CBD these are thought of my own products just brought my own money and so nothing you know was sent there's no sponsorship in the city I'm not being paid for this this is my own opinion my own thoughts on the brands as a whole so without further ado we're gonna jump right into it and we're gonna open these little bad boys I did split it to make sure everything was any in make sure I had everything that I got in it so we're just gonna jump right into it so the first item we are going to pull out is a date juice I got this in the flavor mango mango ice is the flavor and it's a hundred and it's a hundred milligrams and we're gonna open it and see what it looks like on the inside so this is the big bottle that it comes with and this is like set for a pretty good decent price for it I believe it wasn't check step inside so these were $15.99 each so I have this flavor like I said it's the mango mango ice in that flavor and I spend on the side of the box um it does give you the where it's talks about it being um tobacco free conveniently need for your e cigarette vaping devices for intense sources and like I said CBD does not replace going to your doctor if you do take medication continue to consult your doctors on that me I just don't want to be medicated so like I said I do the gummies and now I'm like I said I'm switching over to the the oils I can so take it with me so I'm not carrying on this big bike like jock of gummy so it's kind of like another convenient for me I'm gonna see what other goodies I'm having here we also have the pineapple Express and this one comes based off of the Navy find out for sports if you have not seen it so it comes like this as well the same jar just different flavor you see it looks like a fair way to open it there we go you can smell it too so that that was also $15.99 I got three different flavors on this one is watermelon og time I want to get like flavors um if you do follow me on instagram you would have saw that I posted in a story I'm all plus the story in this video somewhere on the screen um I've gotten a pen from Busey so I have an Uzi pen the cartridge on top comes from panda sticks I believe that's how you pronounce it I will also link that pen in the cartridge down below if you want to go purchase those too I got that ez pen in that cartridge first because I knew this was coming and with everything going on I did not know if I was going to receive anything I'm via the mail but everything was still running normal and I got it within a good decent time frame so this is what the I said watermelon og looks like in this big bottle and I love the fact that the bottles are big like these are very big bottles for the price that I got them before like I've seen like I said in the smoke shop I go to they have like bottles smaller than this for the same price so I love the fact that these are big bottles they'll last me a while and I'm glad I got the three different flavors that they did I love the that I have so I'm really glad I got those and then I have a disposable cartridge it's like this is the watermelon so the Sigma C of OG 1 for it so this one is a disposable one this one is 200 milligrams for these cartridge let me open it so it looks like and then from boozy I did I do have an order coming from them my main include them in this video but it's this is more of a just EEE video because this is the main products that I'm going to be using like I'm not gonna go back to the Panda stick cartridge Luzi I'll keep the pen just cuz I have so I'll have the pen so I had two different pens so I also gun pen from just CBD but I'm just sticking to just CBD I'm not switching I'm not doing anything like I said I enjoyed the brain as a whole their response to customer service is really good like things like it's not like you're not waiting a whole entire day to hear back from somebody if you have an issue on a product I mean you can get a response right away so this is the and I may switch over to this one today this is what the pen looks like if I can get ever get it out hopefully by the end of this video I can get it out for you guys and show you guys what it looks like and put it on the pen so we're gonna sit this off to the side real quick so what they're also like I said I did order a battery so this is what the battery looks like um theirs is a 5-10 VV twist battery um the Uzi stick I have is also a 5-10 battery so I can also use the cartridges from just see beating on that pen in the future but like I said I did order 3 of the cartridges from Louise because I did order an Uzi pen so like I have three pens now so I have the first uz one be just CBD one I just showed you and then there's another one coming from Uzi so they each have their own cartridge and I can grab the Izzi pen and she goes it looks like I want to get this pout oh yeah my Lu Zhi ping it's like a little metallic like rainbow fish color the other one is a Rastafari so it has a Jamaican colors and this is the cartridge up top so the cartridge up top is from panda stick and like I said I will link it below and the stick is from and the battery is so easy so that is that one so I'm ordering so I ordered another battery in three of the cartridges to be able to fill because the only thing with just CBD I did not see and even I missed it but it's okay that they don't have like the cartridges sold on their own like he does like it was he has the ones which we can be filled with liquid so just CBD didn't have those and less like I said I missed it and I didn't see it hopefully in the future they do release some like that so we're like individually in the art empties like this one is if I don't think I can get the cap off for this one I can try but I so this is what this one looks like is the like I said the watermelon flavor we're gonna do a test to see how it tastes and like I said as I know people's concerns are she like be safe and I am like I said I'm not walking around like every hour gaping I'm I normally do it in the more like in the morning when I wake up I do about two to pups that's it um and then that night same thing two puffs that's it so I'm not like so because the guy was like oh this cartridge should last you you know only a couple of days like this has lasted me like almost a week and I guess I can show you what it looks like when everything goes down but has lasted me I pretty decent amount of time because I'm not pulling on it and I keep it my pen stays on 3.3 v so it does not leave that area so it does not leave you can see it on the bottom it does not leave that smart so like it's on the lowest of the low so I'm not puffing so much so this is what the pen looks like and I love that piece and these have a lower voltage so these this one starts at two point two point zero B this one starts at three point three in the highs that it goes to is four point zero which I love so I can definitely put that on a smaller voltage I'm sold it like I said so and then this is my charging port that will go into it like I said I also have another the same thing came with this one that was e1 mix and I love effect you just twist and it comes on so these are the two that I have like I said this one is just CBD which is labeled is label sorry about that my camera dies I'm gonna make this really quick so these are the two that I have and then the last item I don't know like there was a certain thing going on but they sent me a free a free item I don't know if I mean it's like I never tried this so this is there just and it's a body soap I'm so I'm down there to really try this in the flavour of cherry pie and it smells really good I open the box I like what I'd like smells really good I didn't know this was even in there so I'm kind of a little free treat to try it so you guys so I'm definitely I'm going to try this come to night and see how I like it and see how it worked like fields and they said it's created for all faces and all skin types to enjoy to him him Ronnie so so it's handcrafted body so label and sing it with it I'm not the lighting looks different in the camera looks flipped in a different way please excuse me I kind of switch over to my phone to film the remainder of it so yeah so this is the soap duck I said that came with it um this one I did not purchase on my own um this one was sent in the box I don't know if it was like a free gift and he spent so much I said I opened it it was in there so thank you just

an Allen wrench set a rag or hand towel and a new cartridge for your faucet first turn off the water supply beneath the sink then open up the faucet to release any pressure use a hand towel to cover the drain in the sink both to protect the sink from your tools and in case you drop any small parts next we need to remove the handle to get to the screw holding it in place pry off the decorative cap then use your allen wrench to remove the screw set this in a safe place you're going to need it to reattach the handle at the end now we'll disassemble the faucet each faucet is a little different but they all have some combination of housing screws or clamps that need to be removed in order to get to the cartridge to pull out the old cartridge use your channel lock pliers pay close attention to how the cartridge sits you'll need to insert the new cartridge in the same way now take your new cartridge and insert it into the faucet replace the assorted hardware that you removed earlier now we can reattach the faucets handle using the allen wrench and reinsert the decorative cap with your faucet reassemble turn the water supply back on and check for leaks thanks for watching to check out

a front kick and it's dripping [Music] the tap itself designing two years old is the quarter turn ceramic cartridges within the tap I'm hoping and whatever it's a couple of figures tripping so I'm hoping I'm going to be able to take the cold water take cartridge out and clean it up we're not in a really hard water area but it might have a bit of lime scale in there might be a little bit dirty if I take to put take apart clean up the ceramics and stick it back together again hopefully is going to be okay can't use our about 20 quid and we're not going to worn out because the taps I'll accept it two years I'm just not very it's not very long at all and we'll give it a clean sink back together again and hopefully cure the problem first things first we need to turn off the cold water feed you see the commenter's to switch off the the stopcock going into the kitchen itself so just so I'm turned off the isolated out we've drained down is nothing left in there now so magic we can now start to tighten the taps [ __ ] okay and on the back of it the tap handle there's a tiny little hole there which is a t8 Torx bit so if we stick that in there which now reveals the cartridge assembler so now to remove the cartridge assembly just grab all the back and turn it or sheet on it that's really too much I can go span on it okay second attempt we've got twelve Mills pile up so I so tired there's a bit of water you should crack it off five times that's just the water coming out and neck of the tap and dribbling down okay now we're looking in here consider this a bit of lime scale knocking about we've got the the cartridge there [Music] anyway slip it to boats and see what's going on okay so here we have the little cartridge valve and what we're going to do is pop out the little syrup on the end pull the rubber ring out and then the whole shaft should push through the valve which will then reveal all these ceramics inside so let's give that a bash so first of all this pop out a little silicon ring on the end you lost it down to see ya just push up through now so fast Pittman is the ring and I know separator which is linkages with this which is a set of ceramic with two little noggins on each side so again you can see we've got signs of launch scale on that you can see where the valves going with that is the long scale inside there as well so it's looking good that I should be able to put some line let's go remove in here and clean this up so that's not a little further that's the first face that's the second face so we're going to get a bit of the long scale removal give them all a clean pop it back together again and actually that'll be that so I'm using the same what it is multi-purpose D scale up this is bought from Amazon five litres and that it will sustain quick but it's going to last a long time so I'll clean coffee machine with it all sorts so I'll stick a better light in there straight these scaling your toilet and all sorts it is a liquid stuff so I've got these little shims into the D scale up and also get that a get that a bass as well okay that's nice little Superman under will be put some lipstick on his hand believe that Siderius thing I'll leave that off an hour ago just to clean that off I'm going to just put a bit of this in the end of the tap as well that's where this is all going to fit I guess line and then if there's any launch girl in there as well it will dissolve that as well okay now for reassembly so the components we've got they've all been cleaned in the descaler and just took them out okay so important things to know is on the way back in on rebuilding the first piece obviously the one buddy the long indent on it is going to fit into the indent within the cartridge the second piece has got a little dot on the front that faces outwards so let's go with this since if we can't get it all back together again first pieces in there here that's dropped down to the onto its locating pin second place you've got to look server-side there so that's going in like that and last but not least is the valve we just said development about the silicon seal make sure get in there now we press all up down and state B we're going to pop the clip back on just rotate it while I press it in nitrous woman back in nicely so push down and lap should now be able to get that clip circling back on that right now there we go so there we have by together again no justice a [ __ ] turn and we're going to have you turning as we want it so let's stick up back in there stick up back in the tap and see if it leaks okay so here we go for reinstallation I'll just give that a quick one again going side there slide the valve in and start to twist it back in again okay montage it was before okay so let's just level these up now so off position is where it is there so now I have pointing upwards down I should go to put the coop scree bucking can what there before do that I think I'm going to try and see weapons so I'll turn the water back on okay so they tend to walk back on again let's go to the town expecting a few Buster they're all there the hot water Thank You sobbing it won't repair none is beautiful so I'll just do the roof screwed back up in the tap and then I'll turn it on that water pulling out there you go to them [Music] little job in jobs the golden thanks for watching bye Stanley 20 quid I'm a plumber [Music]", "0V9NRRk0FQA": "hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're going to be talking about the fastest booming trend which is concealer vaporizers for cartridges so let's say you're on the market for a new concealer first of all I hope you stop by vape honey stay calm to check out our selection because this is something we've really been working on and making sure that we innovate but you're on the market you want to know what the differences are what the categories are and certain things that you can go through or buy to make sure that you made the right decision for the cartridges that you like to purchase so today we're going to take an in-depth tour and talk about the differences between our concealers to make sure that when you buy you buy the perfect concealer okay so there's two general categories to these concealers you have ones that have the cartridge exposed and ones that have the cartridge is completely hidden okay these are kind of a way that we like to separate the vaporizers and then there's differences in between them as well so let's start off with the ones that keep the cartridges concealed so you cannot see them now most of them that on the mark and all of ours are powered by magnet adapters so you can simply pull the cartridge out and you have a magnet adapter now why would somebody want a concealer like this well first of all it looks cool second of all it keeps your cartridge completely hidden for discretion and it also protects it from anything hitting it or possibly breaking it and they fit and sit up right in the pockets they're very very sleek in size so that they will easily fit into you know the small pockets for women's purses and the small pockets you know the upper pockets on your jeans like so it stays completely head so first thing for people is size I want to show you guys this is our beekeeper model this is our latest elf model and this is our phantom model so everybody knows what a sip we're not promoting combustion here guys we are vape company but just to show you how size pairs up everybody knows what a standard sized Bic lighter with the size is so to take our beekeeper for example they're actually very close in terms of width as well as height for the body now we move on to our elf and then last our phantom so let's start off with our first model the beekeeper the beekeeper is a very good unit it was actually our first model that we launched in this concealer category and it has been our historical best seller it comes with a magnet adapter simply drop in the cartridges and it actually has a push button operation so you would push and hold this button throughout the time that you inhale and you also click it five times on five times off this unit produces about 20 watts of power and it also has a a 300 milli amp hour battery so it's gonna last longer than the standard batteries and it's also give you more consistent power it has a micro USB charge also that you can just plug right into the side port right there and then when you get a new cartridge you can just take the Magna DAP tur which if you lose it try not to lose it you can purchase more online you just screw it onto your cartridge and you drop it in so then once you hear a click and your unit is on your rate of vape so well we get from a lot of people is that there's a variety of cartridges that are on the market and some of them are wider than others so some people are concerned to order a concealer unit before you know when they have their cartridge to make sure it's gonna fit so what we're gonna do here is we're going to measure the openings so that you know how wide our concealers are before you make the order so let's start off with the opening of beaky so in millimeters this is exactly a 10 millimeter opening so if your cartridges are wider than 10 millimeters in diameter they will be too wide to use for the beekeeper now let's move on to the elf we just launched this unit a couple weeks ago it's something that we're really excited about it's available in five colors give you a brief little look the only one missing from our display is the white one which we do have available what makes itself unique is that it's not only a little bit smaller than the beekeeper it has a little bit more capacity so it has 350 milliamp hours so the battery's gonna last a hair longer it has a really nice texture to it I would compare it to if anybody has ever had a like an iPod Nano it has this very um the this this kind of grippy thick metal you just feel the quality when it's in your hand you know completely solid unit what makes it unique is that it is completely buttonless so it's Auto draw so people who really you know have been holding on to those pull through batteries this is the evolution the next step and the way that the technology is is you are just gonna get effortless draws on this vaporizer it is gonna be much smoother much more powerful and it's gonna fit a larger variety of cartridges that those auto draw batteries cannot fire now the kick comes already with a glass really high performance ceramic cartridge with a ceramic mouthpiece so if you are not buying prefilled tanks and actually filling them then this is like an awesome tank to get started with and all you do to get this thing fired up is its there's no clicking anything you just put your Magna adapter onto your cartridge drop it in and inhale and you will see it light up very smooth very good unit charge with a microUSB and again it's a little bit smaller which brings us to our ultra premium unit which is the Phantom the Phantom is not only for cartridges it actually comes with a wax concentrates adapter which is dual quartz it is our largest unit in terms of size comparison but it also has a thousand milliamp hour batteries so it's gonna laugh last about two and a half times what all the other concealers do now one unique function that this unit has is when you flip it open it has a squeeze action trigger so you just squeeze it to inhale and it also has four different temperatures that allows you to dial in to what intensity and flavor you really prefer and it ranges from 3.4 all the way to 4 volts it has a advanced preheat function and the unit also comes with two magnets a longer one as well as a shorter one so all different sizes of cartridges you can have the perfect magnet for it so your mouthpiece collar will sit flush and you will keep your cartridge completely concealed now what the beekeeper and elf do have in common is they both have windows so you don't have to excavate your cartridge to see what level it's at but they do do a good job of keeping it concealed so that is really a rundown of these cartridges now let's get into the width testing for these two these we've made slightly bigger as the cartridges have gotten bigger it is a hair under 11 millimeters we're getting 10.9 so most cartridges are labeled 11 millimeters are actually a hair under 10 point 9 so this will fit a standard 11 millimeter cartridges which actually does fit into the wider category now let's check out the phantom the Phantom has a slightly skinnier opening than the elf and it comes in at ten point eight five millimeters so that will give you a good idea if you already have a cartridge that you are buying prescribed to to make sure that the unit that you get will fit so to recap the beekeeper has a ten millimeter opening the elf has an 11 millimeter opening and the phantom has a ten point eight millimeter opening that will drop cartridges in but let's say you have an extremely wide cartridge what do you do well that brings us to our second category of concealers which is found in our mini max line you can check out a really cool in depth review done by a high-rise on our mini max to show you just how powerful it is which is our smart tip key fob vaporizer it's very light and with this line what we want to do is make them very light concealable and make sure that these units fit onto your keychain this these units both have 500 milliamp powered batteries the difference is this one has a variable voltage which is our minimax Pro and this one is a single voltage but it automatically adjusts to whatever cartridge you put on it it has a smart chip in it this unit the minimax Pro has three different voltage settings with a maximum output of four volts the minimax what you would do is when you purchase your cartridge it could be as wide as you want all you do is you take it and you screw it into the 510 threaded opening and it's similar to a standard battery but it is a little bit smaller much lighter and you have a charging port right here so the cartridge is exposed when you have a cartridge on it however it is a device that is designed to look like a key fob or a clicker which does make it discrete when you don't have the cartridge attached to it then we have our minimax Pro which looks a lot like a key fob and it even has a deluxe keyring holder there and a micro USB but what's cool about is you don't see the cartridge because it's actually folded in there and then you push this button at the top to flip it open and what we did is just to show this flip open as we use one of the widest cartridges on the market which is a Liberty variable air flow model and it actually does fit in here so this will fit cartridges and we'll check the size of this opening right here this will fit 11.6 millimeter cartridges so the mini max pro and the mini max if you're buying extremely wide cartridges are your best bets to making sure that your vape pen is gonna deliver power concealability and stealth-like options if they're very wide if you buy skinnier cartridges or are filling your own cartridges we went through these features and on our channel at vapor store direct on youtube we have in-depth detailed reviews unboxings and feature comparisons on the individual items so I suggest

dollars make sure you guys hit that like subscribe and hit that bell and make sure you uh if you want to legalize medical marijuana make sure you hit that subscribe button you guys rock here we go so this one here i already did open uh i've been smoking on it i love it it's a great great great great sativa rhythm is a great company uh there you go picture of the cartridge from rhythm nice liquid don't move at all straight uh nice thick thick stuff throw it on the battery here like so like i said i've been using this one a little bit so i mean it does have uh some out of it but then we have this one here this is the gelato from alera this one is also a hundred dollars but they even bling this one out for you it has a golden blinged out uh cartridge and i did take a couple hits it was full so i mean it was fuller than that but i just figured i'd do uh the most expensive cartridges uh video but oil looks good it's a little lighter than the other stuff and to be honest with you i always thought the lighter stuff was better but i'm starting to think the darker is better i don't know but yep let's give this guy a try we'll flip his camera around and uh try these babies out now this one here is what i don't like you need a big battery for uh you need either a push button battery with a big high voltage or something like this a yo can to make this thing hit to its uh proper proper capacity because it has these air holes in the cartridge that are kind of a pain in the butt but like i said if you get a big battery uh it's not even a problem all right screw this on all right we got both cards hooked up and ready to go all right we'll start with the rhythm here this is lost coast travel diesel 1 gram 86 it's like almost 87 thc boom rhythm great company great cartridges they're half grams or a little a lot of head space in them this one here was pretty full i was really happy with it uh this has been three days now four days i had this and it's still a good bit left so i mean i'm liking how long they last it's really good oh whoa has a great uh citrusy flavor instantly three seconds in you feel it very good cartridge is it worth a hundred dollars no but very good cartridge love the taste of that lost coast travel diesel okay round two a second hundred dollar cartridge this is a gelato from alera gelato and then we'll give you the boom again like i said you need a good push battery for one of these so we've got the yo cam plus here make sure she's on she's on and here we go gelato is my favorite strain another 100 cartridge right here uh here we go that thing rips oh that gelato man i like it i really like that gelato i bought the 0.5 for like 45 or whatever it was 50 bucks uh this one here i got it for fifty dollars it was on sale i got it on a discount so i wouldn't pay a hundred dollars for these cartridges at all they're i mean they're worth it they're one grams but sell them for 85. come on give us a deal uh we should be 60 but then we go here this is the hundred dollar one here and uh like i said this one here i paid 86 for after the deals so i really didn't pay the hundred dollars for them but i did pay for them uh i don't know if they're on sale at a good price i would buy another one but i can't spend 100 on a cartridge you guys rock like subscribe hit that bell love you hey them [ __ ] got me dumb litter", "EMmYy7VGXZs": "hey guys his dab connection and we're going over transferring oil between cartridges and this is the easiest way I figured out how to do it based on a combination of other things I've read and someone on reddit had the idea of actually putting it into the syringe and then putting it through here so kind of modified that by taping it up so I tape it up and here's a upside down cartridge that I've taken the thing off and I'm transferring it into a real C cell and some people do this when the cartridge breaks I also do it if I find the cartridge that has particularly great oil but the hardware is not so good so this hardware is not so hot on this remedy cartridge but the oil is awesome and it's still a pretty good card but I'd rather hit in the C cell so it drains through here then once it gets in there I'm gonna put back in the little tip and I'm gonna push it push it down in there and then I'll end up there you want to let that seesaw soak for about 20 minutes and then it goes and then it should be fine to work a couple things on the note so I did take this piece off and before I took this piece off I had this right side up and I used a hairdryer to get the oil off the top of the mouthpiece didn't want to waste anything and then it's actually so you can actually have to sit for a while but sometimes always just a little too sticky Oh see that's nothing it cannot fall over something to speed it up a little bit by blowing on it but I'm going to hold that while I blow it and then you'll see the oil going down into there and then I'll do the final part well pump it into that final cartridge oil down I taped up this top one to make it easier you have to tape that you can also hold it on the end of the battery but he just blow on it make a little they also get my pillows too much them a little bit laughs in there and you know it's inevitable you might lose a little bit of oil doing this process and this Karcher is not a program anyway mid full half gram anyway partially used now get the rest of that in there today I got most of it as now that in there now when I take this apart and be careful to just just get those little last drops dripping down into there a sort kind of on the tail end here and you'll see that a lot of Italy just naturally went through the syringe already and that's why I have it already ready to go like that and I'll do a final pump to pump it all through but you see it's already kind of about halfway there also be careful not to melt your tape and into the thing either so what did I do when I when I finally I'm going to take this on the little head around my little top right there I'm gonna then do the push down to the center and then put it in there but you guys get the concept cartridge to serve and to cartridge that is what I have found the easiest way to transfer all between cartridges whether it's broken or whether you get some really fire oil and the cartridge just kind of sucks I personally would rather take a little bit of loss in the oil and not use this crappier cartridge and use the better cartridge because overall I'm gonna have overall better efficiency so if I lost 10% but it's 20% more efficient its overall it's a winner so after that I'm just gonna seal it up you guys really don't need to see that part but I'm just ribbing that apart pumping the back in and then capping it off there's dab connection thanks for watching guys have a great week", "YneOjcOnrw4": "Sasa right here has is a keep on leaking water this is by molten as you can see the red and blue logo right there so usually these leaks are pretty easy to fix first let's turn off the water underneath the sink turning clockwise let's turn off the both side water all right now the water has stuff so first thing you want to do is take off the little go next you want to use a hex key at 764 is what will fit in here and you want to loosen it up there's a hex screw in here behind the logo that you stick the hex key into then you just turn counterclockwise to loosen it up normally you don't have to take the screw out that much but I don't know why this is too stuck so I guess the host crew is up all right so this should come right out after a hex screw is out so that was off right now next there is a Philip screw right here that you take off that comes out and just plastic ring that now if I go down to this piece right here there's this little little piece behind here okay do you pull out this middle bracket that's pulled out swipe piece comes out after everything has been removed now you're down to only the cartage right here when you buy the EB placement part time zhalong with a little cap you place a cap on top right here and then you turn clockwise 90 degrees after done off that now you take some pliers and you pull out the cartridge from the top right here I'm just going to grab onto it and just pull it out so there are two types of Mullen postage for this type of faucet as you can see one is one 200 and 1 is 1 2 to 5 1 to 2 five-man plastic and 1 to 2 is solid brass well luckily I bought both of them and I found out that cartridge I pull out is the one that's plastic which is a 1 to 2 5 and I want to replace it with that one now with the cartridge out we can put a brand new one in and you just stick it all the way straight down and you want the plastic assuming I do you want the plastic to be aligned straight like that so after this is down in there push it all the way in and you can use use this to help push it down firmly down the next thing you need to do is just reverse the order first we put in the white cartridge and then I'm going to drop in the clip at the back and if everything is aligned correctly you should just fall straight right in there you go then I'm going to put this washer down in there next thing to do is to put in the chrome molding up there and then next is the Bundys round brackets apparently this was loose before now we're just going to tie it in so it's tight okay the next thing is this middle lever um there's a hook in the back and the hook goes behind the gray plastic make them lower down don't white plastic on top of the brass and let's put in the screw put on this and screw tight now we can put in the screw all right that's all the way put back that logo on here hid now let's come back on the water let's turn on the water you", "FGTP8FVp00c": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another buddy's cartridge video you know i'm saying but this one's special this one's a bit special because if you can see from the title it is the highest percentage of thc that i've seen on a buddies well uh that i've seen i don't know if it's the highest but it's 90 thc as you can see right here 90.42 and yes this is the distillate one so that's why it's high in thc but as far as like other buddies distillates or other live resins that i've had from them this is probably the the highest in range that i've had and uh the other two percent is some other stuff other than cbd but as you can see from the back right here it is 6.5 or 6.45 percent terpenes so pretty decent you know i've had some which were like 2 before so i'm happy that this one has ninety percent thc and six percent terpenes i can only imagine how it's going to taste um but i do have my tronian with me where's that and also the little adapter piece so let's just uh get to it and let's see i haven't had a buddies in a while actually i haven't had a cart in like a week or two because it's just they run out pretty fast for me but i've seen uh at authentic that they had buddies again like new strains so i was like okay [ __ ] it this 27 out the door the green box which is the live resin is 32 out the door so one of the best prices in town is going to be authentic for buddies so let's just open this i don't really care too much about the box and with this it's going to be a a very raw raw garden color yeah you see right here yeah very very nice let's just uh since uh since i do have my camera let me just take a picture real quick for the thumbnail you know that right off the bat it's very sweet very lemony is the most prominent yet lemony [Music] let's try this i'm excited i haven't had a buddy's car in a while so i can barely keep the excitement contain it you know what i'm saying so boys [Music] [Music] for some reason i taste the peanuts like the initial taste is the peanut and then it gets sweet pretty weird oh there's the lemonade there's the lemony taste okay it's a lemony slash orangey slash very [Music] so like i said the initial taste was like a peanut and then it gets sweet like a lemon sweetness maybe it's just the cart or something or maybe it's just 20 years a very different taste that i've had from previous buddies uh i wouldn't say i would compare it to a raw garden cannabis derived terpenes with this lid it's it's its own taste it kind of tastes like the cure company um tropicana cookies towards the end a very orangey very strong orangey taste but nonetheless very very enjoyable i didn't know gorilla glue terpenes tasted this lemony or this citrusy but not bad for 90 thc it's definitely gonna smack me but with gorilla glue it's a hybrid sativa or sativa dominant hybrid so it's definitely recommended to use you know during the day afternoon you know i'm saying but i would probably not use this as much towards the end of the night because for me at least when i smoke too much sativas at night it's very hard for me to sleep i don't know if it's for you guys as well but nonetheless a very very great part from buddies i like to address them some stuff people say about me always reviewing buddies or something but i spend my own money on buddies and that says something i i don't like when a person spends their money consistently on a product that means that that product is good just because you haven't seen buddies lately doesn't mean that i don't like them anymore i just bought all the strains that they had available to my dispensary when i drove monty and blake to the dispensary yesterday we went to authentic as well and i saw that they had cartridges at least new strains from buddies and uh you know i had to come back the next day and here we are making this video right now so like i said it's a very good cartridge very very different from what i'm used to tasting from buddies but nonetheless still enjoyable high percentage of thc and there's six percent terpene so you really can't go wrong with that i'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and we're probably just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed it you know what i'm saying um but yeah cheers three blinkers i barely move you do see a bubble in here though i don't know if that's peanut exactly but it's like if a peanut and orange mixed that's the taste no i like peanuts and i like oranges i just don't like them together but this is enjoyable i'm not saying it's battery it's just you know it's a weird taste but like i said uh if you get past the peanut taste it's a very enjoyable citrusy flavor towards the end but other than that hopefully you enjoyed the video peace out [Music] way back in the days", "ZzuxwwTKk5c": "oh this is not a plush toy to make me change I become like a castaway you know your page that you bought the color today game is goodie to get your voice mpg back at it with another fire waiting for you guys man so for today's review man I got a Corolla right here man yeah you heard it right kirova the comfy that makes I think they started off making edibles and then just the transition into making marijuana you know actual bud and then cartridges and things like that so they're branching out into the cartridge game I got myself right here it is a mimosa it is a Clement Lucie if I can go ahead and get that a little focused in for you guys one time so this right here is the momo mimosa it is a clement i'm / purple punch and men you know but most is is obviously one of the better sativas out there that i that i feel like you know they just the sativa that just gets you extremely baked but also lets you do your thing without making you feel like super super like your mind is running if you get what i mean which is something that a lot of sativas do so you got to be careful what you choose so yeah I got the memo so right here this one's sitting actually at a 78 point 81 percent THC so that's not too bad actually I was expecting a little bit a little bit more but honestly what can we can do right so open this up right away men it comes in this nifty ISO container I haven't seen any cartridges come in containers like these as of late so I uh yeah all you do is just unscrew this unscrew it all the way throw that to the side cuz you're only gonna need this cartridge so right here boys I got the mimosa from Corolla this is a full gram I think they do have it in half grams also I'm not too sure about that but I have seen full grams all over the place men on the bottom it says Korova unrivaled alright so we're gonna go ahead and test it out man see if it actually isn't rebel because I feel like with a lot of a let me mind you this is a distillate cartridge this isn't a librarian cartridge this isn't anything too special man so I'm not my hopes aren't too high I'm kind of hoping it tastes good I like my mosula it's one of the few teams that I like but you know when it comes to distillate not a lot of distillate companies can do good the only distillate companies I personally feel like I've been doing a great job with their product is dizzy and plug play those two distillate company - probably the only ones and wrong garden - just remember they're additionally company not a lot rather company so I want to take a ghost hit but I got the fan point I mean go ahead and turn off real quick boys here we go we got the Korova mimosa sitting on the raw garden battery I currently don't have any variable wattage batteries man I lost my favorite battery which was whose if you guys in a little slim twist one I'm trying to look for it I'm hoping I can find it soon but as soon as I find it you guys are getting Ben your video out of it man so before we take a hit demands go ahead and try to hit 500 likes on this video I appreciate everyone who's been tuning in lately man during this whole quarantine I've been getting a lot more subscribers and I just want to welcome you all to the GFN man so if you guys are over the age of 18 to 21 let's let's get to smoking boys chewed so right off the bat that first initial hit man I'm not gonna lie it wasn't to like like tasty I don't know if it's just the first hit that was like that let's go ahead and try to get the other wing quipped up and then because that's one thing that I wanna let you guys know to win and whenever tasting out a new code don't ever base off the first hit just for the simple fact that you know the coil takes a while to get whipped up and things like that you gotta burn through the oil and you gotta just absolutely taste the flavor so we're gonna be taking a couple hits and I'm gonna take a couple hits until we get into the flavor until we had super big so cheers guys mmm it doesn't all right after that second dish okay I did get a little bit more flavor I'm gonna go ahead and switch it to the dr. zodiac battery because I think that this one is a little bit stronger because for distillate cartridges the other ones for live resin so for that second hit though I did get a better flavor profile I tasted a little bit of a like a Clementine like a little sweetness sourness so not too bad not too shabby not too shadows go ahead and just keep going though [Music] the taste that I'm getting though is it is it isn't like a oh wow do you like you know just astonishing taste that you would like to get from a cartridge Billie like I feel like I'm getting more of like a dis elyda taste then I'm getting of terpenes like I I think this is lacking a lot intervenes as of now man after the first initial hits a man you should at least taste something you know you should at least provide a consumer with something that the first hit the first two to three hits man and you should just smack you in your face and want to keep want you to keep hitting it more and more right with this one I don't even feel like hitting it anymore just because off of those two three hits like I kind of don't even feel like I don't get that taste that I like you know I don't get that oh gee earthy goodness or I don't get that that fruity berry nasur I don't get anything it's just very very dissolute eat like if you know how desolate cartridges they just taste like like THC oil like just straight-up oil like and I mean that's that's one of my big issues with distillate companies you know you feel like for the most part you know desolate companies just don't get the the mixtures right when it comes to their disel is slash terpene mixtures it is just disgusting because you could either end up with a really really good dissolute like cartridge or pod like plug and play and dizzy where they kind of balance it out with the perfect amount of THC and the perfect amount of terpene and it also depends on what what you know dis lit you're using in the first place how refined it is how well process it is and what buddy used to produce that desolate and there's just so many steps and I feel like with this like they're not there yet they're definitely not there I'm sorry Korova but you're definitely not there yet I would probably just stick to edibles as of now man but I'm gonna go ahead and keep hitting it maybe it'll get better as we get along then so cheers guys like I am getting a little bit more of the mimosa now a little bit more yeah you like kind of more of the Clementine than the purple punch but like I said man just the ratio of dis Allah to Turkey mixture it's just like you want something and that's gonna be in your face you know you want to be able to taste it right here I feel like I'm just smoking straight of disel it like yeah I do get the little hints of Clementine in the back but it's just very very subtle like at this point I might as well just be smoking oil I just straight up this little oil with no terpenes because the terpenes then dilute it to making it less cheap see and then um damn a mother will just give us that you straight-up hardcore og dissolute man but I have nothing good to say about this I'm not gonna lie I have nothing good at all like these all right let's just break it down let me break it down for you guys so right off the bat I would say though I would say here's the upside of it they're packaging their presentation skills are phenomenal they post on weed maps they pose the pictures that they post the things that they post is just like oh [ __ ] that's the main reason why I got it in the first place this is the main reason why I got interested service because the presentation was outstanding just likes dizzy just like politically just like any other company that's doing big right now you know the packaging is on point that's something that I say is key in every single product because when you're looking at something you want to buy something that's visually it's visually appealing first then it is anything else you know because you're not gonna be able to taste the based off of a look so I'll based off of that that is another reason why I got it but opening it up like when I first saw this I liked I looked at the tip and it seems to be like not even a normal tip like some plastic [ __ ] so I touched it not even not a ceramic just a very very low grade and it's very very light though very very light compared to other cartridges not like I can I can barely feel like it's in my hand and then other than that man they that the oil quality it's thick it's thick I'm not gonna lie it's thick I've been hitting it this whole entire time and it's been it's been hitting it's been think it hasn't been moving at all definitely some good distillate but at the end of the day it all matters on how it tastes on how it gets you high it hasn't even gotten me high dude where are you going to take some fat-ass head see if it gets me home we go ahead and take a blinker for you guys if that boy here doesn't get me high I don't know what to say man so cheers guys go ahead and take a blinker with me [Music] he no longer expand me I got a little bit of lung stretch and just B's due to all this smoke go ahead but it wasn't like like crazy do you like with the plug play like I know I bring up other brands but it because it's comparisons you know you want to compare distillate brands with the distillate brands you want to because other other people who have tried who want to try kirova for example the chances are they already tried still Z plug play you know all the big names on marquee right now and this this is my job man this is what I'm here it's to tell you you guys you know what's good what's not that way yes don't go out wasting your money like I [ __ ] did pretty by the way that or cheat cart that I bought they didn't work at all guys so that's it down yeah nothing at all for that blinker I I feel a slight head change just off of that blinker but it's nothing like hot [ __ ] like I'm faded off my ass it's nothing like that at all and I'm kind of disappointed man like I feel like like people are just taking advantage of like the [ __ ] that they have you know the money that they have in trying to produce stuff that isn't good quality at all like I'm sorry but this these cartridge companies have to be stopped like these cartridge companies have to be stopped now because I'm tired of wasting my damn money on cartridges that look good look like they're gonna taste good but they're ass I'm [ __ ] tired of they do it alright so I'm from now on man I think I'm starting people I'm sorry calling companies out on the [ __ ] that they make because it's so disturbing man the amounts of money that I spend on cartridges and [ __ ] and still I am not satisfied with what people produce it's kind of like I thought that's just how it's gonna be man you know especially now with the inflation in the cannabis community if you were gonna be taking advantage of it but like it just sucks man so Korova you go F yourself I don't want anything to do ever with your product

cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "qPPSe6zEzEU": "let's go everybody Cuban chronic here another cannabis video / review here we got the bubbleman trinity pin by Marcus from bubbleman Richardson a big fan of his everything from his bubble bags to his dry sifting methods are definitely beyond any you can find anywhere else so you can always take bald man's word when it comes to concentrates in my opinion he came out with this fine bait pin unit see here oh this way it says bubbleman right on it nice silver always been my favorite tone was this nice metallic silver on the bait pin batteries he's got bubbleman B and bubbleman on his cart really slick little unit not gonna go through all that right now but this is mainly just to show how to fill a vape tank in this case of the bubbleman Trinity tank so in this case both man's got this really nice glass borosilicate glass or something like that outer and it's uh it's definitely it's able to take a lot of heat compared to most baked in so I go ahead and what I do take the cap off and you got this little opening here like most vape pens even the disposables look like this from brands like select other brands like that in recreational states I like to just heat the outside and you have these little glass syringes either come with select dabble bowls you get distillate and stuff from this from the dispensaries and outlets in little syringes like this also the blue river terpenes I believe come with a little syringe like this and you just mix your tips and your concentrates in the little glass syringe sometimes you gotta heat it I use my email and just kind of wipe the vial around on it just lightly heat it to get the oil to go where I need it to go and to use these that's all in my how to mix a sauce video you might want to check out but I'm gonna make this video as quick as I can here's the bubbleman Trinity tank I'm just gonna put my Enel coil around the edge and just heat this glass to a deist in temperature to where when the oil hits it's gonna run to the bottom I'm gonna show you guys how to load this without having the needle like they show in the bubble man Trinity videos this is for people that just don't have this is called a luer lock needle that would go here on the end and that's just for the dabbling hater and actually the terpenes come with the needle I have an eel but I'm gonna show you guys today how to load it with fountain one so you had this little tip here it's all glass these little dab of wool syringe containers for oil and I just heat this up on my email as well so I'm gonna heat both of them up and heat up the outside of the Trinity tank and I'm gonna heat up kind of the outside of my little syringe here full of turps and OG shatter his og chirps and Oregon Diesel OG shatter so so you can see when you have these syringes the oil starts coming out gonna suck them back so you don't lose any oil anyway I'm gonna show you the procedure around this little edge you see that hollow you just stick the dab locator end just right there against it and I just slowly press a nice bead around the edge of it and just keep it there against the seal and the edge of the container and since it's warm it's gonna just melt right into that space and I mean this is just for people that don't have the little luer lock needle that the Terps and things like that come with so you can see that oil is just dripping around there I'm just gonna heat it a little bit yeah I'll be really careful just little dabs of oil around the edge you really don't want to get ahead of yourself there we go hopefully show you guys a little view of this you can see the oils dripping down into the tank already it's looking pretty good so we're gonna go ahead add a little bit more around the edge here it's too crazy literally just wipe it off on there you know you learn to manipulate the oil a little bit doing this you'd see it's just draining down right into the right into it so let me see if I can get this a little bit closer for you see that oil is dripping down straight into the chamber see it slows down so you just kind of wipe it on the email again you can use a lighter on the outside and and just gently melt the oil down so anyway that's that's one way and some people be against it cuz you got to heat the oil a lot you can see it's just draining right down where it needs to go a little bit of oil left on the edge here and we just wipe into the pin here okay so well that's dreaming I'll show you guys one other method and that's with a luer lock needle and that's what these little dab locators have on the ends of them show you a sec this little needle off real quick so yeah you got these little luer lock tab locator your needles and so this this little lock that goes on the end of it so they just kind of slide on and off they twist on and off depending on where you get these from but that's what this locks into so these little needles come with my terpenes I ordered and usually get a little dab locator like this it really has to be heated to go through these needles and lock securely or all the oil kind of blow in between here but they work really well for Philly debate cartridges I'll show you now I'm gonna heat the oil good though and also heat the needle just a bit so that I know I'm gonna get a good run of oil through the end of it so I just heat the needle on the outside just a bit on my email lightly I don't want it too hot these are terpenes here and you can see it'll fit right in between that little space in the vial and as you've seen in probably other videos you can just just squeezes right in just see it there squeeze it all in there I fill the whole thing up use all the church sauce in there squeezed in there real nicely filled it up nice yes very nicely filled bubbleman Trinity pin and uh some little instructions in the Trinity says right here stand tank upright for 30 minutes to let after filling before use so anyway that's a little warning for you just kind of tells you what's gonna happen and if you're getting a boil around the edge like I said just heat it up a little bit make sure all your oil drains to the bottom I like to leave it open for a while with the cap off no matter what unit you're using if your units plastic definitely do not heat it it's not gonna work for you I recommend getting a glass one that's refillable admit to be refilled like bubbleman spins here I don't know if you buy those cheap ones I don't know if they're glass or not honestly people but bubble man's is definitely completely non-toxic materials all that stuff and I will say this is from a company that's called a w-9 tech or up tech and they are a great company any troubleshooting they're definitely there to help you they know a lot about their products so their customer service is on point and their shippings fast all that stuff man there's not a problem that I can understand why bubbleman chose that company and anyway there's the pin go ahead and just put the cap back on very nice I know I might as well just show you how to use the bubbleman pin click the button five times clicks on and now the greatest thing about the bubbleman pin is you can hold that button for up to 10 12 seconds but just take a rip and you hold it for 10 seconds don't even take her up and then hold it under 10 seconds and then start ripping and you'll get a huge rip but the the main process of using these from what they've told me is puff press and then pop so you let off the button afterward and clear the thing to suck more oil into the chamber to be burned for your next hit and it's a really good unit I've had it leak a little bit they sent me another cartridge and said hey man maybe it's a seal they just sent me another cartridge no questions asked they're great company so check them out a little demo for you so I'm going to puff press pump takes a minute to prime the oil but you want to let it just stand for 30 minutes so that it all that air bubbles and stuff come out but I like to heat the oil and it'll all just kind of exhaust the cap here and there and watch the bubbles come out of there and I mentally get all the air out and you can just hold that button literally watch it it's blue it'll turn off when it needs to do you get all that oil tar in it that's how you take a hotter DAP you see the size the hits you get me Trinity always cool it off afterward just by general inhale sorry about that coffin that's just how big it hits you get off this thing so anyway Cuban chronic this is the bubble man Trinity check it out at a w-9 tech or fresh head ease calm I gave it a 10 star review myself I mean I'm sure it'll be it'll be improved in the future who knows but it is definitely one of the best bait pens I've used as far as ripping first us stoners that's what we like nice good hits whatever hits we want light hits strong hits fill your own vapes there we go Cuban chronic dads ahoy everybody peace out", "qC9kjfAu2MU": "hey guys it's Nick with blue farms here just to show you a little tip to fix your pen if you're not getting any vapor off your draw so you can see here it was a nice slow steady draw the battery will light up but we're not getting any vapor trail so in order for your cartridge to work this little paddle on the battery has to come up and make contact with this little paddle on the cartridge alright so as you can see the little paddle on the cartridge side has been recessed so in order to get that paddle back up to the top of the threading we're going to use a little bit of arm spin take the sharp end of the bloom Farms pin to fit in this hole and just raise it up just a little bit very delicately so that it's even with the top of the threading alright so now that we've leveled the paddle off and it's nice and flush with the rings of the threading I'm gonna attach it back to the battery let's give it a shot", "eC4XsUNW2_I": "[Music] what's up everybody welcome back to a TC spot Here I am bringing you a half gram cartridge Himalaya life resin sauce cart yeah you heard it tonight resin sauce car gelato 33 recommended by my boy triple7 - looking for letting me know about this brand bro and anyways so yeah here we go this one doesn't contain no PG no EEG no MCT no artificial flavors no synthetics no synthetic turf beans so when I have food great stuff just all solid so I'm really looking forward to trying this my boy told me gelato 33 was the one to try they range from $30 to like 35 grams not bad for some knife resin sauce and yeah this one's a gelato 33 hybrid 84 percent total cannabinoids I believe the Teague's he's like yep 78 THC a two point five zero point three cc so yeah no pet no fillers we're gonna go in and slap it on the on this new friendly farms battery low temp to make sure we are tasting the full flavor of the terpene so you know here it is packaging is dope right off the back the Millea mission statement we started with single strand cannabis frozen fresh at the farm and carefully refine it to craft terpene rich full spectrum cannabis sauce look what the packaging is like so there's that little half gram it says cutter Mayberry that's understandable because my rink is out of service so I've been taking dad's we're named after the highest place on earth for a reason crafted with all the good stuff oh hi majesty see our full spectrum extracts higher than what we got it open well that's amazing that is amazing I've seen other life resin sauce parts they don't like this one this nice I won't say the brand but it's pretty dope with Malaya they got the little emblem on there nice color trying to get you guys to see a little bit of butter but it looks good for sure nice beautiful so now you know we're gonna go ahead and put it on the lowest setting there's your model 33 I'm really excited to try this is your average csail cart for your 510 battery take a turkey go dry eight okay I hate that artificial stuff so I'm glad they point that out these you know so enough yapping let's be a little nifty I haven't smoked for a good like three four hours or so let's check this out that was the first hand I'm where's the first hit I do have it at a very low temporary pasty that's for sure that's facts very tasty very very tasty it has a very pleasant gelato flavor doesn't seems like candy I love that the fact that it doesn't taste all artificial instead you know [ __ ] that [Music] so yeah this cart definitely tastes like some sauce I feel like if I'm hitting a puff coal or a rig on very low temp settings I can taste the gelato very good flavor no breath inhale very smooth I'm not sure what I caught I think that was just mean but very tasty pretty pretty pretty good head high pretty click that change sorry yep I can see the cloud because of the way the cameras position I'm getting some crazy clouds imma turn it up to the highest setting and we're gonna wrap it up real soon right it's getting up in here all crazy oh that's all bad there we go I said he was definitely stronger on that higher setting tastes like straight sauce I like it live resin solace cars check them out in Malaya good head high this is a hybrid gelato 33 doesn't taste like frickin candy straight taste like flour oh yeah for sure job can't see the cloud I like the fact that tastes like I'm Annie no [ __ ] bad so it's getting pretty hot I'm gonna get up out of here yo this is just embarrassing reading over here starting his [ __ ] sweat I just wanted to give you guys a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "RQw25ed-2c0": "welcome to the shed this eye style images coming at you with another product review this one I never even heard of this company before I don't know other than the guy I picked it up from I don't know anybody else that has ever bought this this brand or ever at a house party or anything you know there's no idea it's getting a little a little stuck now just so you can see from my bounnam Pro like sticks right there now I don't really [ __ ] need it but it comes in handy so this is super Lemon Haze it is not platinum veins for the one guy that I asked me to do the Platinum babes one I did a super lemon haze in the MKX card so I believe it was and now this one is cure super haze C so cartridge 510 threads you know the normal really unless you're getting a pod or something no no the kid I got this from was telling me how the oil is really thick and it takes a while for the bubble to move he said it took like a half hour for him to get the bubble to move from the side to the top it was in my pocket for not that very long and the bubble moved so not fast so I'll show you that in a second so on the label I get a batch test number tested by steadfast love labs I get a test number a test date 224 20 20 this is from one six eight zero market a vase City Michigan four eight 706 one Graham says activation time immediate but nowhere on this entire box does it tell me anything about percentages of THC so I'd have to look that up myself so I'm going to attempt to do that in a little bit and then I'll throw that in the description below you kind of see it in the shiny part it's a sativa and it's got the little little push button right here it's got the little weed logo poison control number we're gonna try to do this as easy as I can it was giving me difficulties earlier oh so this box reminds me of like the rogue watches that I see people doing reviews on I've never had one of those so I don't know anything about them other than I've seen packages from watching real man he smokes he did a lot of Rose cards so I've heard from the kids that I got these from but you know at the end of the day the salesman he's not gonna tell me something bad per se he told me that these are really good he enjoyed them every one he sold one to really enjoy them so we're just gonna get into this and formulate our own opinion pretty fruity on the on the dry head so you know it's got the the gold colored thread stuff in the mouthpiece the glass on the center just a seashell on the one on the bottom it says three when sea for three nine zero doesn't have the cush logo and it doesn't have the little fire looking symbol that the the Jupiter symbol or juniper one of the two I forget I kept saying Jupiter I think it's juniper um a little logo that they put on the bottom so we're gonna then turn this on nowhere on here did I see anything about bolts so we're gonna drop this back to the three point two that I usually run it instead of the three point seven for the Presto cards raise that up drop it down let's give this go and see what we got pretty tasty get a slight bit of that burn back here like you get from some cards usually I get that closer towards the end of a card or unless it's like a really earthy flavored one is sit back here or usually the coils burnt out and I'm getting like a real gross harsh flavor in the back of the neck throat I mean say yeah I'll say that's pretty tasty for being a company I've never dealt with before you know you get a little you get a little area because I don't want to pick up stuff like the myth next track ones that I got the one time that I didn't enjoy at all four flavors did enjoy them at all this one's actually not bad at all oh I'll have to wait and see you know just the type of high that it's gonna give me my eyes are watering a little bit I think I got something actually in this eye cuz I can feel it dry like up in here but yeah I would use this brand again I see no no reason not to now most are you gonna sit here and ask me hey how do you feel that these compared to say platinum based MK Church any of the other bigger named ones I would say this is it's not better than a lot of the Platinum vapes I've had this specific one um but it's right on par with a lot of the other platinum base I've had it I would say it's no worse just there's certain flavors and the Platinum vapes that I just really really like purple champagne purple pawnch Sunday driver galactic jack those were usually my top five I would definitely get this specific flavor again and I'm definitely willing to try this company a few more times the guy go through happens to have a few more these and I will do my best to get my hands on another one who's got cherry pie gelato blue dream is another one he's got but most of them are indicas and I was looking for a sativa at the time so that's why this one got chose blue dream he told me tasted really really good too so I may try to get my hands on that so one cuter boom super Lemon Haze you're on the channel can't wait to check out some all your products and give some more reviews taystee um so with that being said well try these if you can I can't tell you specifically that every flavor is good and every single car it's gonna be top-notch but as of right now one-for-one peace out guys like sub comment hit the bell for future videos and got a couple more reviews to do here in a little bit catch you guys in the next one peace out", "2Js-C1Xflj8": "[ __ ] uh we got the yokon unipro here and we got the the gt800 and to start off this hit this review we're gonna take a nice hit [Music] just take a nice hit of some regular distillate and cannabis thrive terpenes saw some pineapple express that was a nice flavorful hit anyway let's go into let's get into it so the reason why i call these the best batteries is because of many reasons let me let me let me start giving it off the top of my head so first and first foremost they conceal your battery that's i mean they conceal your car i like i like batteries that hold your hold your um your cartridge and keep it safe and stuff like that but you know you know those pen batteries that have no concealment you know i used to use those batteries but forget the concealment the functionality is actually what makes these batteries the best to me it really triumphs over batteries that i just showed like the vessel and and whatever [ __ ] because those are like you know three presets and that's actually okay for people you know there's no there's no there's no better or worse you know it's just what it is what it is but i just say that those have those have like three presets and you know you're very you have limited range while these have a lot so the yokon unipro when you look at the screen it shows the voltage and the ohm readage and seconds i guess that display how long you've been hitting your card for so i'm not sure how you can see that if you're hitting it but um at a two it goes lowers the 2.0 voltage and then it changes up in 0.1 increments all the way up to 4.2 volts and that's really really that's nice that's a nice range you know that's what i got this initially and i was like oh yeah i'm lit finally 2.0 voltage is lower than 2.5 but then immediately as soon as i got this i found out about this and i was like bruh what so this is the the the gt800 and i got it from qcell and they they sell the cheapest let me assemble it real quick so as opposed to the yokon pro it doesn't use this big magnet right here but i am going to i'm going to try the hit with that big magnet real quick and see how that does but we're going to load it and load it in and to me the unique thing about this uh cartridge is that it has this feature where well when you put it in as you saw how it acts to me for a new coil coil it detects its own it does the same thing as a yokan i think it just detects the the ohm readage of the of the car so that's it saying 1.51 ohms right now and as you can see the wattage is what i'm as well it's the biggest number here so it's like i change it by the wattage and the voltage is right there at 0.0 so there's this formula that i'm gonna have to probably put on the screen maybe eventually that relates all of this together and at 2.5 watts i'm at one point as you can see 1.94 volt and you saw the timer coming that's their timer so yeah so the whole reason why i like this more better more better yeah that's that's english is because it goes it has way more range like i said it changes it by the watts so if i go down the lowest is 1.0 watts and if i hit that to see the the voltage that's 1.22 volts like i did not know carts of a battery can go under underneath what's it called underneath the what's it called two i'm smack so yeah then the max as you can see i'm changing it let's see how let me see the per the per change per per wattage 0.1 so at 2 point at 4.4 watts we're at 2.57 and if we go up 1 to 4.5 we go to did i make that right 2.60 so that's a 0.3 change and then this is 2.63 another 0.3 change so it changes it in very in like small increments i've i've had a lot of changes so let's just keep going so the max is this the max i'm really going guy like i'm not going to hold you i've taken taking a lot of hits today so this is going to be a horrible review but the max wattage of this is 20 watts and the max voltage would be 5.2 whereas the lowest you saw it's like below two low ones so let's take a hit of it at like you know around 2.0 to to match the yokan hit that we took oh not even that let's just put them at 2.0 voltages and take take hits together and just see i'm not sure because i think the yokan has a weird heating mechanism that you have to just use i'm not sure if it burns oil faster i really don't know what it does so at 2.0 we're at 1.783 oh i'm not trying to go higher than that but let's see we're at 2.2 watts we're at 1.82 and at 2.3 we're at 1.86 2.5 1.9 let's go 2.5 1.94 2.6 1.98 so we'll say 2.6 over there i'm going to take this out and we're gonna hit it on the yokon and we're gonna put it to two volt to hit on the yokon first it's saying 2.0 volts at 1.59 ohms i'm not sure if that really matters if the homes even matters anymore because it's like if it's already two point 2.0 volt is 2.0 volts but i'll just keep that there and that's gonna take we're gonna take a 10 second hit let's go [Music] have a nice hit so now we're going to take i'm going to use the same the same magnet magnet for this experiment to see what's going on real quick so let me show you guys the setup so that's me for a new coil coil around the same ohms the voltage is going to be 1.98 so let's do this test [Music] performance is key so this one beats it in variable voltage um it has more preciseness more range better efficiency um better attack i can only say that the the yokan has better protection that's the only point it gets but yeah this is the liquid diamond sauce car we're gonna take ahead of this real quick we're gonna drop this down all the way to 1.0 watts to get the lowest voltage necessary this is the last hit i'm going to take of the video to show that this is a nice battery so we're at i don't know if you can see the arms i'm not trying to flip my camera this time but it's 1.43 ohms clocking in at 1.19 volts priming it up let's go i thought i was going to take a time to get ahead of that i don't know i should though [ __ ] i'm gonna do it you see the oh i don't nice um so uh yeah i like how the the the seconds is like down there you can i can actually see that's because before i wasn't counting but when i looked down i saw the second and it also stopped at 10 seconds so you're safeguarded so basically yeah that's it the the review of these the best batteries and um yeah as you can see uh yeah i gotta i gotta just get this video edited and just go go to work have fun guys", "-DLv-IvXmsU": "okay what's up youtube so if you're here today you're probably wondering how to transfer thc oil from one cartridge to another so you probably have like one broken cartridge and you're trying to get it into a cartridge you know works so you don't waste your money so i know a lot of you found me in the first place because of this video right here so here's the thing youtube took it down because all they said was that i violated their policy they didn't even explain why i didn't save this video unfortunately but on the page that youtube shows me my deleted video it lets me play through it i'm cartridge i have dispensary the other day and i'm re-uploading it now and so the quality is a little shitty because i have my phone recording my laptop screen basically so the quality is a little shitty but you'll get the gist um and i basically just tried to cut out the reason why i think youtube deleted the video so hopefully there are no problems this time because this video helped a lot of people so i'm gonna try to re-upload it now and hopefully we don't run into any issues all right you guys so i bought this [ __ ] brand new graham cartridge at a dispensary the other day and it doesn't work like i connected it to a brand new battery that i just bought and it didn't work so i tried it on my friend's battery it didn't work and i was like cool so i've been looking up tutorials on how the [ __ ] to fix this and nothing that i'm trying is working and i guess you can transfer the oil over i didn't know that so um i didn't spend money for no reason so i'm little miss [ __ ] i'm trying to not waste 50 [ __ ] dollars is makeshifting so what we're gonna do is because i already had like two of these a few things to mention step one um untwisting the cartridge doesn't work with every single cartridge uh the ones that i had in the video were happy stick and for the most part i got a lot of questions on how you actually remove the cartridge cap you just twist it that's it like it might be a little sticky because the oil but that's it you just twist it um and then make sure that you're wearing gloves so that you're not like so you don't burn your ham with the hairdryer i honestly think that youtube took my video down for a safety violation because there was some things i mentioned in the video that i didn't clarify and i think it got flagged for safety reasons and when i said wear gloves i mean rubber gloves like the kind i'm wearing in the video not like latex plastic gloves i mean like actually protect your hands gloves the kind i was wearing in the video are actually dishwashing gloves but that protects your hands so basically i heat up the oil and this one with the [ __ ] hair dryer and then i pour it into the one that actually works i haven't tried smoking it yet so we don't know if it's gonna work or not so stay tuned okay so you take the one that doesn't work heat it up once it gets to a consistency that it'll start moving easily and you grab your cartridge that does work kind of let this stuff start to fall and i just take it and let it fall into there okay so once i get it to like that point take the hair dryer again because that [ __ ] metal thing is in the way i guess one bright side to having to redo this video is that i had some copyrighted music right here even though it was hella [ __ ] funny but it's fine um now at least i won't have a copyright strike you specify this but your hairdryer needs to be on heat not cool obviously i thought that was a given but you never know um so now you can see the oil is transferring into the empty cartridge so it'll take you a couple tries to do this because you need to keep reheating up the oil but i'll be back after i like transfer it all over um and we'll see if it works all right y'all let's put the cap back on unfortunately i couldn't transfer all of it over but see i still got a good amount there which i got like half a gram which is [ __ ] annoying because i had a full gram but since i tried this twice already i lost some of my weed but it's okay all right and then i didn't actually feel like going outside to smoke to show you guys the after result because i can't smoke in my apartment complex so i would have to like go all the way like outside outside like far away from the apartments so not doing all that but it does work i swear by it i promise um this method is 100 solid so yeah so yeah thanks for watching i'm really sorry the video got deleted and i know this quality is probably shitty but at least i was able to get it back up for you guys i really hope youtube doesn't delete it again because i think i fixed the safety violations that it got deleted for um but yeah thank you guys so much for watching like comment subscribe i love you guys so much peace out", "WVnhfdr6j_o": "okay everybody this is a instructional video I recently had a problem my cartridge it wasn't burning my hollow I couldn't figure out why and I went online for an instructional video and found all these things about the plate nothing fixed it so I just there's this section right here where the smoke comes up the back of it I'll show you what to do you just take top off grab like a zip tie they're flat they're long and skinny there's a groove right there if you take you see it's going inside you push this all the way down sometimes the oil likes it get clogged up in the side of right here in the cylinder so you just start poking around in it turn on your pin and I've already done mine so I don't need to you just jam it around there a little bit it will get clogged up and you it's perfectly safe and you turn it on while you're poking it and it will start to clear up the clogged oil that'll fix your issue for you and get you burning and smoking again alright that's my video thanks bye", "pyBTL7GugHo": "removing the 12:25 only takes a couple minutes as always turn off the water at the supply source and drain any remaining water from the tap then remove the faucet handle cap or insert button be careful not to scratch the finish this will expose a screw which must be removed before you can pull off the handle assembly remove the handle dome and then take off the handle adapter along with the white plastic pivot nut use a wrench to unscrew the black plastic retainer nut pull out the copper retainer clip and pull out the cartridge with your pliers channellocks or a cartridge puller will also work wipe off any dirt or debris from the valve body then 12:25 cartridge has abdi washer that should be put on the cartridge stem prior to installation insert the new cartridge into the valve with the locator tabs aligned 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions this is important because if the tabs aren't lined up correctly water is blocked from flowing into the chamber it's also important that the cartridge stem is lined up properly one side has a vent hole and for kitchen and lab installations the vent hole should be in the 6 o'clock position the white twisting tool may help ensure the best positioning with the cartridge in place reinsert the retainer clip taking care to straddle the tabs of the cartridge to finish the job reassemble the handle adapter kit and faucet trim pieces and replace the handle cap or insert button along with its simple single moving part another advantage of the 12:25 is that it easily accommodates back-to-back installations normally faucets deliver cold water from the right and hot from the left when two showers or lavatories are installed on opposite sides of the same wall but share the same water supply it's called reverse polarity one side or the other will have reversed hot and cold functions the 12:25 makes this easy to correct you don't even have to turn off the water simply turn the 12:25 cartridge stem 180 degrees when the installation is complete you can be sure that Moens 12:25 cartridge will provide years of reliable service you", "1euLraw0SYo": "if you want a canvas patient or of age please fight off of this video yo guys what is going on ethan here today we are going to be showing you the funniest and one of the coolest battery cartridges that i've ever seen so we're going to be using the hamilton devices pb1 cartridge so this is it when it's not connected so i forgot exactly what cartridge is in here but all you have to do is screw it in put the top on like this and show you [Music] and then you just screw it in and there it is so to charge it you should see it here and you screw it out or not even scroll you just move it like that and it takes a micro usb and that is how you charge it so you turn it on with three clicks change it or turn it on five clicks change it with three and let's get into it we're going to be on the second setting here like i said how you open it is just like that and close it like that this is the hamilton pb1 device i'm going to be linking it in the description but let's go ahead and take it you're losing pretty strong stimuli so i don't have so i don't have the box with me right now i don't know where it is but it does come in like a clean leather box and it does look pretty nice so there's how it looks i'm trying to do like a whole 360 of it the back sides through a little logo if you haven't seen it and then like i said you just take it off by unscrewing it and just pulling it apart so it's really small when it's in this battery you can still have it if you want to you don't get the full device without this so you just put it in almost dropped right there screw it and there we go most devices will fit in this or most cartridges will fit in this device but [Music] that's one of the thicker cartridges and it fits in there so i did change how i'm sitting in this video and the camera angle is a little bit different so i do hope it looks a little bit better because i haven't even checked how it looks but i do hope i do hope it does look a little bit better this is awake and big it's early for me it's like 8 30 so it's pretty early i'm gonna take like one or two more hits i'm gonna end off the video like i said hamilton devices pb1 device also do have one of their ship devices that i'm going to show off i don't know if i'm having a problem with it or what so that's why i haven't made um a video on it i've had this device for like a month just been testing it out that's why i haven't made a video in so long take the last hit and upload here thank you guys for watching make sure you guys leave a like comment subscribe but this help out the channel thank you so much for watching and this is [Music]", "kQmL3zc2sOk": "hey YouTube how are you I hope you guys are having a good day and if you're not I hope by clicking on this video you're feeling a little bit better today's Monday okay and I'm back again with another cart review oh I picked up another cart that I have not tried okay I did take a couple of puffs off of it but I didn't like actually like experience everything so this is gonna be pretty exciting oh garden sky doggy and this I don't know um but this is an indica named live resin okay now I was like what is the difference between all the other cards and then the live resin like what's different about it well I looked it up online and I wrote my little notes down so I guess live resin an onion flower rather than a dried cured flower so I guess the other types of cards which are called dis lint or I don't know I don't know if I said that right but basically those I guess are made of flowers that's already been cured you know it's chilling and it's already dry so that's how they make their you know chemistry happened with those kinds and I guess what's live resin it's fresh frozen flower if that makes sense so I thought that was an interesting found the raw garden site because on the packaging you guys it has your little warning it has the manufacturer date the batch number and all that it tells me like the percentage right here on top of the sticker but yeah on here it doesn't say much it just says ingredients 100 percent frozen fresh frozen whole flower Turpin's and cannabis oil so those are the ingredients in this wax well card it says no trim no additives ever and that's all it really says and then it tells you like how to use it and the dosage you should take or whatever once you open it up so this is the inside of the box it just has like a little container where your cart sit so it's all box name inside of the box so that's cool and then in here is where it's all at and you push down and you open it sometimes I'm having trouble okay got it open yay okay so um in the thing that's what the color looks like okay this is beautiful it's so light it's just attractive you know it looks cleaner to me it feels more natural but that's just the color that's just me talking on the card of course it has a California sticker and then it has the raw garden and then it has their little symbol so on a symbol uh logo logo yes yes yes and then on the card screw on thing that you just take off once you're ready to use it and then it has a little top it this is what the mouthpiece is looking like okay that is the opening hole and then sort of those say is just you know regular white little tips screw her on and let's start this smoke stash I have not smoked today yet it's my first time yesterday I got really okay story time I got a little drunk okay and then I think I had three beers and I have well three beers and a half is too much for me I don't drink often at all rip and oh my god I was so sick you guys it's like I just started feeling really like woozy and like just tired and I was just not having fun anymore like I didn't want to be drunk anymore and I threw up like I was sitting in my car and I was just chilling first I went outside to catch some air you know I was with a couple of friends so I went outside to get some air all feeling better and you know you [ __ ] up even after you go outside and you don't feel better like the fresh air isn't helping it's not doing anything so I already knew what I was going into so I was just kind of walking around kind of like chillin then I just then I sat in my car and I was [ __ ] sick I just was like okay you know when you feel like you're about to throw up like it's coming you can't stop it it's coming it's exactly how I felt you guys I threw up I didn't throw up all over me you know I threw up outside of the car I have not smoked since then because I got so sick I came home I think I don't even think I took a shower but I laid down I slept I woke up at 12 I ate so I don't know how I survived but here I am okay it's website and I wanted to focus on some of the little facts that they have on there what they claim cuz like I said on the packaging it isn't much so I wanted to kind of tell you guys and also with the live resident another fact if focuses on maintaining is strong and pure flavor and honey I can totally agree with that because the first hit I took of this when I was leaving the dispensary oh my god like I was so freakin late I was coughing my ass off it was really pure like as far as the flavor it literally tastes like you got some like dab or like wax and you took an actual dab you know out of it Raik that's what it feels like it feels [ __ ] well now feels it tastes really good and the flavor is definitely very like weedy you know and another few few facts from raw garden so they claim they are a hundred percent natural farm-fresh cannabis so they only grow fresh cannabis they're not using stuff that's been sitting somewhere really grown plants so all of their flower you know that's extracted for their cards or their wax or their diamond saws there's so many different stuff from them it's all California cannabis grown in California valleys so if you guys you know support that I definitely do because it's like if it's a closed source it's more of it's not past past past no fillers and their product no added flavors and no additives and I [ __ ] with the no added flavors part because I don't really like the extra stuff just for it to taste better or something like I can care less but anyways I'm gonna stop rambling and we're gonna get lit and I'm gonna and I didn't bring a water what is she thinking amra all Gardens definitely gotta take little hits with this oh my god yeah yeah you guys I'm warning you okay if you guys are I'm telling you guys take little hits off of this when you first get it if you haven't tried one of these already because I have not tried this so I'm a whole new person to this you know it's a very it has like a wax taste okay like this is an indica sky doggy so do not expect a no type of light you know fruity stuff from guys like this is the flavor is like like I said I'm gonna tell you the flavor okay very very wax like that's exactly how I describe it I don't think it tastes like any type of fruit or any type of like you took a DAB and that tastes you have in your mouth but a good damn you know not a nasty not on whatever something you just whatever no a good clean wax tab out of a clean break that's how I would describe it okay had a terrible night yesterday though I [ __ ] fell asleep like my whole [ __ ] like it was turning out to be cool and I did a lot of stuff yesterday but as far as like I went to the grocery store then I went to the dispensary and then I think I ran like two more errands and that's after that is when you know somebody when I first went there I had positive thoughts I was like I'm gonna have two three beers and I'm just gonna drink I'm not gonna smoke and at first I didn't even smell them they were smoking at first okay and then you know it was fine I got drunk I got confident so but I did throw up it was fun being drunk I felt really faded but then I just pushed it pushed my own limit I knew I should have stopped when I should have stopped but yeah I mean other than that you know as far as what other flavors have you guys tried if you guys are watching this and because this should spider like I love it okay like oh and let's do that bubble test y'all like I don't think it's fake so if it comes up fast is it's it's a full gram so I feel like this should last me a while because I mean I barely take few hits and I'm high so like I said it's good it is an indica so I mean they probably have other flavors where you guys are at so it might be different stuff I don't know but as you can tell my voice is like recipe now because I'm a little high and you know this did it [ __ ] it did it [ __ ] nothing I don't know what else to really say about it but I definitely recommend it it was I think where I got it from 55 before tax and then would tax a little bit more so you know you do what you do as soon as I'm done filming this video I'm gonna go edit smoke some more you know is honestly let's do a rating one to ten what am I gonna give it once and for all it's a good 9 okay I'll even give it a 10 I just haven't smoked all of it yet and then I'll definitely tell you with an empty car to be like yeah what do I really think about it this [ __ ] hits but yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on what is your other flavor that you have tried that you recommended me trying let me know you know let me know but I'm gonna go because it is getting a little darker and I'm pretty much [ __ ] I don't know talk about hang out of 10 it it tastes like what it claims you know the no fillers no added flavors no additives it definitely feels like that it feels really like pure just Tacey [ __ ] pounds in your face baby hits baby hits you guys oh my god but I'm gonna go I'm gonna edit this video maybe smoke a bowl or whatever you know the huge the user dues but I hope you guys are having a good day and I hope this video made you feel a little bit better because it definitely makes me feel better making them and yeah let me know let me know well I'll see you in the next videos so you don't know anyways have a good day have a brighter day and have blessed day", "agukEpErewM": "hey what's going on everyone my name is josh also is wade funnies in today's video we're going to go ahead and review and smoke down on a black mamba cure cartridge over there from move florida as well as let you know my general opinion of the cartridge and the effects but before we get into the fun guys we had to take care of the business of course this is a medical marijuana review channel made by medical marijuana patient here in the state of florida for medical marijuana patients and those over the age of 18 to enjoy if you're under the age of 18 please exit the video what the [ __ ] are you doing here anytime you enjoy this video feel free to go ahead and smash the subscribe button down below if it's still red you ain't doing it right feel free to go ahead and give me a like and a comment let me know what you're smoking on where you got it from as well as go ahead and punch that notification bell up in the corner and you've been notified every time one of my videos goes live send a notification right to your phone on your laptop now that we got that out of the way everyone let's go ahead get into the phone like i said this is a move pure cartridge this is the black mamba strain we're smoking on today got some nice golden black oil in there golden uh yellow oil in there nice uh translucent this particular strain is a half gram cartridge over there from move florida like i've said 50 for the half gram black mamba is a indica the lineage of this parent of this strain the parents are unknown but thought to be uh gdp or granddaddy purple crossed with black domina or black domina and i think both those strains uh accurately represent this at least the uh granite purple of course it's very similar to that granddaddy perp uh with effects as well as uh taste particular thc in this batch is 430 milligrams per half gram cartridge or 86 percent and uh 1.8 cbd in this particular batch i'm glad move actually put the uh stuff there on the package i know it's backwards but black mamba they're up top 430 milligrams 0.9 and that's it's half grams 1.8 but yeah you got your vape pure there this particular batch was harvested and packaged uh this was june 8th 2020. now that we got that out of the way guys let's go ahead and get another rip in before we get some more information and uh go ahead get that out of the way we got your blunts your bongs your joints your vape pens whatever you do to get it nice and right get nice and medicated with me let's go ahead and get this cheers everyone the particular blood structure of this strain is said to be very dark green hard dense buds with purple and dark green leaves uh sugar leaves on those i definitely agree with that i've never seen the buds of this particular strain but from what i i can taste in the pictures i've seen online i definitely agree with that according to leafly it helps patients with stress insomnia and pain definitely agree with the insomnia uh the couple times i have medicated on this i've only done it a couple so far but um very sleepy definitely had it definitely holds true to those uh og uh what's it called og uh what am i saying og gdp genetics there they say this strain had me feeling clear-headed mellow i would definitely say it's a nice indica to have a conversation on or uh listen to some great music you definitely enjoy it we're gonna go ahead and get another room here guys cheers make sure you check me out over there on instagram on that platform the weed funnies all one word uh definitely check me out if you like stoner uh memes education as well as florida medical marijuana products zooms uh zoom in and pictures if you definitely uh enjoy that kind of content and definitely enjoy mine over there well if you're over there you might as well give me a follow as well as go ahead hit me in the dms i'd love to get to know some of the uh fans subscribers tell me how medical cannabis has helped you to treat your medical conditions and ailments as well as i'd love to know your medical cannabis journey and let me know what you think of the channel if there's anything you'd like me to uh review if i get my hands on it here in the florida medical market definitely like to review it let me know down there in the comments over there in the dms and instagram as well as over there at the gmail the weed funnies as well and you go ahead and get that gmail for any businesses quiet business inquiries if anyone has anything to uh they'd like me to share any brands or anything like that love to get on with you help you out as well as a new partnership that'd be great definitely enjoying this black mamba it got me really uh nice and mellow over here i feel it here the cerebral but that's mostly uh most pens but it's also the body high i'm definitely feeling here in my chest as well as melt it into this chair definitely it'll give me a nice nap or perhaps watch some uh some tv clutch up on some tv i don't know yet for fifty dollars can't beat it i like this a little better than that blueberry one i previously reviewed if you haven't checked out that blueberry cartridge review definitely go check that one out like just like this pure i believe i did that last week and for fifty dollars for the half gram here on that medical market that's not very not very bad competitive wise i should say for the price i mean i think the cheapest distance cartridge we have right now is either the 30 ones over there from one plant which i don't like or the 35 dollar ones pop azure cartridges over there from liberty health sciences i believe i believe those are the two cheapest but um yeah i think it's worth more to pay for those better terps as well as i think it's a little better quality distillate as well go ahead and get one more rip here cheers everyone i don't know if i said the smell and the taste on the strain um i would say it's sweet fruity and peppery in my opinion and that would be for the smell and the taste uh the taste the fruit in there i can't decide if it's citrus or grape in my opinion maybe a little bit of both but it reminds me of that granddaddy purple in uh no contest i would say i would whoever guessed that on the genetics i would say is pretty damn close i want to say this is named after that basketball basketball player kobe bryant that passed away i'm not sure though because they did call him black mamba don't quote me on that though this is a little bit stronger of a cartridge over there distance-wise 86 percent i'm liking that as well i think that last one i reviewed was i want to say 75 i'm not mistaken really good i've been enjoying this uh truly battery as well i've been only had to charge it a couple times i think i've charged it i wanna say twice now in the three weeks i've had it maybe four weeks the only thing i do hate about it is that magnet there on the bottom that metal piece is very strong with the mechanism there inside i think you can see that you gotta pull pretty hard i can't get a grip on it with my fingers i mean look how big that is i can't i can't get a grip on that i gotta use my shirt or some kind of cloth but besides that i like it all the same especially the little window here you can see how much product you have left it works out a lot you got just over just over half there all right in conclusion definitely enjoy this uh pure black mamba cartridge over there from move florida and uh definitely recommend it to indica lovers as well as people that enjoy i guess granddaddy purple you know or moved products moves dislike in general it definitely holds up to uh products and the consistency of uh what moves putting out over there go ahead and get one more rip here everyone and get out of your hair this is weed funny signing off spoke with me so good for your mama have a great rest of your day everyone cheers have a great day everyone sweet 27 now peace", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome back to our [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm all right child welcome back to another video but the video is gonna be a

yeah they did and the cookies does a little print they stole they they completely stole the cookies look but how i feel is delta a and delta nine is like delta nine big brother delta a little brother or maybe a little sister ain't number one in that sense like cookies is d9 and cake his d.a like cookie's a cake nah that's how i took you yeah he didn't like it he didn't like i ain't got a lot it's it i don't really have a problem with it no more because it's kind of like damn burner you ain't got a [ __ ] delta eight out yet so yeah someone's gonna steal your [ __ ] you should have been up on it why do we not have a cookie's delta eight sure period but we got the texas pound cake indica 940 milligrams delta a one gram cart it says on the bags got a little oh it was collected on december 16 2020. it's got the qr code on the back and everything the batch that this was made from was only 14 grams so you literally got one of 14 grams that was made for this that's pretty cool it's got a little cake seal i kinda like that crack this [ __ ] open got this love hate relationship i do i do it's a real love hey y'all don't don't judge me for my sailor moon shirt i don't give a [ __ ] they think yours is dope ah [ __ ] this is the ceremony used to be on all my uh notebooks and folders back in the day all right so i've heard nothing but good things about this oh it's the sticker i've heard nothing about good things everybody keeps saying how good it is and they had two different boxes for some reason one box was solid and then it was this yes and it was like the box like this is what a box like these was all like a cake line yeah and then the red box was like the other flavors and [ __ ] yeah but so far i kind of like the packaging though it's it's winning you over so we got [ __ ] this this trash now and i want to go ahead and say kate does not know we're doing a review on them no we just [ __ ] we gotta keep up with our subscribers [ __ ] is talking about it so we got to get it regardless if they [ __ ] with us i kind of like how it looks no lie it's got the clear windows on the side of it it's pretty cool i like that okay it's got a charging port so if you do find yourself low you'll be able to charge that [ __ ] up a little seal like the top is rubber right now it ain't yeah it's plastic it's a little look a little bit more a little rubber fits it better other ones you see and i got three little mouth holes i like that that's cool like a harmonica at the top now the texas pound cake i've never tried texas pound cake anything but you know it's crazy hold on though they cake starts with a c but the disposables got a k on it see okay let me see the box that's a little weird maybe they got the disposables made by somebody else just didn't have their logo on it well when you look up cake we tried to find that actual like company and get in contact with them to see if they wanted to work with us it was hard to even find anything about them everybody that sell these are like third-party sellers they're not coming from a direct site so when we look down there that was a thing you can see on the metal of gas stations yeah a lot of gas stations that's mainly we're already off back okay disposables i have some other disposables you pull it out it's literally just a plastic container like a little plastic square and some wires connected to it that's it this [ __ ] is like a real cart if you look on the inside you see the same filter and [ __ ] as a cart yeah you do so this is like i don't know if y'all gonna be able to see that [ __ ] yeah you're not gonna be able to see that that's the window but the window it's got an actual [ __ ] little piece of the metal [ __ ] stem like on the carts yeah all right so see what this tastes like he'll be [ __ ] me up when [ __ ] ain't got buttons oh what's that to look uh action was that satisfaction have you that's what you ain't answering me have you tasted texas pound cake no that tastes good oh it tastes sweet yeah it's like it tastes like a dessert yeah this is good and it it it's heavy you hit it hit you in the chest you hit it hit you in the chest i mean you feel it that [ __ ] tastes kind of good though okay yeah it's strong too strong a little light indicator on the bottom i just know you hit it oh [ __ ] yeah i like the slick look at that i like it too i think it's i think i ain't gonna remember we paid our money for this this is [ __ ] now i don't know if it's because we just been reviewing what we've been getting sick but we we paid our money for this because it was like it's no way because we're seeing it everywhere and it's pretty cool nearly 39.99 so it ain't that bad of a deal are bad we had to take a what's tonight but yeah i like it i like it so far so good i'd like

yeah hit us up so hit us up all right we heading out all dishes are not alike [ __ ] over here it hit me in my esophagus [Music] perfect", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "4wnbKm267Js": "all right so when the airflow is too tight and right now I'm on the air stick which actually really like this battery but when the airflow seems too tight sometimes you got a magnetic one of the things I would do is slightly loosen it it allows a little more airflow now at the same time I'll let you know on some batteries if you loosen it too much or the connector is kind of weird it just doesn't even hit at all but I've noticed on some when the earth was a little tight try loosening a little bit and sometimes you'll get that looser airflow better hit then you would there you go", "82sQQIQ-Nb0": "hello cheapest vape supplies

"FSI-zShYMk0": "hey guys Breanna here bringing you your first how-to video from a PC so we have had a lot of inquiries from you guys on how to initially set up your vape pen for the first time so today I'm gonna demonstrate that for you so when you get your delivery it'll come in a prescription bag that looks something like this and inside you should have a battery that'll come in a package like this and a cannabis cartridge of some sort which will be like this when you remove your battery from the packaging you will find two parts one will be this top part which is actually how you charge your battery and this bottom skinny part is going to be your actual vape battery so you'll go ahead and unscrew these two and your battery comes already with a fourth of charge so that way you can enjoy it immediately upon getting it at this point you should be ready to open up your cannabis cartridge and you will find it to look something like this every cannabis cartridge is going to have security coverings on it for safety reasons at this point you should have removed the safety covering on the bottom as well as your charger from the top and now we're ready to connect these you will just screw it in and you're probably curious how do you turn it on so there's this power button right here and it's important to remember that you will always click it five times when you want to turn it on or when you want to turn it off so 1 2 3 4 5 and when you see it light up like that you know you're ready to officially start vaping so you will put it up to your mouth and you will hold this button down wow you inhale and there you have it that's how you set up your vape pen for the first time so after you've been using your vape pen for a while you're gonna have to charge it and that's where this piece comes in handy you will go ahead and screw it in and then you can charge it by plugging it in to your average computer or into a cell phone block you might have lying around as always with any of your cannabis related questions it's as easy as a PC", "VZ1879gKHN8": "[Music] hey guys what's going on on baggage girl couch Queen and today I'm coming to you with another cartridge review now this one is from copper state say that I picked this up at Seoul flower dispensary my local dispensary here in Sun City now listen I'm gonna tell you something sunflower just opened their location in Sun City they did not come to play games with you guys okay they put all the dispensaries on notice I walked in there and they had like this trifecta deal like three you know three levels of deals first day you know your first visit you get like boku and then on every three visits your first three visits they give you this free yes yes they weren't playing games okay so this one I picked up this copper state forms actually they're I guess their form is in snowflake Arizona so it's local as well while I was there I also picked up a new bait a pin and this is from Moxie so I picked this up as well go ahead and get in here I picked up if you can see that DaVinci og all right so let's get in here and again free smoke right and let's get that in I'll tighten it and then I am twisted a little bit because you want to look or flow in there that's just me personally let's go one two three four five all right so it's it's blinking all right I'm gonna give it a little chance to to heat up a little bit but again copper state and let's see if I can there it is again that delayed smoke so these are stronger than flower so if you're a newbie please be careful like that was that was one puff and I think that's all I'm going to do maybe I'll do like a half a puff I don't know but you have to be careful with these because this isn't like flower you know if if I were to get like DaVinci oh gee like in flower form it would be anywhere I'm not sure but usually they're in the range from like 18 to like 20 something percent 25 24 whatever but this this is much much higher I'm talking almost 90 sometimes % so yes you do have to be careful with this so that you're not overdoing it because it's easy to think that you can just kind of sit here and puff up and you can't do that so this is like puff puff let's turn this off okay this is something that you can just continue to puff on let's see it's just still lit and that is it for me I'm done and I'm serious I don't play games for this because I have overdone it in the past if you see some other videos when I first started I was a newbie and unfortunately for me somebody suggested vaping as a newbie I know right crazy and it was not I did not have good days or good nights for a long time and I didn't know why I was really sick so like I said be careful on that again I I just don't sit and puff I just really don't so that was what 1 plus 1/2 puffs me and I'm done but it's very good now I like the the straight THC like this carts just I do not like the flavors and I had to learn I did you know when I went and I got some the cartridges you know they were like strawberry whatever pie or something I don't know but for me the flavored cartridges tore my throat up and I was like gagging and it was really bad for a while so when I do do the cartridges I will do something like and copper state this is a really good one okay you're not gonna get like the flavor that you normally would get with the flower or the flavored ones but if you're you know for if you're doing this for pain relief you know any of the other medical medical reasons or if you're just doing it to get high this will get you there and this will get you there quickly okay so again copper state this is DaVinci og and this is good this is yes for me I like BAE pants because they're so convenient but you know in general if you watch my videos you know what I prefer so anyway thank you guys for watching thank you for subscribing and I will see you guys later bye [Music] you [Music]", "ia6D2bYffEQ": "what I put up your boy RORO coming

pen let's get it on here for the bio Jesus liquid live resin like I said I had two co2 that was pretty good this is the liquid live resin let's give it a rip it's a subtle flavor mmm but very pleasant very pleasant yeah very subtle kind of humbling Lendl in the wall lima bean a little bit of mersin and the other one I can't even yeah fresco by oh Jesus cartridge by Cresco by oh Jesus is the strain there's an indica instead I did have looks that I had this before but I figured it was one of the nicer better carts on the menu today and they didn't have a lot because they're getting hit hard like I said that line was all the way down around the block and people were still coming in as I was leaving like you mean the line was still the same place it was one that started it took me I got there at 11 I got inside about 11:40 about a 40-minute wait outside I got inside it was another I want to say 10 or 15-minute wait inside and then till I got to the cashier a budtender or whatever so it was almost an hour probably altogether nuts man this coronavirus [ __ ] has got everybody [ __ ] Cheers that's nice oh yeah pretty tasty this is what I'm having for tonight some buy oh Jesus indica buy Cresco let me know if you guys had some bio Jesus before and I'll let you know a little bit more about what I thought in the comments section or maybe I'll do the two part video and give you the empty cartridge and what I thought at the end case you know something goes bad to taste gets nasty throughout or you know because when these sometimes any smoker cartridges it tastes good at the beginning and then it gets like a burnt taste or it starts messing up or something so we'll see we'll come back with a second video and give you the after a day of smoking it or so and it's almost down to the bottom I'll come back with a and I'll have it stitch the two together through the power of video so it'll be like a second for you guys but yeah so let me get another rip of this it's pretty good I'm starting to feel it mmm by oh Jesus by Cresco nice flavor it's real subtle it's not like an overwhelming like Moxie has a real good you know pungent some of those are like that crest go island sweet skunk is like that it's got a real strong flavor what other one I could think of this got a real pineapple Express it's got a real boom right off the this one's real like a mellow flavor it's not you could taste it a little bit of beach not mercy and you can't taste that really at all I'm glad but yeah there you go that's it I'll bring you the second part of this video and day or so when I'm down put this down maybe tomorrow I'll you know or so no maybe not maybe I'll just upload this video today because I like uploading them the same day the cartridge is probably going to be good I've never had a problem with Cresco cartridges and I think I'm high because I'm rambling so I'm gonna upload this today so you guys can have a video to watch tonight here on YouTube peace I'm out rambling this [ __ ] has hitting me 81 percent THC for this total and yeah I feel it already what I do about 3 or 4 rips yeah I'm feeling it peace I'm out", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "akyKHTB0qH4": "[Music] let's go youtube ministry boy man fellow signing him back with another video today I'm at Windy City cannabis it is a dispenser that sent home word you got to pick up a couple parts get wedding cake and I'm also about to grab our train Hayes or something like that but I'm gonna go grab two carts and then on my door review like usual although swaggy this way Corin C&I are some people like super cautious steel stick another wine but it's not as bad as when we go ahead last night he is why it shouldn't be much of a late a wait they got it like a little thing going on right now when you just you order online and then you get a time where you come pick it up at so I'm here at my time right now to pick it up I got the cards this is Ronald like I said wedding cake I'll just do some b-roll but another one ghost train hey that's what I got ghost train Hades I know something but I think welcome got like 81 percent to eighty seven percent I got both of them it was overall pleasant experience with the city Canada so give it like two thumbs up pretty simple I know this really fight doesn't matter to other people in other states it should like that because they're dispensaries aren't like that they don't operate like it's a banking [ __ ] but out here in [ __ ] Illinois act like the Spencer is our bank and you know there's like a security door behind a security door behind another security door what is good YouTube and we're back like I said I just got back from Windy City cannabis right now I got so this is what I miss using to smoke this is not a really cheap doesn't cost much at all pay my five bucks for it like I said ended up getting two carts I got like I said got wedding cake and the guy goes try and I used about 500 milligram how finally just short of what I usually do but this joint called and they don't costing me 65 on top of that I ended up paying my 75 attacks in other words so and I know what in other words robbery bro this is it right here waiting cake do some b-roll [Music] [Music] again this is Verano now use this sticks hit this [ __ ] that's that join us is it right here or on tone beep anyway this little thing screwed a [ __ ] in here reason why I got this one in particular could this convene I could just stick this in my pocket I'll take it with me looks to go it's smaller but yeah hey slow bro it's a smooth pen I just probably last me a month I use mine tickling too however they have much for you as far as like a player for flavor program which I taste this [ __ ] one more time I can't really taste much out of this I'm not really getting like a cake taste oh no matter like look up and let you guys know like whether that actually works I don't really taste nothing cake wise as far as like wedding cake but uh I do feel something is usually pretty instinct with cars it's just like this literally just like smoking flour which has been my experience still early just like smoking flour so yeah I just be starting to feel some already that first day I took what was pretty was pretty damn massive but yeah and that man I'm gonna let you guys know I like I said hey buddy taste it tastes just a bit sweet but I outside of that any taste nothing I'm for real but eighty percent THC it is a hybrid I saw an indica and sativa and yeah other than that miniature boy man I appreciate you guys supporting the content two channels still steadily growing steadily growing and I'm just nothing but appreciated appreciate it to you guys and I've been in my experience that Windy City cannabis I give it two thumbs up as far as like I had like a bad experience I went to security guard but outside of everybody was cool most people was cool just like one little bit it didn't really blow it I still recommend though they're cheaper than the ones are that's gonna say that cuz they have yeah overall great experience I give this to thumbs up with them filling it for sure outside that man should I pick although I'm out under that this pan yo and I feel like my face is melting off right now", "iFzR9tPh1XE": "Hi All,  I'm just gonna go over how\nto pull the center coil back down in a Trulieve ceramic cartridge.

channel my name is shaka and i'm back here for another video boys what's good how y'all doing i hope everyone's having a good ass week so far man uh i just got off of work you feel me had a change into the x shirt had to go pack a little bowl real quick but today today is not about weed guys today isn't about flour i mean it's not about wheat today is about weed but today it's not about flour guys today is about carts and i haven't tried a new cart in a long time guys something new and today i picked up a cart that i hope is good it's called legion of bloom i'm gonna take a bong rip before i get into it but your boy he has to find a good spot to chill at smoke at get a nice little view you feel me give y'all a view and show you guys if this legend or legion of bloom is actually pretty good so let me sit down for a second yo so we're here so like i said before guys [Music] you guys know i like taking bong ribs we back to that bong grip in the beginning of every video if you guys have been um long subscribers with me you guys know that i used to take a bong rip like before every freaking video so cheers guys [Music] whoo damn it's just some good i got some good outdoor with me right now my outdoor is actually not that harsh the taste isn't that bad i mean it does taste like that outdoor it's not that bad it's not that harsh on my lungs guys but um we're not here about flour guys we're here about balloon [Music] so off jump guys man it says the monarch premium vape cartridge it's a hundred percent derived terpenes it's a distillate cart guys but it's cannabis derived terpenes and these terpenes also are sullivan less terpenes so they're not made with butane or whatnot and then also on the back it says on the ingredients it says triple refined cannabis oil i'm not sure what that means if anyone knows what that means please comment down below i would love to know what that means i'm wondering if it's like alcohol when you distill alcohol over and over so it gets less you know less strong and less like more burn on your throat and like it's more distilled kind of you know more premium so the strain that i got i got one grammar it's mendo breath and i'm gonna be real guys they are good with their packaging i like their packaging it's a nice package you just slide it up and then it also comes with this little card let me give you guys a close-up real quick here we go all right guys so it comes with this card and it says that they won the emerald cups first place in 2019 for their distillate cartridge and then in 2019 they also won third place award for their dislike cartridge so i guess they won two awards during the emerald cup one with the first place and one was a third place so their stuffs are pretty pretty good you should be able to scan them and look it up online maybe i'll do that later i'm not sure but yeah guys the oil looks freaking magnificent it looks closer to like a um to a raw garden the heck yeah guys bro i ain't gonna lie so far this legion of bloom it looks fire as hell i can't even front it looks like it's gonna be a good cartridge for me [Music] comes in a little too and also guys these cartridges are good because they have ceramic coils so it's you're getting less of that metal when you're smoking and you're getting that metal near your lungs from all those other coils that are made out of metal and whatnot these are actually made out of ceramic um made with ceramic coils and um a good brand for ceramic um coils i'm pretty sure is an avd cart but i looked on the bottom of this uh the bottom of this already and i didn't see any brand name but they do say that it's a ceramic coil inside so boom [ __ ] looking nice and gold so let's put it on a cart let's see what it tastes like man let's see what it tastes like but let me look at that see this is the raw garden it's a little bit darker than the raw garden but it's down there similar let me take a hit of the raw gardens real quick nothing beats a raw garden man that beats rawguard we're gonna take the rock garden off we're gonna put the bloom on and they actually have a logo on on the cartridge it's actually pretty nice they put a lot of thought and effort into their cartridge so we're gonna see if they put the same thought and effort into the actual oil to see if it's actually good guys all right all right so usually guys i don't like distillate i don't like distillate cards the only distillate cards that i really like are like sauce carts and stizzy carts those are the only distillate type of carts that i do like and sauce carts they're a little bit different because they add different type of terpenes to it and what not to make it a sauce cart but off a jump this actually reminds me of raw garden this i don't know man this and raw garden are pretty dang similar guys let me hit this one more [Music] time yeah i can definitely taste it tastes like a raw garden earth like you know you got that raw garden that's sweet you know the fruity fruity raw garden but this this one tastes like that earthy that earthy raw garden it's actually pretty damn good i can see why they won the emerald cup now this is actually pretty damn good it's surprising that not a lot of people actually i don't not a lot of people made videos about this i've been looking up seeing if people made videos about it not a lot of people made um videos about legion of bloom shout out to legion of [Music] bloomberg [Music] but yeah guys man i definitely recommend this it's actually a pretty damn good cart i'm actually gonna keep this one on the battery for a little bit you know what i'm saying yo i hope everyone enjoyed this freaking video don't forget to like comment subscribe man it was just a little car review i just had to throw you guys a little car review because your boy picked up and whenever i pick up guys i just want to give you guys a car review show you guys the new things that i that i purchased because you know i like taking risks and i like trying new things you feel me and like um i don't know i'm usually a normally a live resin guy but today we're going to try we got the the distillate legend of bloom and i'm also thinking about trying the new stizzy they have a noose dizzy strain i have to try that um so we're probably gonna get a stizzy soon i'm not sure when but it's coming guys because i know a lot of you guys in the comments wanted me to um do us dizzy so we're gonna do a stizzy a lot of other cocktail cubby guys i'm still trying to do a late night sesh i gotta get another late night session i gotta get a a nature session but i'm also gonna try and make sure that at least once a week guys um i'm gonna give you guys at least a story time because i don't know that it gets back to that um i don't know back to that old school youtube vibe where you just like smoked and you told the story like i feel like that's what a lot of we tubers back then used to do and you know now it's a little bit different there's a lot more reviews and you know challenges and things like that but i love that you know that aspect of just sitting down and it's just like me and you together just sitting here smoking i'm telling stories like i'm talking to you guys you know what i'm saying and we're just chilling smoking and vibing like you're my actually my freaking homies you feel me so thanks for

felt alone so i hop in my car push button start i dream every day as i look to the stars spilling my heart while i'm spitting these bars so", "VthK8TnAf3s": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] your was popping is your boy mr. THC man I'm back at it with the banger now look you guys this is gonna be part of my cheapest versus most expensive series where I go to different dispensaries and I try out different products right so last time I tried out flower I got the cheapest eighth and the most expensive eight in Washington State today I'm in Las Vegas so I visited planet 13 which by the way if you're in Vegas and you have to choose between reef and planet 13 I highly recommend you go to Planet 13 I felt like it was a way better dispensary they had a lot more options it was a lot more open and you were able to really move around and look at everything they had I went down there and this time I decided that we're gonna be reviewing their cheapest versus the most expensive cartridge now before I show you the product I just want to give him an understanding of how much everything came up to okay so for the half gram the most expensive half gram it was priced at $100 before tax right now I bought let me see how many items you got we got one two three four or five how about five items here that I bought and it was $55 in taxes so let's just give it you know let's just say that every item had $10 tax to it right just the same so that means that that $100 half gram is now 110 dollars because of the tax not to mention that this half gram didn't come with the battery so I had to buy a 15 dollar battery now the fifteen dollar battery doesn't really have a ten dollar tax to it but just because I'm dividing up the total tax that I was charged for everything that I purchased I just thought that I would throw it in there and had another $10 to the battery to substitute for the tax so now we're at a twenty five dollar battery and that a hundred and ten dollar and a half gram so that puts us at a hundred and thirty five dollars in total tax included battery included cartridge included with a half gram which is really pricey if you ask me and for the cheapest cartridge it was fifty five dollars which was a disposable cart which means that he already came with the ability for you to use it you didn't have to buy the battery on this I was fifty five dollars but now adding the $10.00 tax that I might need to all the items it was about it $65 cartridge right there now this is pretty expensive this is a Las Vegas prices I know Cali would have been wait jeepers like never in my life have I paid over $100 or even a $100 bro for a half gram of distillate like what the hell because I'm pretty sure this is just a little right I don't think it doesn't say anything about like live resin oh it is live resin my bad so not for distillate its life resin but still man this is an expensive cartridge right here you guys so this is what the expensive one looks like right here it comes in this fancy box which I'll give it to them I mean at least they you know they message some of that money that they're charging for this product into the way that the box looks now I'm gonna break down for you guys the whole entire like THC percentage etc etc you know what I'm saying so so the THC percentage test at eighty two point 61% CBD is zero there's no that there's no CBD and there there's cbn 11.1 total terpene so the terpenes is actually like the flavor profile to your product right it's gonna determine how the product tastes and all these flavors and aromas also play a role into how the high hits you so the terpenes are actually really really important this has an eight point zero five percent terpene base which is really hot especially for a live resin so this is supposed to be really gas that's actually what you're paying for when you're buying this product you're paying to get more trips to get more flavor and more quality out of your high and since it's life present it's gonna give you a way better higher than the distillate I personally hate hitting distillate man like when I first started I just I didn't know any better so that's just what I would do but after trying like the life resident I was just like all bro you can't go back to just regular distillate now look I'm gonna open it up and show you guys what it looks like when you open it a little box in here you see that boom Wow what look at that you guys it's like sick now they have their logo right in the front it's crazy because the guy at the shop was like just smell it smell it oh my god it smells so good it just smells like strong strong concentrate now if we look at the back of the box once it opens up that's how it opens this is what the inside of the package looks like so they're talking about the philosophy provide only world-class cannabis products for customers our state-of-the-art production process utilizes THC distillate and cannabis derived terpenes coupled with premium hardware is simply unmatched this technology consistently delivers an unparalleled vaping experience where elegance meets perfection hmm okay so again 110 dollars right here after tax 15 dollars but since we divided the text evenly do all the five items that I purchased we're gonna add another ten dollars to it and just say that it was a 25 dollar battery after tax 135 dollars right here now I was told that this battery was already gonna be charged and ready to go I believe this is Planet Thirteen's like the branded batteries that they have there we're just gonna go ahead put this on here and take off this top rubber piece now before I go ahead and try this project I'm actually gonna open up the other product that we got and talk about the cheapest wax battery that we got so this is roots I got the cush mango and this one I have a believe all the testing for it I got all the testing right here so mango Kush oh you know what I'm so sorry on the last one oh I did tell you guys the TC percentage tripping I'm high you guys I'm already late alright so for the mango push this one tested really high in THC percentage so THC tested at ninety one point ninety seven percent again this is the cheap one this is the $55 sixty five dollar after tax cartridge right here okay um let me see CBG which I really don't know exactly what that cannabinoid is and test that twenty four point forty nine milligrams look at the terpene percentage though the terpene percentage is at one point zero three so basically this one has eight times the terpene profile than this one so this should make for a way more better quality experience and high but this was more convenient you know this one is just you open up the package right pure and simple you got everything right here in the back okay now when you open up the package this side right here is empty I don't know why but everything is on this side so you can just like use your finger to you know slide bad boy out there oh now it comes like this right you just pop this open and you're ready to go wow that feels good at the finger okay is this what is this what is this okay so roots this is I know these are disposable but why is this like this I don't think that you guys is logo this is basically their local you guys look look at this I don't think you guys just logo should be able to come off that easy I mean I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant to happen like that I'm gonna just put it back for sure it's meant to look like this but first impression mm-hmm you know but yeah guys here you have it to my left side we have planet 13s cheapest babe cartridge that's disposable so you'd have to worry about buying a battery and to my right side their most expensive premium $100 bro 110 after-tax 135 after we add everything up with the battery 65 over here on the Left what do you guys think would you spend over $100 on a oh you guys say [ __ ] that I'm spending $65 after tax out the door and now I don't got to worry about the battery I'm just don't listing away what I'm doing I don't know hey guys we're gonna have to taste them and really see how we feel about them we're gonna go ahead and start off with the roots all right let's go ahead and give this thing a shot now we're gonna try to complain I really want a good to flower look we're gonna do a blinker out of them and if we're gonna do like you know shorter pause and we'll do longer pulls we're kind of play with it a little bit to try to actually get the flavor flavor you know put it down for a second I was like what does it think don't blink Wow dude the room just got foggy my eyes bro my soul left my body okay that was strong that 91 percent THC dude it's different however though it reminded me of like when you hit a dirty Punk no offense I'm not trying to talk [ __ ] you know what I'm saying because wasn't that bad okay hitting a dirty bomb it's a lot worse but I still reminded me of just like when you take one of those rips that just leaves your throat oh you know tasting all nasty and [ __ ] I think that I got really hot too like the disposable battery it took a really long pull so I kept I was feeling like the mouthpiece getting hotter and hotter so maybe it was a little too hot for the product so now we're gonna try small pools medium pools and longer pools to get the flavor out of those but I need to get some water bro god damn alright so there's been a solid ten minutes right off the bad guys the flavors wasn't there dude like I'm sorry you guys can improve on the flavor you know what I didn't write this thing just to lit oh this is hash oil posh this side of that let me see and this is the mango cush I believe is what this train is called the other strain cold it's called medicine Chloe I believe is with this one here is called a hundred percent pure cannabis oil no additives no fillers no synthetic terpenes okay so maybe that's why it has that flavor because it doesn't have faked our booth actually it's obviously pretty good cuz fake Terps or [ __ ] you know you don't want a bunch of fake Terps like dis lis it's just a bunch of fake chirps but it says it's hash oil I don't know is that like I really don't know all right but this is its hat it's premium hash oil so the other one is like resin let's take a short poll and see I'm saying a couple straw polls and just see how like it tastes and stuff yeah I mean now that I hit it more the flavor isn't really what's off-putting I think it's more like it's just a very dry throat it tries to throw up quick we take like a medium part of it man but you know what gets you so bad bro I started to explain something to my go downstairs and now saying all kinds of things well always like do so look the highest am i high is no joke this is not this isn't for rookies right here bro still knock that ass out you know you guys $65 brothers a good bang for your buck for real now I want to take like a longer pool just to see at what point I feel like it's you know it's too much or it just makes your throat too dry or whatever yes definitely with like the bigger pools that it leaves like that burn and your throw afterwards you know maybe it's just like the temperature because I'm just something that longer you're hitting it the harder it's getting because it's just on and more consistent you know but median to small hits on this thing is to go to to enjoy and if you're just trying to get like super medicated I guess like you know a long a long rip will do it for you oh I am eight to 10 out of 10 I'm out of 10 for real and I was the cheapest one now we got you guys the medicine Chloe and the medicine is spelled like M EDI Zi it's full of fun easy all right I guess we gotta turn it off with the blinker just like we do the other one so cheers you guys Wow there's some of the cleanest I've ever tried I'm hurt I'm hurt I swear by the end of this video I'm being so sleepy hi guys so the flavor was phenomenal it's like when I coughed it didn't burn my throat so I kind of like thought it was like what what my throat didn't burn it tastes crazy I don't even know how to explain the taste it tastes like when you hit a really really clean joint with some good flour you know and you just hit it and you just tasting the flour me like damn this flowers clean and the flavors on point that was crazy yo what the hell damn I'm up to highs on for myself don't be like here babe you have this one it's kidding all right let's take a small rip a medium rip and then a long rip I'm really excited for the small ring because it tastes so good Wow you know it's crazy and I don't know why this is what it tastes like to me but it tastes like a lemon raspado which is like just Google that little hemming dress bad I'll put a picture you you know what I mean that's what it tastes like it is delicious who this TT is crazy I don't know I mean this is more for like the premium smokers you know I guess this is more for like the people that are like I need quality every single Hey which I understand yo cuz even though the THC percentage is lower you're still gonna get just as bait you just gotta hit it maybe a little bit more but every hit can it be more enjoyable so it comes out to like some people might rather be like buggy I don't really care if the taste isn't as a1 as long as it gets me more late which I'm not saying this one won't get you more loot to this because you just got a pie smoked out of this a little longer but the quality of it I mean you're ingesting into your body so I guess at the end of the day you gotta make decisions sometimes young but I think it would be worth paying a little extra to go for like quality but that's just my preference medium pool do like the flavors still consistent and it's crazy how these trips like play a role with your mouth huh pause right they like they don't dry your mouth up you know I feel like this is over the battery it would get hot really quick and dry my mouth up now I'm not sure if it's also because it's a disposable that the quality might be a little different on the battery I'm not sure you know but dowsers my experience I'm gonna take a long pull out of this I'm so baked I feel like all right it's gonna pull down this fire this fire so I would definitely say they're both really good products because at the end of the day even though this one doesn't have like the best flavor in the world it gets you so big I was like baked out of my mind earlier what this was like uncomfortably be do you know what I'm saying this one however gives you a better experience like it's more premium it's probably way better for your lungs and it just tastes better all around I feel like the high is really good and the more you hit it too higher you're gonna get so it's really up to you what you want but yeah your boy mr. THC if you guys enjoyed this video because you got smash that like button let me know what you guys want me to do next on this series cheapest vs. most expensive out", "NOl3lkgTT-Y": "yo what is going on everybody this is weed them boys on the we dem boys Channel I'm here bringing a tutorial on how to unclog your vape pin this goes with like any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "GlxbV8OprWU": "hey

yo peace now let me know what you guys are smoking on of course down in the comments section have a great weekend happy Saturday here in Erie peace", "LfdsaO34phE": "hello everyone and welcome to my channel I am low to describe and today I'm gonna be talking to you about a product that I have here that I have been using for a little while now I have been using CBD products before and they have helped me and so I decided to try this brand this brand is called just CBD and the these are their Signature Series cartridges the one that I have right now that I am currently using is the pineapple express this is a hybrid cartridge it says so right here on the label and another one that I have been using is the is the Sour Diesel this is one of those sativa cartridges they come in this clear plastic container with like a cork top so I think that's pretty nice that they do that this is how they actually look right here so this is the full-spectrum container this is glass right here and it comes with this pretty awesome wood tip and I shall see that right there how it looks and I have been using it with this vape pen its BIOS if y'all haven't heard of that brand or I'm sure that y'all have heard of the brand it's very good very reputable brand it comes with a that you can set the voltage down here at the bottom and you can choose which voltage you would like to have it as so with me I use CBD products mostly for my depression in my anxiety I also use it to calm my nerves whenever I feel stressed out or in a stressful situation I have used Lazarus naturals before the only thing with that is with that one it kept me up at night and then I did you CBD MD and that helped me as well and so I decided to try these out since I have been tired more tired lately and so I decided to try the pineapple Express and the Sour Diesel since the pineapple Express is a hybrid cartridge and I read on there it is a 60% sativa and a 40% what's a 60% sativa and a 40% indica and they're Sour Diesel is a sativa so they have lab reports on their cartridges and they also have lab reports on other products that they do have that y'all can check out so with these with the Geist CBD brand the cartridges they have another one also so they have the sativa the Sour Diesel the hybrid pineapple Express and they also have another one called Northern Lights now Northern Lights is an indica as for more of like whenever you want to relax more of you can use it before bedtime to help you sleep I haven't tried that one yet but I'm going to be trying that one soon enough I might get it later on today or tomorrow I have to see if I have time to actually go purchase it but these two cartridges that I have here they have been really helping me out lately with giving me more energy with giving me more of a positive outlook because usually with my depression I was given by the doctor antidepressants to take but I haven't taken those yet because I would like to try more natural stuff before I actually take antidepressants so I have been doing my research on what products to take I have been doing my research on on the different terpenes on that health depression and different terpenes that help would get more energy more activity more focused and so far these have really been helping me this brand has really been helping me so far and I'm gonna try there like I said I'm gonna try there indica Northern Lights and then also with this whenever I take a hit from it it is like the smoothest inhale I have ever taken from from a CBD brand it is like very very smooth on the throat does not irritate the tro does not irritate the lungs these two that I have they come in 200 milligrams CBD and it's 100% u.s. grown hemp has a right here on the label and also it has it on their website and like I said before they have lab reports on all of their products so y'all can check their products to make sure how much CBD or you are getting how much what the terpenes are that you are getting I highly suggest this brand I bought these out of my own money so I'm not endorsed I'm not a paid by them or anything and I don't have like a affiliate link to use I have just been using these out of my own interests and out of my own for my health to help me get better and so that I can do more one thing that I want to let you know that I have talked about in my other CBD products reviews is that with any CBD product there if you have to take a drug test there is a possibility that you come out positive for THC depending on your on where you work if they drug test you or if they don't there are people or companies that say like on here it says zero percent THC I'm not sure if you I can see that zero percent THC let me show the other one actually they have recovered up but it says zero percent THC on it and so whenever it says represent THC that is 0% basically it is under the amount that's that's not legal it's under the amount that's that's detectable for THC on the lab reports that they done but there have been cases in a group that I follow on facebook called CBD oil users I highly recommend y'all check it out if y'all can but on that group that I follow they have been cases where people have said that they took a drug test from their job and they came out positive and they ended up having to lose their job because they thought the product was you know the people told them it was zero percent THC you're not gonna be show up on a drug test and all that but you can on any CBD product you can show up on a drug test because over time it accumulates in the fat cells and it also depends on your metabolism and each person is different they're having people who have been on CBD for like a year and they have not come out positive and there's people that have been on CBD for a month and they have come out positive so it each depends on the person but as for these the gist CBD brands the pineapple Express in the Sour Diesel the taste I don't know if it's just me but they taste very similar but that just could be my taste buds I'm still you know China deciphered the flavor it's they taste to me more of like floral what do you type but that's just me and my taste buds and on what I've tasted so far there is another CBD product that I have been taking that our review next time and I just wanted to show you all these these ones that I had I bought these at my local smoke shop they had a very good reputable reputable brands that I seen these were $34.99 for each one and I would think that it's worth it because of the way that they look the way that the glass and the full-spectrum is and also comes with this really awesome tip one thing that I do get to say though that I didn't like about them it could be the shop itself on and on how long they had the product or it could be the way that they are packaged but when I first bought the my first cartridge which was this one it was gunked-up at the bottom it was gunked-up at the bottom and I'm not sure if you I can see these little holes right here but they were like black and I'm guessing because maybe the CBD oil with the conduit it just got clogged up and so when I went to take a hit and nothing came out so I had to go back I got another one that looked like this like they had the black and nothing came out of that one either until we found one that was clean one that was clear and I made sure with this other one to make sure that it was clean and clear and I took a hit from those that let me test it before I took it out to make sure that the product was working well and it was and since I've got these it's just been phenomenal so me personally I suggest y'all try it out if you want to like I said next time I have another product that I'm going to be reviewing by funky farms and so hopefully y'all stick around for that one so with these the pineapple Express the Sour Diesel and then the Northern Lights by just CBD and I also suggest checking out their website I'll put the website in the link in description down at the bottom so that y'all can check it out but if you are having any problems like let's say tired anxiety the or any other symptoms that you can find on the on ano zone there is CVD that might be out helping CVD can work for you or it cannot there are lots of products that are out there and it just takes time to find the right product that y'all are looking for I highly suggest if you are getting maybe like discouraged or anything don't give up on trying the product don't give up on on find the right one because whenever you find the right one it'll make a world of a difference thank you for sticking around and listening to my review on just CBD on their Signature Series vague cartridges and hopefully I'll enjoy talk to you later", "a05QXghlnrE": "We're gonna do a breakdown of the OHM\nvaporizer battery and kit. So to start off with, you have your battery, which comes\nin this lovely box. It comes with an instruction manual and a charger cable\nfor your OHM vaporizer. Now start off we're gonna put it together by\ntaking the cartridge out of the kit. So when you buy a vape pen you're\ngonna keep the battery but the cartridge is the part that you replace. This\ncontains all of the cannabis distillates that you are going to vaporize. So you take off these little protective covers and then you're just gonna screw the\ncartridge in like this. Make sure it's nice and tight Not too tight and then\ntap this battery five times and it'll turn ON So you can see here that this\nscreen shows you a number of different things. This is your battery life your\nvoltage your wattage and the ohm's. Most of you aren't really going to need to\nknow anything about this other than tap the button three times and your settings\nwill change. They will go from more or less powerful depending on what you turn it to. You can see the wattage is going up and down. So it'll really be up to\nyou to start playing around with it and see what you like. So great things about\nthis battery, first of all, this is what is called a 5-10 standard connection\nThis will work with 95% of vape pen cartridges on the market. That means\nyou can put on your OHM vaporizer cartridge or if you like another company you can use theirs as well and sub them out The other great thing about this pen,\nwhich is very underrated is the pass-through capability. So it charges from the bottom here, which means that you can actually use it while you're\ncharging it Which is very convenient in most situations Unlike OHM's other vape pens, as I mentioned before, this one has the\nvariable wattage and voltage setting. So you can just change them by tapping\nthree times and they'll give you some different\noptions there. Overall it's a great quality vape pen with a lot of different features and functionality Like any vape pen or anything that has settings associated with it you're going to want to play around with it and see what\nworks best for you. The final cool feature that I'm going to go over here\nis: this vape pen has a nifty setting where if you attach it to a new\ncartridge it'll automatically determine the voltage that you want to use for it\nSo we can see what this one is 2.8 volts Back to this original cartridge 3.4\nvolts. So you can do that automatically or manually tapping this\nbutton and changing it around. But it's nice that it won't burn the cartridge\never or overheat it because it automatically detects the settings you\nneed. So there you go! that's the OHM vape pen. I really love mine and I highly\nrecommend you get yours too!", "3Y-JU0l7RiQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand video today yeah again we got actually a brand new brand that I've actually came across on ease before and I've actually you know I've wanted to review it for actually some time now again everybody this is an 18mm educational purpose podcast it's a review I don't condone the usage of these products nor I do not try to boost to sell these products and also we do not sell anything on this channel and again everything here is legal offer 18 and up at cannabis patients you guys are enormous good so today ladies and gentlemen we got a brand new brand to a review it's the old pal brand so I'm not promoting this product or anything like that this is just literally just a review I actually got this full gram $35 crazy huh we got some sativa check this out right here look there's actually some old pal this is actually from 510 which I believe is Oakland I think this is actually a local you know I think this company is actually in the bay keep that out and this is actually the cosmic sativa flavor it's a full sativa you know it has about eighty percent THC which is actually pretty [ __ ] good again everybody this is a $35 gram believe it or not I actually bought this and freaking off off ease and you guys already know man ease sometimes we kind of tax it check the [ __ ] out quick little test want to show you guys that this [ __ ] is look at that stuck for sure no hot water first hit now you lie you guys every time I take the first hit of this cartridge whoa I get laid man I feel this [ __ ] it's a sativa so usually before my morning my morning job you know I wake up take a couple puffs and I go go over to my morning driving [ __ ] you know and 9:00 I'll have one or two puffs literally just leaves me faint like I can already feel it right now I haven't even smoked today today I literally just skipped earlier today I don't really smoke just because I want to make sure I do these reviews with starting with sober but yeah look one thing I really do like about this product again I bought this off ease actually I got to 2 grams for the total price of $70 that includes taxes and delivery so I'm just like dude if this was a $35 full gram imagine if you actually go to like the legit old pal warehouse or whatever they're actually selling these and you buy you buy some stuff so I don't think I've ever seen these you know in the club but sometimes I'm like hmm that's very interesting it's a classic shareable cannabis oil cartridge this is shareable and it definitely is shareable because for the price and again a lot of people are gonna say oh it's fake it's just not no this is not fake this is I legit got this from the east service and they're for sure they're approved they're completely legal and it's not no neighborhood plug this ain't no neighborhood plug [ __ ] so it's crazy if a neighborhood plug [ __ ] is trying to sell you a [ __ ] for gram for like dirty dirty like $30 do that shit's fake as [ __ ] I smoked them before we actually reviewed up a car to do the super Lemon Haze one of my boys got with cool little fake cartridge or whatever and you got it for like pretty expensive but usually if you guys get this from like a a delivery service but it has to be legit though cuz I feel like some there are a couple like delivery services that are just not legit thought a homemade [ __ ] that could might not be healthy for you but please look I don't know if this is true or not I've heard this from a friend that's like a late punch tastes really good too um but I've heard that smoking like I guess fake cartridges or I don't even know if I even talked about but I'm pretty sure it's fake cartridges I guess there was like a youtuber like a weed youtuber some guy that made videos dude I'm pretty sure I don't know where the hell here is this drummer I don't know where it came from or I just don't I don't know but I believe in the obviously you know because it could have been fake cards but I guess like someone passed away from like smoking cartridges and I'm like dude I'm pretty sure it's not gonna be no [ __ ] cannabis you know like legal cartridges had to be some like fake [ __ ] you know I do know someone that bought like four cartridges for like the [ __ ] low and then with fake as [ __ ] dude like there was straight-up hot dog water personally me I know a lot of people that actually do like the old pal they like it because one so I don't think [ __ ] you know proof let's prove it right here look at that that should go it even has a little little sticker we are in California completely illegal dude and this [ __ ] gets you [ __ ] blasted i've only took like what like three four ribs and i'm ready list [ __ ] man but i really do i honestly everybody I appreciate everybody that our clinic everyone that's clicking on these videos man I appreciate you guys so much man because if you guys don't know I do have a main channel and I used to blog and like do pranks and all that [ __ ] back days ago days ago I used to do I gave me videos but that channel is just so mixed up with so much [ __ ] content random content that I got to the point where like I took a break and it just like dinah fell off I'm gonna try to revive it I've been trying for a while now you know but I was like you know what I'm gonna move on to something a little bit more different something a little bit you know like an educational type video if that makes sense so yeah but if you guys want to go check that [ __ ] out go down on my description it's my main channel 120 k subs you know and I actually reached 120 case subs like back like three oh [ __ ] it's gonna be almost four years ago back in like 2016 could've been I got a million right now [ __ ] up but hey [ __ ] have this for a reason right [Music] [Music] like I do appreciate everybody that's clicking on this cuz I know YouTube doesn't like cannabis videos and educational kind of this videos and [ __ ] but I do see that there's a [ __ ] large community there's a lot of people a lot of of age people that want to just watch you know like smoking videos educational cannabis videos type [ __ ] you know and I'm just like doing YouTube should just have its own little like section for that [ __ ] bro you know it's like I don't even wanna tie these videos if you guys see ads okay I'm telling guys this right now if you guys see ads on these videos it's literally [ __ ] YouTube putting videos and [ __ ] cuz first of all I'm not even [ __ ] partnered to me by the time you guys are watching this I don't think I'm ever gonna get this channel partnered honestly I'm definitely gonna be giving away a lot to like I can't really do like [ __ ] weed giveaway since I can't be like pack you know a shitty [ __ ] you know it's a places where like it might not even be like 100 it's legal but it's like you can't like [ __ ] receive it through the mail type [ __ ] you know like on some Canada [ __ ] it's like that legal [ __ ] hear in Caly it's not legal legal like it's get to the point where you just do it you could [ __ ] just smoke a blunt and a smoking area in some places you know people got bitched cuz let me smoke your cigarettes a bunch of tobacco products that [ __ ] [ __ ] kills you dude straight up it literally has a fat ID label that says this shit's gonna give you cancer and it [ __ ] stinks cuz you're [ __ ] smoking like cardboard a [ __ ] you know no offense to everybody that smokes cigarettes if you guys do your thing do what you got to do but I'm telling you right now that is a bad hat bad [ __ ] habit you know and if you guys switch over to vaping and all that vaping [ __ ] quit that [ __ ] brush it's also bad for you too bro and this cartridge probably bad for this too so I do not recommend any type of smoking but again this is for an educational purpose you know my personal review on this [ __ ] but a real [ __ ] though everybody that's watching this man you guys are first James 2nd Janet no matter man everybody like check this out we all got to go to a [ __ ] struggle like it doesn't matter if it's like the struggle is red if the struggle is blue of distress I don't even know I'm saying if the struggle is a triangle a square [ __ ] lid that made no sense that's the path you know that's for your life and [ __ ] but see if you're trying to grind you guys trying to come up be successful in all that [ __ ] I was gonna be a shitload of obstacles so when something's happening in your life that's part of it you know that's an obstacle you gotta face this [ __ ] to get to where you want to be in [ __ ] but damn it have like these crazy eyes like [ __ ] ideas and everything that I want to say on camera every time I say it I'm just look by the way follow me on Instagram I'm crunchy or go down in my description and go I don't check out all my social media I got Twitter snapchat all that stuff I'm gonna try to convince you guys to just chase your [ __ ] dreams take a jade tastes like it takes your passions like it chase your passion you know because in reality if you guys have a talent either if it's [ __ ] drawing you know [ __ ] writing us you're good at writing stories you're gonna like painting you could you're good at something Here I am not knowing how to [ __ ] explain myself but it's like if you guys have a passion or a talent or a hobby you guys are really [ __ ] good I meant pursue that [ __ ] right because I'm telling you guys right now bro you nowadays bro it's the new this is wearing mm about it be 2020 anything is [ __ ] possible that you could monetize absolutely everything bro [ __ ] what's that kid's name [ __ ] Ryan something to bear such the little kid that reviews [ __ ] toys for YouTube dude if he could do that and earn like [ __ ] close to 100 mice where he got like over 50 million dollars a year bro and income or more maybe like 40 to 50 million after taxes because if you got close to a hundred thousand then probably take like half that [ __ ] or even more um holy [ __ ] dude just from revealing choices so if this kid could review toys and become makers it's [ __ ] more more time like millions of dollars then you guys could [ __ ] monetize everything bro it's like you too bro YouTube is like the perfect way to just show off your personality show off you know your talents and [ __ ] there's a lot of people that could take pictures of cars they go they like you know fix cars or all that shade there's car channels shoes - actually I know David got kicks on in person and he has like he's like a sneaker head you know he [ __ ] he reviews sneakers he paints sneakers he customizes sneakers and [ __ ] like that and he's pretty funny he's a funny guy this dude [ __ ] made YouTube videos and then he [ __ ] all of a sudden from just showing off shoes at him making shoes and all this [ __ ] like customizing shoes and [ __ ] painting them all that [ __ ] he got into an eBay commercial true started by the way and I mean that [ __ ] just sounds like what the [ __ ] oven broke YouTube is like a [ __ ] stepping-stone to like this [ __ ] bro crazy like I'm trying to do that bro cuz I know everybody does not want to live that nine-to-five like [ __ ] that [ __ ] you know but if you guys do I'd beid obviously if you guys make like a couple you know small like six figures and [ __ ] and you guys have like a good job with like the benefits and all of the [ __ ] then I

some of the things I have to make them more pleasant make them more aesthetically present Pleasant and make them more powerful first there's gonna be a new battery this is the vessel by vessel and the vessel has performance air intake a smart battery LED indicator three battery settings 2.8 three point two and three point six volts a 240 mAh battery and a magnetic charging port but what it really has I thought and I really am satisfied with was the visual appeal and the handling of a true German writing piece you're gonna be walking around with this now thinking that you've got a pen in your pocket not a vape pen but a pen this is real wall nut on the bottom and the cartridge has real walnut on top it does not come with a cartridge that's filled it comes with a dummy cartridge and I bought this empty cartridge and filled it myself this is tangerine dream THC distill it in here and it's a 5 button system for easy on off so you click one two three four five and now it's going to turn off and I'll click one two three four five again ready one two three four five and it will come on and right now I have it in the middle setting of temperature let's see this is vape pen I'm not usually a cartridge person but when I filled them my selves I've been very satisfied in the past Cheers instant hit not like a prefilled cartridge boy stronger I'm onto something here this is nice I mean this really is a pretty device and it has a very nice magnetic charger so what happens is the charger fits on to the bottom and into a USB so I would say this is the perfect high quality battery pen device for senior citizens this is simple to use this is a button click hold on device just push the button down and it's pre it's refillable which means you can up the ante that's what I mean by that sometimes you can only get 70% 67 percent THC in the prefilled cartridges you know the companies that make them I juice mine with another brand with my syringes I fill it myself of the THC distill it and I get it up to 99% 97 to 99 percent so hopefully you'll take a look at this again I'm very impressed with it now hands on substantial device called the vessel substantial device let's get one more hit and I'm coughing before remember I haven't caught on this yet you can control it yourself that's the really good thing about this it's got the variable control but it feels like you're holding a month long pen hats off the company vessel double thumbs up from seniors donor I like it a lot the vessel is a welcome addition to my vape collection thanks for watching this is the real senior stoner back at you with the vessel", "GEp9jByvV80": "this is a short video showing you how to change the rubbers on a Frankie Eiger tap this one here walking around is linked in between the body and the spell from prolonged use of swivel in the head first thing you need to do is remove the the spell there's a grub screw with tiny grub screw behind the body here at the top Walker theatre of my finger you'll need a u-turn or half milk allen key they get a little bit fiddley does this behind don't need to take it right out another tip when doing this just put a plug in so you don't drop it down the plug on and just pull up on the spout just as I did then to remove the spell all right the reason it's leaking is these rubbers here where you probably see it as a little grease and muck in there but it's these two rubbers here that we want to change as we sew another plastic a plastic one just inside here a little bit tricky together we want to change one of them [Music] she's a little flat bladed screwdriver strike yet I can be a little bit tricky they go and that's that's got a bit of grease on it as well the kit that we sell comes with the right allen key it comes with the three brothers Anna news flurry just in case you do drop that one don't let down the Peugeot alright so we've got the small one at the bottom then they're slightly bigger one and then we know that that plastic one is going back inside there so same again just through the they can be tricky again small flat bladed screwdriver to try and pop that off there's a small one so I'm gonna get them mixed up with the new ones there's the bigger one you can see that that one's starting to parish small one back on the bottom it's not a bad idea to put some some more grease on some silicon grease just on the rubbers just to make them move freely that's that that's the rubbers on that on the step changed and then you want to try get this plastic one back inside here goes in a lot easier than getting it out and then we know it feels stiffer I feel definitely feels better I'm not gonna use the new screw because it's already in there it seems to be tightening up fine if if it's been rounded off or anything you have got that spare there or like I say if you lost it then you've um then you've got that there you want to talk about one other thing I forgot to mention when you're doing this when you're doing it you've got this you got the split of the of the rubber here of the plastic sorry and that gap there is for the screw to go in okay so you want to be lining that plastic half whether roughly where the hole of the screw is just beer see if we've done it now we've got no leaks coming out of there like we did before get grapes on there and I can feel it a lot stiffer new rubbers thanks for watching", "mZYhjVY_v4M": "celina how do W babes cartridges and batteries work well we have two different types of batteries so I'm gonna start with the direct inhale and what you do is you take our cartridge which actually have an indica hybrid or sativa marking on them so IH RS which is great because you don't want to confuse your sativas with your and indica is correct yeah you don't want to grab your sativa when you're trying to go to sleep so you know that was a big request that we got so we just added that and it really helps people be able to differentiate so you want to be sure you know remove this little silicone cap on the end and the direct inhale batteries they come to in a package and they have a handy little USB charger and they are there goes right into your computer correct any USB charger will do or your computer yeah any USB plug so the direct inhale you just take it and it's got a 5-10 universal thread on it so you just screw it right on and then you take a drag so and it just works right from inhaling it just works right from inhaling exactly so you don't have to do anything and so when you're done with it or the battery runs out you go over and since there's two you have this you have your backup charging you just take that one off then you put the other one on the charger and you're ready to go that's great and how long does it take to charge about 30 minutes okay that's not too long yeah and then we have the push button battery which some people tend to prefer because it's a little bit of a bigger stronger battery and you get a little bit of a bigger hit from it okay and so what you do is same thing you just screw it on and you'll want to hit the button five times some people they'll just take it and screw it on and forget to hit the button and they'll think it's not working yeah so you want to make sure you hit the button five times and it'll link three times to let you know it's on and then you take a drag and the other cool thing about our cartridge our cartridges is that we have a central pole that we designed in order to help heat up the oil because the cannabis oil is much thicker than you know regular oils that you know these cartridges were originally designed for so interesting and so it doesn't heat it more thoroughly as you guys eat it more thoroughly and quickly okay so you get a nice big hit you don't have to keep warming it up and so when you're done with the push-button version do you have to turn it off you do you have to push up five times again to turn it off because you don't want it rolling around in your pocket each time you hit the button it'll make the battery you know have a little bit less of a charge yeah and to is the is the charging time exactly the same for push-button model as the direct inhale they're both about thirty minutes yeah it's pretty quick that's great well all good information thanks so much you", "-508Z44D5dk": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another video what's up hope you guys are doing good my day started off so [ __ ] bad um i

"I3C5WsMIXmc": "oh how you doing guys war vision back for another review I'm gonna be talking a little bit louder in this video I noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night whatever it is as always peace out", "Vw8rT3YPzdM": "what up YouTube what up youtube welcome

let's do it so basically what your kid's gonna come with us about 4 pieces aren't real simple you're gonna have the battery you're gonna have the tank and you're gonna have to magnetic pieces and I'm gonna show you what they do and how they work so let's check it out so here you have the battery again very simple to operate one two three four five just turned it off okay as you can see the light

little rubber piece protecting the threads go ahead and take that off and discard it to open it up basically you're just gonna pull the mouthpiece off you can set that to the side and then you got the little blue guy up top here okay it's gonna have a pointy end and a stubby in to fill go ahead and pull the little blue guy off do not lose him all right if you do you're not gonna have a way to plug your tank take some of your CVD alright I having to be using the 120 milligram go ahead and get yourself a little dropper full and as you can see there's a nice little hole up here on top grab your tank and start the dropper in like so squeeze boom done all right this is where you're gonna grab a little blue guy and again you have a stubby end he is a slippery little fellow you're gonna have a stubby end which is that side and I'll pointing it which is this side take the stubby end and insert that in the hole on the top all right don't get super caught up in trying to get this flush all right it does not go in flush it will sit out a little bit all right not a big deal take a cap push everything back good so you hear that little snap now if you drop your tanking now it's not gonna do anything all right see what I'm talking about you have to put one of these little magnets on because that is how it makes connection and actually fires the tank so you can screw on the low profile drop it in boom now you have connection alright and that's the profile you're gonna get where it's basically just the battery and the mouthpiece if you want a little higher profile unscrew of the small magnet and put the high profile or the high-rise on there drop it in and now you have that profile where a little bit of the tank sticks out either way you still have the window here on the side that you can see your level of CBD all right we're gonna leave the high profile on here and we're gonna vape it so again to turn it on even though it is on five clicks you'll know it's on because the little battery indicator light lights up other than that boom here we go guys let's take a vape press the button and puffs it's that simple I can't make it any easier than that so there you go that's it we're done check us out next up button vape code TV cuz it you play big J and we'll see you next time [Music]", "WGYLG9X81pY": "this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 and over I do not user promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws of Prop 64 now sit back and enjoy the video what's good YouTube

into you know we don't like wasting no time out here man so for today's video man I got some of the craziest cartridges I've ever seen bro some of the craziest cartridge like the most eye appealing cartridges that you guys have ever seen I have ever seen anybody has ever seen man these cartridges are honestly like just by the eye appeal like I hope I hope I hope they're freaking good man I hope they're freaking good so for today's video guys we are going to be reviewing the hollow tips cartridges man this company is based out of California you guys can see right there man look look at this what did I tell you guys man this cartridge is crazy just look at the I appeal to it man like you doesn't don't tell me that doesn't make you want to smoke it right away man it looks like a bullet the distillate is super super clear and man look at it alright so right here we got the point 38 special which is a hybrid of full gram and right here we got the ak-47 hybrid all right so aside from the cartridges though I also have the matching batteries if you guys don't remember I did do I do do a review on one of these countries a long time ago so I have this old battery that they used to they used to sell but this is their new and improved battery I'm not sure if it's any different from this but it looks kind of the same but different packaging so let's go ahead and test these two out for you guys and I kind of want to show you guys the batteries just in case you guys do want to go in and cop one of these cartridges and you end up getting the battery so once you open it up you're gonna see open here right here I believe this is going to be the charger and the little magnetic pin connector and then nothing nothing too much in there and then right here itself is the nice-ass battery itself man it's all gold got the holotapes logo right there in the back and it got the hollow tips name right there engraved in the front man I'm telling you bro like if people see you oh and they got their their logo right there on top I don't even see them and I don't think this one has this one yeah you see this one does not have the logo right there on the top so that's that's something new that they added so and but yeah for the most part they do look like they're similar so like I said man these cartridges if someone sees you out in public your men are here with your homie smoking about yo what is that man like this thing is so I appealing man it catches your attention right away man so I'm gonna go ahead and smack both of these cartridges on there and I'll cut you guys in a little second but right here we got the point 38 special men and this right here you guys can see this little cap right here this is a collectible magnet that yes kink like you know I know there's a lot of people out there that buy cartridges of the same company and they're you know it's always cool collecting something it's always cool connecting something so like I said man the little metal connector you are gonna connect it right here at the bottom and show you guys just that twist on and I'll tell you do this thing but I just want to hit it bro I just want to hit it I just want to hit it because this thing is just like catching my eye man I can't stop looking at it so full gram politest point 38 special we're gonna do both of them in one video and then we're probably not to take some [ __ ] double hits for you guys man so Cheers if you guys are over the age of 18 and 21 you are any other deal holy [ __ ] whoa dude yo that was [ __ ] tasty holy dude like you're literally as soon as the first hit man that first hit that first initial hit you get all of the terpenes event all of the terms and then you know that super super leichter penis that you get from plants that are super [ __ ] fire hey guys so after that first hit man this thing had me coughing and honestly like all right initial thoughts initial thoughts I haven't had I didn't really remember what the taste was like but this thing is so flavorful man I'm talking about as soon as you take the first hit that exhale you taste all the Terps all the freakin cannabis like literally everything there's no fruity flavors no artificial [ __ ] this tastes honestly like some pretty freakin clean distally like I'm not even gonna lie that first hit got me already to like you could feel it instantly the head change happen instantly man it might be just cuz I haven't smoked today but honestly you guys know me I'm a heavy hitter so for it to be hitting that hard it has to say something so this is the point 38 special let me go ahead and take another hit of this and tell you guys what the flavor notes are of it on the inhale you get like the really really it's not fruity but it's kind of like on the sweeter side of the terpenes it's not like very very OD ish but on the exhale on this thing has me coughing guys on the exhale it tastes a very very smooth like if you're kind of like if you're hitting um a joint and you guys know when you hit a joint but you can at the at the exhale at the end you can kind of taste like your little small notes of the weed that's kind of what this is providing with you guys so when you and the inhale you get the terpenes and on the exhale you get those those notes of the freaking strain man I've never I'm never myself had the point 38 special and I kind of want to try that in but form because if it tastes it as good as this man we're in for a treat goes so moving on to number two right here we got the ak-47 this one right here is the one that I kind of wanted to try man because like ak-47 like that doesn't that kind of scare you a little bit man like what kind of they they have some pretty unique names man shoutout to hollow tips so like I said man right here we got another magnetic tip just throw that to the side if you want to collect it and then right here same thing you're gonna have to add the adapter luckily for you guys you know hollow tips to make sure it's a pride you guys with too because I know there's a lot of battery companies out there that only ever provide you with one ring so if you ever lose like oh I see you guys these things right here I cannot tell you how many I freaking lost already I've lost literally almost every single one that I've ever had to battery so for them to be able to provide to with you is kind of that a little come up man a little come up so like I said go ahead and screw this sucker on and as you guys know you guys a little design on this man because this is honestly one of the sickest cartridges I've ever seen so as you guys can see right there I this kinda reminds me of like a little Fendi logo I don't know if you guys can see that but inside of the cartridge next to the distillate it looks kind of like a Fanny logo by notes they're hollow tips logo and as you can see right here on the bottom they have hollow tips engrave they got the California weed sticker make sure they're compliant with everything y'all ready though lab clean tested all that good stuff man so let's go ahead and some this on the battery and take some rips man cheers guys oh I didn't even think I was getting ahead I didn't see the light or not fool my gosh one second oh my gosh that was gonna make me cough horrendously if I didn't catch myself well quick written because like literally oh my gosh about oh my gosh that hit that three second hit literally was so much freaking vapor and I it would it just filled up my lie my lungs right away man you felt the lung expansion you felt the turps you felt every single aspect of this penny just filled your freaking lungs up or at least my lungs up you know I'm over here talking for both of us but yeah man I think if I'm not mistaken their cartridges have like a special special element right here in the tip that's supposed to create a larger air flow and create milkier hits pretty much so that could be why we got some pretty good hits me where we've been getting some pretty good hits office all right like I said this is the ak-47 let me see if I can get some more hint to that because our see for me it was just more like kind of like a just straight up OG if Ike if I can tell you guys the truth yes sir damn like literally every single hit that I've taken meant is straight lung expansion guys and I'm not even joking like dramatically like after those four hits that I just took I am blown right now I am pretty freakin faded i feel the major head change already and i'm just chillin at this point i'm just chillin at this point right because these are the craziest card shoes I've ever tried man hold on I'm a hit on both that you guys see if we get some point 3d and ak-47 special man so I don't know what kind of bullets does an ak-47 take just a point thirty there is pazatto point 38 special like a like a bullet or is it a gun I don't know but let's go ahead and hit both of you guys some of the craziest cartridges that I have ever smoked in a while now I can't remember the last time that I've been so attracted to a cartridge like this so right here guys I'm gonna take two different hits man choose guys I apologize for that son and stop I know I'm probably gonna have to cut that out here's me brother what the heck it was so what happened after he caught me cuz I coughed I died literally I it took me literally two or three minutes right now to recuperate myself and get get back into the video I'm not gonna lie I am baked as balls right now these pens those two hits I just took right now to where the icing on top of the cake works this thing tastes so phenomenal like I'm talking about so phenomenal I have not had some cartridges this good in a minute man and it's good to see you know a fellow California company just coming up like this and man like I said man I'm gonna be putting all their information down in the description below if you guys want to check them out man if you're over the age of 18 and 21 you guys have to be legal you already know we don't promote that stuff out here so overall thoughts on me on these pens man I love them I love I'm like I say I love them sorry sorry strong choice of words guys I like them I like them honestly I have no complaint about it I have as of now I have no complaint like the initial thoughts I have no complaints about it I appreciate the aesthetic look that they give you I appreciate like the full grams the really the taste man that taste the taste is phenomenal the taste is phenomenal I'm not even a cat like I haven't tasted something like this I think the last time I tasted something like this was like me the first time I ever tried raw garden maybe the first time I ever tried our garden this [ __ ] blew me away in our sea for someone to be doing this with dissolute it's kind of mind-boggling man it's crazy how good distal is getting I know a lot of people aren't fans of distillate now that's 2020 you know there's so many other sauce and diamonds and blah blah blah but remember distillate it's it has its own purpose it has its own category for a reason man and they lived like hollow tips you guys are dominating the [ __ ] man I appreciate you guys um producing this very very well high quality product man so we're gonna take another hit though want to take another hit for that one time for the one time for you guys I am baked as heck though and I'm gonna end it out here man like I said the flavor for this it's not to overpower with like fake terpenes or it doesn't even taste fake at all it tastes very very artificial very real very tasty man like oh jeez like at least the at least the point 38 special was a very very og and then that a k47 also was a little bit more like it's a weird combination between like an OG like a I don't know what I want to say like an OG and kind of like a just some more earthy flavor you feel me so man I'm big like I said guys overall high quality product 10 out of 10 man let's go ahead and take this rip for you guys the crazies cartridges that I've ever tried Cheers aren't you just get me every single time oh those double hits are finito you take a double hit you're out man so just like I'm gonna be out right now so I'm adding out the video here if you guys enjoyed the damn video go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe it I won't check you guys on the next work", "umY1nkRzRVk": "hello my name

is not uncommon for people to buy these because quite frankly with enough use and honestly lack of maintenance and what happens is that the old soap simply coagulates in here and fouls the valve so with every will oil change with every soap change you should completely flush out everything spending a good handful of several minutes flushing out with warm water all of the old soap but if you do that you'll you will expect several years of maintenance free well of reliable predictable operation based on good maintenance schedule there is an image below this video that shows the other constituent parts that comes out of this bradley unit there is a link below that that will give you the other constituent part numbers for those items so that you can populate that data into the

question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "cGlWaEMgjuQ": "hey guys is the app connection and we're going over bunkie number nine and maybe it's related to that nine pound hammer strain that's the more popular nine that I've heard of but this is a very nice thick got upside down look I think that is not that the thumbs right but look how clear that is this is just a great distill it and kabuki is kind of a perfect example of bud being good or bad doesn't mean a company's cartridge will be good or bad and the exact opposite of that is canta biotics canta biotics the bud is excellent the cartridge is kind of suck kabum key the buds not so hot the cartridges are pretty awesome and particularly I like their I like the quick stick better than their standalone cartridges so they don't use authentic csail they use a clone I'm pretty sure and for some reason the clone hits way better on this the clone versions that they're using whatever the brand of clone is a much better disposable than it is as an actual cartridge the cartridges are still pretty good not as good but the the disposable I would say hits as good as a disposable sea salt does and this thing came in at a little over ninety percent THC and I wouldn't pay that I wouldn't pay full price for their stuff because you can only just go on Thursday and Nevada made of marijuana and get it for cheaper so sometimes it is like 70 or something like that but if you go on Thursdays I think they're 45 attacks for a half gram which isn't bad considering the quality you know it's a really good quality cartridge and you know the oil is just excellent I they also have kind of like the same flavor kind of like select elite kabuki kinda has the same flavor across the brand so there's not a whole lot of like oh this is the best flavor or whatever I mean it tastes decent but let's be honest most of us just go for strength and it's strong and definitely two thumbs up because it's just so strong and taste is not bad at all it's just not like some kind of crazy foodie flavor or you know AeroPro if you're like if if strength is a super important factor if you and you still want super strong I would try AeroPro io pros are great as well and that's something that's also a regular lineup the stuff we're hitting so take a hit of this one you can see how it hits yeah I mean these disposable phones are really they're good so this is a funky and Yakka bunkie I probably would buy their flower again because it just hasn't been that great but their carts are awesome so big - thumbs up thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "G1VQlA7A9R8": "what is up YouTube family boy Vasquez here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys those who are new here I really appreciate you guys for subscribing to the channel and those who've been here you guys are awesome you know I really appreciate you guys taking the time out your day and watching my videos you guys are the MVP for that and if you guys have any questions and think about it you know you guys just want to talk [ __ ] you know I'll reply to you you guys know could probably be friends you know just comment down in the comment section and yeah guys but let me know what you guys been up to it is Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back today you know I'm gonna be chilling at home so yeah guys if you guys have any good shows on Netflix let me know as well but today we have a special cartridge that like I've never thought to be honest when king pen came out they're really really popular but now they have a live resin like they kind of fell off you know cuz there was a lot of fakes and there was just I don't know they were just bad you know a lot of people they really liked kingpin but there are pretty good cartridges but you know I assume that they came out with the life resin line so I definitely had to go down to the shop and pick them up now they're half grams so I don't know if they have full grams yet but the packaging on these are [ __ ] amazing like you know it's like a ten by the tin box you know so it's really cool but yeah it's a half gram I've got it for like 30 bucks so let me give you guys a close-up on the on the packaging on the back the THC level is like sixty it's 61 percent guys so it's not as high so I mean the taste should be spot-on you know life residence should be always be good but you know kingpin a really shocked me when they came out with the light resin you know I was like what the hell because I thought pink paint just you know was regular distillate which it is but I don't know it was kind of weird seeing they came out with some light red and so some people had said you know to go check it out and they're pretty good so we're about to find out right now so the manufacturing date was January so it's a pretty fresh cartridge still I had paid $30 for a half gram so it should be good you know cuz the full grams gonna be like 60 bucks so you have this little sticker on the bottom and I grab the biscotti flavor because that's the one that stood out the most so we're gonna open it so has a little sticker in there where you can fi your product and [ __ ] like that and we're going to spill it damn it's really excited you nod I thought King pin fell off you know a lot of people don't really [ __ ] with king pin because there was a lot of fakes and they were just I don't know some people said they weren't good but to me they're a pretty good cartridges I really liked them a lot so the pill the little stick off I'm just gonna open the little thing [ __ ] here we have this little thing that came out pretty sure it's just like information you know it says the counterfeit the counterfeit prevention program ensures your product is authentic using a kingpin iZON it's the website where you can go check to make sure that you think is authentic your cartridge I should say which is pretty dope you know and yeah you guys can give you guys a little close-up on it it's cuz kingpin there was a lot of fakes and telling you the streets were flooded with kingpin a lot of black market and I'm pretty sure you guys know appreciate guys I've gotten one before so I personally have gotten a fake one before and it wasn't as good so this one has a little digit code on the on the little sticker we just ripped and you just type that up in little computer and you know it shows that you have an authentic pen which is pretty dope you know just to make sure so we're gonna go ahead and open this up and bam that is [ __ ] sick right there tell me now that is not dope right there guys that is like fancy packaging right there I've never seen a cartridge that came pretty sick like that you know it looks like something something that it looks like something expensive you know what I mean so that looks pretty good right there that's the first indicator which this is gonna be good so we're going ahead and take that out and there's nothing else so I'm gonna keep the uh I'm gonna keep this little box you know can probably put some doozies in it I'm in a couple joints you know take this [ __ ] off but this is what you guys came to look for so it's nice to man I'm also keep that it says kingpin on it and and on the back says made with a hundred percent recycled plastic which is pretty cool you know they feel kind of different which is pretty cool so we're gonna take that off I'm really excited about how they're getting the look and how they're gonna taste so I don't really expecting pet to come out with a light resin lines BAM that you have it guys it looks kind of little darker couldn't a live resin so we're gonna take these little rubber caps off and it says royal on it so I think it's like a collab with Roy I think it's like a different company because I seen a had royal on it so I didn't have kingpin so I'm pretty sure it's like a collab which is pretty dope and I was about time kingpin did something you know to come back but and they came back good with some live resin cards which is not bad you know and we're you guys close up and I'm going to flip it over and see if it's some nice thick oil this is a nice little day in there which is the half gram you know I'm pretty sure the coil absorbs some of it and it does not move at all guys and we're going to dry hit this yeah it's pretty weird cuz on the thing it doesn't say kingpin it just says row as you guys can see but I mean I don't care so we're gonna going that dry hit this and I'm going to see there's some flavors if I get some flavors off it this one's a biscotti so a biscotti is like how can I say to me a biscotti is like a cookie a cookie cross with something I'm not sure how it is if you guys are familiar with the biscotti straight let me know in the comment section below would really appreciate that I mean I smoked it before but I'm just like I said I'm not familiar with the cross it so you guys know and I'm not gonna lie to you guys this thing tastes like a cookie you can get you to get that nice clean Wow it's it's amazing guys it tastes like a cookie honestly if you guys ever had the the strain cookies exactly it tastes exactly like it so I'm really excited about that and I think we're gonna go ahead and hit it out of the yo can okay if you guys have if you guys are ever looking for a battery you know I'm not you know then there's sponsor me or nothing but you guys ever looking for a battery get a yo can you know order on their website or just go to the smoke shop any smokes just have it this shit's a [ __ ] [ __ ] beast you know I've dropped it in water it dropped so many times open beers within it still works you know it comes with a little magnet you just screw on bottom of the cartridge so we're going to do that I'm really excited man cuz it was about time [ __ ] kingpin came out with light resin which I've never thought they would you know I thought they would just stick to their normal distillate so here it is we got their magnet on there so make sure the battery's charged guys and let me know what you guys up to on this Sunday afternoon what kind of cartridges you guys smoking on and always don't forget to let me know in the comment section what kind of videos you guys would like to see as well so I know you know what what you bring out for you guys you know because there's times where honestly I go to the dispensary and I don't know what's a good cuz I don't like getting the same cartridges I mean I would but you know I like bringing out a new concept for you guys but if you guys would like to see some new some some of the different I mean some of this same cartridges are over and over just let me know you know I'll do it but yeah guys if you guys are smug along with me go ahead and do so we're about to get high so I'm going to drop this in and I'm gonna drop it in in the battery BAM so cheers guys if you got to smoke along with me go ahead and do so yeah really excited man hopefully hopefully it tastes good right like [ __ ] wow wow wow I'm not lying to you guys this [ __ ] is fired for kingpin a dual life resin honestly I thought it was a joke I thought it was gonna be as good because you know kingpin literally either solis people to come out with live resin and this [ __ ] tastes good it kind of tastes exactly like a raw garden but more of a Terp flavor in there like a strange Pacific flavor like this one's a biscotti and you really really get that cookie flavor him you know that earthy cookie flavor in this fire wow it tastes really good I'm going to hit it longer to see if it like chokes me a little bit so I can get high now I can explain to you guys how the high is it's just making me drool damn yeah this shit's fire guys I'm not you know I smoked a lot of cartridges since ever since I've been smoking I smoked a lot of cartridges before I ran through a lot of them and this this has to be one of the best life raisin cartridges I've tried i'ma have to compare it with the raw garden one day man this shit's fire it tastes exactly like would it like the strain if you guys had a biscotti it tastes exactly like cookie it's like fresh earthy clean taste - it's so good now the high you get a nice good of buzz you know I'm feeling good already I've smoked it in the morning I smoked a blunt but I kind of sobered up so that's why you know I decided to do the review so I can explain the high man but I feel good you know afraid for being 61 percent THC it's not a lot but it it also depends on the strain you know you also get different effects the THC level doesn't always got to be high to get a good feeling you know what I mean that's what a lot of people don't know cuz just cuz you hear it 90 or 80 percent doesn't mean all I'm gonna get high as [ __ ] it's not like that you know well some people it kind of is but to me like some strict like the strains you know they all got their own high so whether it's 60 80 per se you know just gonna is gonna get any hot so I'm feeling good right now you know I'm getting a nice little buzz so I'm going to hit it again just to you know the cartridge tastes good it tastes so good I can probably smoke it in one sitting but I'm gonna try and save it a little bit for the weekend so I'm going to hit it again before I take off gotta go to the store man I'm we're stuck I already booked and these things are so big if you guys ever see the kingpin man you guys you guys got to give him another try if you guys said [ __ ] kingpin before this is the time to give him another try man this [ __ ] tastes so good I'm not lying to you guys they had like four different kinds of flavors but like I said the biscotti ones the one that standard out the most so it is really good you know you get that nice cookie taste to it so do you guys ever see these you guys got a copper you know they're $30.00 1/2 gram right here in California in Modesto California that's where I'm from so I don't know they're probably gonna be twice as much over there from where you guys are from but over here at medical and recreational prices are the same so so yeah guys I really appreciate guys appreciate you guys watching my video and you guys stay tuned for more guys and uh hope you guys stay safe don't do no dumb [ __ ] and yeah just like and comment on the videos and don't forget to let me know what kind of videos you guys would like to see and you guys have a good day guys", "C1ocH2KMqfY": "hey everyone this is concen and today we're going to talk about a question that we get quite a bit here at vaporizer review and that is how do I clean my pen vape and there's quite a few pen vaporizers out there but we're going to stick with the three general styles we have a dry herb we have a waxy concentrate and then we have an e juice style pen vaporizer here so we're going to go over how to best clean and maintain these vaporizers we're going to start off with the dry herb style I happen to have an at most Rx here I personally not a huge fan of drier pen style vaporizers they generally don't work too great often burn a lot so what we have here is a nameless rx with a glass screen down in there covering the herbs so we're gonna take a cleaning brush I find works best for the dry herb units and just kind of go down into the chamber and do the best that you can just simply take and clean the herb right back I they're just tapping it out onto a table into an ashtray whatever you have to just kind of get the herb out of the unit and with these pen units because they have the screep of the spring that pushes down on there it can be packed a little tight in there and when it all falls out if your pen unit happens to have one of the little glass screens in it I just take that and I put it into a little bit of isopropyl alcohol just a little bit of rubbing alcohol that I have here it's glass you can drop it in there and let it soak for a little while and while that's going on I like to just continue brushing any of the loose herb out of the drier chamber what you want to be weary of with these is there's a little coil right down inside if you accidentally snag and pull on that coil becomes loose in any way you're going to end up damaging the chamber and then this thing just ain't going to work right so you want to avoid pulling on the coil down in there just gently brush mostly aim for cleaning out the sides of the sir chamber there and when that's cleaned out some people like to take just a little bit of isopropyl and q-tip very small amount because you don't want to damage it holding it upside down take it and run it along the inside around the threading area this will keep it clean and maintain it without damaging the coil in any way and that's how we suggest cleaning up the dryer type of a pen style vaporizer very simple easy to maintain you know not the best it might end up burning but that's how we would handle the dryer now we're going to take a look at the wack style vaporizer and right here I have a micro vape nano unit very discreet very portable designed for use with waxy concentrates to go ahead and clean this one basically what we're aiming to clean here is the threading on it I like the pen style vaporizers for wax that are like a threaded connection and screw on as opposed to the ellipse style that pop off I think those atomizers they come free in your pocket easily I like when it's threaded on you know you have a secure connection to both the chamber and the battery will stay together well but one of the things you face when using that is you get some pretty gunked-up threading and when it comes to cleaning a wack style vaporizer you're not really looking to clean the coil you don't want to damage that because it's no longer going to heat up the whole idea what this really is to take in a q-tip with a little bit of the isopropyl alcohol and this is more about cleaning the threading on the wax tile vaporizer cleaning the threading is going to help keep it operating smoothly because you're going to be able to easily disconnect and then reconnect the top of the chamber to where the wax goes and with these style of cartridges where they thread off right where the wax goes it can be kind of a hassle if it's stuck together you're trying to open it so frequent cleaning of the threading on the wax tile vaporizers is really all you need that's kind of the whole goal you don't want to damage the coil in any way shape or form if you damage the coil it's just not going to heat up any more so when using your tool to load the wax onto there it's my suggest and all of our suggestions here at vaporizer review that you don't scrape it across there if you end up scraping it there's a very good chance you're going to damage it so that's something you're looking to avoid when it comes to loading just try and gently get it onto there do not be scraping across the coil and when it comes to cleaning all you're aiming for is the threading just want to get all the wax off the threading so you can unthread it and rethread it very easily we're going to take a look at now would be the less the pen style units we have here and this is the one mostly for like a juice I personally don't vape a lot of ejuice myself but I like a buck-naked style when it comes to these more often than not you're just going to change out the heating cartridge here the oil tank after a few uses if you're using different flavors it's not going to be that great but if you only have one tank handy and you do want to clean it out what I suggest doing is getting another one of the oil loaders and just fill it with some warm water the style I hear has a little bit of a wick so it's going to possibly retain some of the flavor but if you take a little bit of warm water and just kind of flush it through out there that's going to help clean it up a little bit and remove some of the flavor from it without having to buy a new tank every time you want to change the flavors that you're using in there a little warm water is all it takes you don't need to really soak it too much you want to avoid getting it down the hole in the middle as well as otherwise it might leak through there so avoid getting it down the hole in the middle otherwise there's might leak through on you and that's really all you need when it comes to the pen style close it up with that on there like this with a little bit of warm water in there keep it read and just give it a little bit of a shake this will help loosen up any of the e-juice that's in there and remove some of the flavor from it and that's all you really need to do when it comes to the EG style so that's our suggestions when it comes to cleaning pen style vaporizers if you have any further questions or just want to leave any comments go ahead and leave them down at the bottom of the video and we're here to assist you alright guys Cheers", "21X3JqB2EBM": "welcome to the basement [Music] yes what's up new to guess what man we back today and today we're gonna do a review on something a little different got this little package today of course I got the little sticker and everything like that that always comes with to the phone's product but today we're gonna do the Twitter phone's be calm and not only we're going to do the favicon but it came in this nice case so then if you're gonna go and it says it's a travel case so I don't know if you could take you on the plane I'm not going trying to do that so this is the travel case this is the car this is the gelato number 33 to see what this bottle looks like is it thick okay thanks see my house is kind of cool right now got my a/c on it's 90 degrees outside and gorge yourself when I got this out the mailbox the box was actually hot so maybe I'll all use a little thicker but it still looks pretty good so I'm gonna start here of course we got the tweeter phone's battery that comes with it charge it that has the little tweeter phones logo on it which is cool this really looks cool it's rad so let's put this together and see we working here I know this thing should have some charge on it we're gonna test it out so it does have charge it has three voltage settings and the way you change the voltage you press the button here three times now let's see with a song okay that's green I think Green is the medium that's blue that's a lower setting and that's red so actually it's the other way around I think but whatever it is and you press it two times to preheat so now is preheating we're gonna stop that way I wanted to get to and not a bad taste not a bad taste tastes almost like it has mint in it and let's look at the it also comes with the letter to law enforcement of course I love having that this is how to here tells you how to operate that animals and this product has 65 point 93% cannaboids and the total CBD percentage is 65 point 87 percent Wow that's a lot okay so this is not the full special product or a broad spectrum so right now we're dealing with discipline so that's what this is all about right here so this product here is good to calm you down you know if you have anxiety or if you just want to relax this is what this is good for it doesn't taste bad I also want to try a few different flavors so I kind of like it me as far as the effects I'm really not getting too much of an effect in it that was my second time pulling on it so give me a minute I'll let you guys know how I felt but it doesn't taste bad that's the most important part I know I heard a lot of people complaining about I hate the way it paints and this one doesn't taste bad the Delano 33 pretty good good job three two forms I'm just waiting to see how that this affects me right now I've had anything today I didn't smoke any flower no CBD babe juice because I do they I'm starting to feel a little calm now all that CBB inside here it's not a work already yeah absolutely so it was definitely doing what it's supposed to do I'm feeling a little calm or a little better than what I did when I first started shooting this video so you know I got a weap calling this over meanness all we really do with this thing here man I like it so I'm definitely gonna be ordering some more cards from Twitter forms few other companies I'm gonna try them all out you know I'll let you guys know exactly how this thing goes be back with you in a few feet", "z8Ga2A0sTwQ": "[ __ ] Boise man and today I got a wee review I was gonna post this up yesterday but I enjoyed it too much and huh I liked it anyway so today's strain is a Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies and the cartridge is a distiller 1/2 gram and it's made by Burano I believe that's a Maryland company that's one from and it's a hybrid so THC percentage is 80% and I don't know how I think CBDs got 3.11 and yeah so it's got a good taste yeah unbelievable I mean I after like through two seconds I'm coughing my ass off like this is for all the people that said that my cookies cart was fake right but i'ma show y'all this one right and y'all gonna see oh hold on hold on why I said look the same okay so this is the box right y'all and that's right yeah Girl Scout cookies yeah 60 bucks four or five or you know for a half a gram and here we go right here so look at that beautiful oh yeah I'm beautiful too so beautiful man so perfect so I'll just drive it right I'm a little pen so we're gonna do a pre I think this is dead it would die on our view huh so", "nkLla_V-vmA": "[Music] what's up I simplistic here back with another video if you can tell from the title already we got that buddies let's just do a quick little thumbnail hopefully it's good I know you guys have been requesting for me to try the buddies cartridge for a while now and I finally located one in my local dispensary I actually picked this up at a dispensary that I've never been to before well that's a lie because it's a franchise there's actually another one that I've been to with the same name but I haven't been to the newer store which is located on McHenry and yeah I mean it's called people's remedy as you can see right here you see the little QR code all that stuff and I bought this for 43 bucks originally priced at 37 but you know tax and all that stuff so $43 for our gram cartridge not too bad but yeah I'm excited the image up here it kind of looks like the Select cartridge the same cartridge so yeah should be pretty interesting it says seventy-three point zero six percent THC and as you know buddies they like to show their terpene profile as well which is so dope I feel like a lot more companies should do this because terpenes have individual effects and it's good to know what's in what you're smoking like there's probably other stuff that they can mention on the label that's in there that that companies don't even so or maybe they don't even have terpenes in them you know so as you can see it says a pioneer four point six one beam murder scene four point four eight and then beep I mean one point something and this is the string and lucid blue guys buddies and it is a sativa so it should get me getting me to wake up you know I'm saying so we're gonna open this is I'm gonna take good care of the box so never [ __ ] it ripped off the stick little lever to pull out okay Wow okay even has the buddies logo in there noise yep same type as select [Music] very very thick this is liquid diamond sauce liquid diamonds live resin boys so not the best smell like this citrus we're gonna be using my chill battery for this one very very good battery it's a good truck alright buddy Cheers it's a it's dark it's what what ten what you tend to see when you get a live resin in your cartridges other than raw garden I don't know how they get there so light but you know if it's their secret they're gonna keep it to the grave with them but as you notice just like the Ursa this one's very very dark just like that not as dark as the Ursa so I'm interested to see how this is gonna taste so Cheers [Music] Wow not gonna lie that did taste pretty [ __ ] amazing things I've noticed not as Turkey it could be the strain it's not as chirpy as the strain that or is it used but it's not as chirpy but still really really good and for $10 cheaper you really can't complain about that it's just minuscule you know it's still um when I'm saying it's Lester P that means like just a little bit you know I'm saying I'm not saying that it's like one level down or anything but this is pretty [ __ ] good I'm not gonna lie you know I bought this myself so this is not in a way like a paid review or anything I bought the Ursa one as well and Wow if I had to choose which one to get no I can't take another hit oh the cloud production is there ooh the taste is there ooh the potency is there holy [ __ ] that [ __ ] really hits so just like the Select cartridges it just hits just like that it hits just as hard as the select cartridges I would say it's a lot better in taste than the Select cartridges because the select cartridges all taste the same to me this one although I haven't tried other strains I'm sure they taste according to string and not just some generic co2 distillate tasting oil but and I'm liking it I'm gonna take one more hit for you guys and yeah this I'm probably gonna enjoy this behind-the-scenes you know I am Cheers maybe I'll do a blinker for you [ __ ] it I don't know how with this shirt off time for this is but [ __ ] it I feel like this buddy's cartridge hits harder than the earth cartridge but the Ursa one tastes a lot better and I feel like they just switch those two around it's like vice versa you know this one the taste is a little bit less but the clouds are a little bit more what the Ursa it's the clouds are a little bit less but the taste is a lot more there but overall pretty good you know this is only ten dollars cheaper than the Ursa cartridge which is pretty [ __ ] good in my opinion yeah I don't know I think I got to do like another top five cartridges of two or just top a top five cartridge list you know I really like I'm sorry like I haven't been getting too much cartridges lately it's just that most of them are a pretty pricey and I have a wax pen and usually just a grandma wax just will last longer to me than me having this at my disposal cuz I'm gonna just be [ __ ] hitting the [ __ ] out of it you know like if it's there it's there you know it just makes me want to hit it hopefully you guys enjoyed this video would I get another buddy's cartridge yeah definitely like I have nothing but good things to say about this other than maybe like the Select cartridge being like a plastic mouthpiece you know maybe a ceramic one would be better maybe I'm just spoiled from the earth one who knows you know but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video peace out [Music]", "q8ArK3-zwlk": "what is over severe viral got my hums like literally taking your smashes everything chairs I've seen that mud we have this alaric cart I found that I didn't really see before there's holes in the bottom of the cartridge here so literally you get all out you don't lose nothing which is pretty cool so we're gonna give us a whack old iron along he'll break kilobytes my anything sodaw what up has it has a different taste of their flower they definitely stepped up their game huge on the flower we have a little bit of lemon [Music] [Music] yeah check out I love the cartridge I don't like is the air holes up here oh it just seems like you're sucking way too much area in with these air breakdown Keystone ha ha but anyways with all the cartridges I had I had the Cresco gone field I had the prime Afghan chunk or some prime Afghan chunk the Alera ecto cooler and the Calypso chem dog I brought all them down there with me all brand new reviewed them all literally had a whole day with each of them that prime cartridge will start there the prawn carton and the Calypso I started out with the rocket fuel cousin boat like the rocket fuel I didn't like it wasn't as full as I wanted it to be tour seemed like there was a lot of head space on the Cresco cartridge but I liked it the Cresco cart they always taste good to me Cresco cartridges they just have a good flavorful taste but back to the prime that prime cartridge was one of my favorites it tasted amazing tasted like you just did a DAB this'll erawan I mean pretty much what do you think it tastes like we've done yeah how's it don't really have a taste yeah it's just like it's like I can't force the off with different ones yeah this one here I do but I just I don't know I like people like P I like making the videos more than using them like I'll give whoever is with me or whatever whatever I got a med card you know I'll give them I'll give them a try the shot let me know if it turns black but I usually just smoke the cartridges from the dispenser Aries no yeah I mean it's just with all the craziness that's going on all the cartridge [ __ ] it's like it's hard to trust anybody I mean if I do make a cartridge I get all the paperwork from the company to me hey they show me the you know what's what's actually in the mixture you know main pg/vg coke or not MCO oil or MTO oil whatever whatever whatever but back so I'd rather yes I'm way around our smoke dispensary cartridges but if you can save big money smoking making your own cartridges and smoking on me I want to put some of that cigarettes so I bought a jewel down it in Florida because everything's they're cheap down there got of jewel from down Florida and as soon as it runs out I like the hash Hayes I like hash Hayes and in the gun we only really have grams I mean no we they really only sell half-grams our dispenser arey they go from anywhere from 40 is the lowest I've seen them that was from Terrapin good cartridges but I swear they go really fast like the liquid in them it's like seems like it goes really quick and that's again with the prime the prime like I said I loved it very Medicaid and heavy in the cup it got me through a couple good days but I say it seemed like it went the fastest out of all the cartridges was that Prime one but the crest no like I said it it's a crush no cartridge they're all the same they all got a little head space I like that they all taste good to me some you know are way better than others but the crest goes good they're all good they're all good cartridges but that calypso on that one there it tastes amazing and it [ __ ] lights you up lights you up it's so thick like the UH it's the oil and it's so thick that like it leaves a film inside the whole cartridge I left the Donner was burning up you know you start getting there I so I hate that's not like about this cartridge it has some air holes at the bottom so you get all we're gonna find out but you should get all of your you know stuff out of them [Music] oh oh anyways we are doing something crazy we have found a weight of it takes you ever see the guy that holds the vacuum blower thing and puts the big drum wheel up there it's like the things that blow up the car lock inflatable he died he died yes see that's that's so nice how that stays right down in there your holes are right at the bottom so you're probably gonna get every drop that Calypso cartridge it was all I mean I loved that cartridge that cartridge is my favorite powerful taste the taste of that clip suppose it was Kevin dog even their wax and waxes booze totally amazing not worry from Wow gives you the sweats face Illinois's alright if you house the Cresco cartridge is out there in Illinois because I'm getting a lot of different mixed up stories about the cartridges out there but yes we are gonna do I'd like to do it as soon as we get a thousand or two thousand on here or thousands so there 80 to $90 for a crusty old cartridge see we don't have edibles on here that's what's due fees our cartridges like I said the cheapest forty dollars Cresco cartridges are $50 to I think they have the reserve line they're $75 I think want to say that's the highest price on a cartridge but that's only a half a gram and if they do have a gram which I've seen them I think once or twice I don't know if I I don't know if I had one I don't know if I had a gram I had the new stones I don't know where I'm going with this but you know no I doubt Oh bro hell yeah I'm not watch something I was like swear I was the first one to get a sticky stick in Michigan I went to the reef dispenser Airy the owners dizzy was just there I got ready I'm at like the donors dizzy I got a ton of these bags I got this dizzy hats they blessed me so well I did probably 15 different reviews on it but yeah them sticky stix um cause I'm still he sticks there ain't nothing I love them I like them better than the cookies cartridge like the real half gram cookie cartridges I love the sticky stix way better like I'm jonesing for one it's seriously I have my battery and a little crumb left in the cart sitting in my house like with my on my shelf and all my good [ __ ] I'm just like man what is that thing we'll just fill up one day like them cartridges the ones I had

bad he smokes and we'll see you guys on the next video peace", "JFpLUTbWBw8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who saw my um ounce hot box in the bathroom man that [ __ ] was [ __ ] had me loading man thank you guys for um being in my premiere because i premiered and i was in the chat talking to a bunch of people that were watching my video so shout out to all you guys that were in there one more last rip and i'm out peace [Music] you", "UjtL08fDR0c": "hey guys it's Dave connection doing a review of the apex cartridge this is a pics repin on it so it came inside this thing a little confused by this too the TC is 83% but then there's 497 so I'm not that tired but I don't know anyway so it's about in 80s and we got this packaging came as we came this inside this and this was an indica and the strain is Sunday Drive and overall I gotta say I like this thing the intake hole seems small it's a little bit smaller but it still hits really good it hits good and has good effects so overall this apex cartridge I mean the taste is kind of a little bit let's say a little bit of a sweet taste maybe a little bit sweeter than some of the other distillates but it does taste good and this is one of the better like kind of off hardware that i've seen you know usually gets e-cell or something cecil is awesome but a lot of clones aren't that good this just seems kind of like its own thing and it it really performs well it hits good and also have a magnetic adapter on the bottom but this is a good performing piece of hardware and the airflow is really good you know the packaging is fine I don't know if the repent is supposed to mean but I'm a bigger hit looks like not that so yeah I really like this cartridge I think it's good and definitely something I'll try again I got it in two cousins time next time I'll try sativa and yeah it seems pretty good good oil good taste effects seem good so apex from Colorado two thumbs up thanks for watching guys this is a review of a apex Sunday Drive and have a great week", "FBru-i5Xf5g": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people

smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the

everybody unhealthy and I'm the director of operations at one release today I'm going to talk to you a bit about our baked article to have oil of course so our big cartridges are all glass and stainless steel they are 510 threads so they should connect to any 510 thread push-button battery now the push button is important because the way that our cartridge is designed they will not work on a pull-through battery so all of our cards come with a silicon cap here on the top I recommend twisting clockwise to remove this Jack now that is 2 times if you twist counterclockwise you can potentially loosen your mouthpiece if you do that you run the risk of leaking some of the oil out on the side if it gets warm and run to the top so just twist make sure these guys are clamped on nice and tight we connect these guys to any push-button battery again ah I just screwing them into the top here on the base plate now Arbus push button batteries take 5 click to turn off and 5 flicks to turn on then you know that the battery has a good connection with the cartridge if when you push the button you get a solid steady life on these batteries we change the voltage by clicking three times and for each different voltage you'll get a different light to indicate where you're at for our batteries we right usually recommend vaporizing around 3.3 volts to 4.0 volts depending on which matter you have and what all you have I personally prefer to vaporize about 3.3 volts no higher than 3.6 now our cartridges we do not usually recommend for refills however if you are going to refill our cartridge you unscrew the mouthpiece let that guys side and with your syringe you're going to want to fill around suppose into the area that you see between the the metal post and the glass tank do not fill directly into that post and it's because if you do you'll actually clog your mouthpiece and will be able to draw if your cartridge is leaking chances are that it's leaking from either the bottom gasket or the top gasket we've actually replicated 14,000 feet at 100 reads Fahrenheit without any leakage out of the bottom so we're pretty confident that one and if that is happening then chances are you've accidentally unscrewed your mouthpiece a little bit so all that you do screw that back down nice and snug and make sure that your cartridge remains upright as opposed to buying it on slide or upside down if the oil flows into the post and it plugs your mouthpiece all you need to do your unscrew your mouthpiece okay take something long and in like a paper clip and just run it down through the mouthpiece now you should be able to clear this guy right up if the oil is a little too thin you can actually refrigerate your mouthpiece for a few minutes taking that all up and it should push out nice and smooth but you can see now you're getting a lot of that oil out you're just going to drop that back down into your change if there is an air bubble that builds up around the hole all you need to do is you need to keep the oil in order to get it to settle again you can use your body heat just hold it in your hand for a while put it in a pocket that's close to your body or run it under warm water either I personally for your life all you do one the lighter over the black part of the tank and then hold it upright to allow the oil to settle again now this is perfectly safe because our cartridges again are made of glass and stainless steel and the gaskets inside our high temp resistant silicone so you're not going to be putting any bad chemicals into your oil", "ZIPLMpaH-JI": "want to do like some I've not just I don't know if you guys I'm pretty sure you guys have had select cartridges before I've no they were just me if I'm just tripping but honestly like to meet all of these cartridges they kind of taste us safe so yeah they kind of have like a strong hashey taste to it some of them's up so I have I got this one for like around $35 here to attack so it's a citrus SAP you know I grabbed the citrus top because it sound like I had it you know it was like fruity so we're gonna see we're gonna see how what it tastes like you know if it's like really fruity or is it just hashey you know like the rest of them so let me know if you guys know too you know like I'm talking about if you guys have select cartridges before if they have that strong agitation or let me know so the total carnival noises 87% you know it's been a while since I don't select you know these I used to [ __ ] with select heavy I used to get one of these a lot no every week Gracie [ __ ] would select so and I don't know where I just you know like I expanded I started trying new things you don't [ __ ] it when your cartridges so I mean don't get me wrong these are

open you're gonna get a nice little seesaw cartridge I like these right here these [ __ ] rip you know out of all the cartridges they have you know there's some different kinds and [ __ ] these are one of the ones that hit the most you know you get big clouds so you go ahead and take it out so we're gonna go try hit it I'm gonna let you guys know if it's like if it's like really fruity so this is a citrus up you know I'm gonna be doing a dad in video if you guys you guys stay tuned for that you know I already done I still need an editor and [ __ ] so I probably have like two videos uploaded at once so yes stay tuned for that so here we have the whole ever know and flip it over it's pretty nice to go you know garance looks pretty good but they could do better like in the flavor why isn't she I don't know if they Todd what's the process they do it but most of these cartridges they kind of taste the same to me so yeah guys pack on this flight 35 attacks she's not bad you know so not here in Cali do the bubble test I really appreciate my new subscribers if it wasn't for you guys you guys I wouldn't be where I'm at right now you know you guys are [ __ ] awesome I'm just trying my

we're gonna enjoy hit this and we're gonna see if there's some flavors of it yeah I'm not lying to you I can't read it tastes like that strong catchy tasting this one and that's why I kind of like stop [ __ ] with select because they just have that strong hash taste to I mean it's not bad like I said but it's like I want to taste some mouths besides I want to try some fruity that's what I grabbed the citrus tabs or they don't taste like citrusy I probably I don't know probably want to stop I'll stop buying select so we're gonna hit this cheese if you got a smoke along with me go ahead and do so bring out your bongs pies whatever the [ __ ] you guys got to KI this one along with me cheers guys yeah guys it tastes it tastes clean it tastes good but it tastes like exactly like the other cartridge I had a gun like two weeks ago exactly like yeah I hope you guys got to fill me on this one I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about if you guys [ __ ] with select most of them they just taste the same like this one it tastes good I'll get it wrong you got some nice clean taste to it can't want to describe it but it's just like the profile that the terpene profile is not there I don't know man but don't get me wrong these are pretty good I really like them a lot so but I probably will not be getting so many more this probably gonna be the last gram I get in a while so so yeah I probably just stick to like rock gardens and I'm know if you guys heard of bear labs I probably get like a half gram with some bear labs or I don't know this just I'm not grabbing the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things but sometimes it's just I run out of options you know but that likes Dizzy's they have plug plays I have a whole bunch of [ __ ] you know so you guys just let me know like on the comment section what kind of cartridges you guys would like to see in the future and yeah if you guys like hot box of videos you know I haven't done one yet but I will soon I'm I just haven't got the time yet so I'll probably do that tomorrow you know get out of work something and yeah guys I'm going to hit this again for you guys well yeah these cartridges right here they [ __ ] rip these see Stiles right here with the c-23 these are like one of the best cartoons you guys can have oil in because they [ __ ] [ __ ] but oil goes too quick so the high on these cartridges they're pretty good don't get me wrong you get I'm like you know you feel like the quick buzz like after like two big hits you feel like a good buzz off him this was a hybrid this one's a hybrid so you know you get the boat effects you get the indica sativa so it's a pretty good it's a pretty good cartridge guys and I'm gonna have to shut again one more time before I cut the video short oh my god flip it over after ripping the [ __ ] out of it it's to hold its thickness there so it's pretty good quality but just the taste it has that strong hash to taste to it it tastes like some of the cartridges that were made when the cartridges were first [ __ ] you know came out like the oil like just straight hash you know with no [ __ ] terpenes in there but it's still clean and still good and I really like to select so I don't know guys it's probably like the last car I don't know yet let me know what you guys think in the comments section if you guys [ __ ] with select I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you guys know what I'm talking about so you guys let me know in a comment section if you guys like these or not so or which or which ones you guys have favorite flavor and let me know in the comments section I would I'm just curious mind guys hope you guys having a really good day and stay blessed cheers guys peace", "CjDlOoHg3eo": "[Music] yo what is going on everybody it's your boy joseph to realist and today sorry about my buzzing on my ac it does that every time it gets really cold and empties out the water anyways dude let's get into the what i want to do today about the review for playing jane i definitely have some fire right here in the car i kind of tried it already but i'm gonna try it again but i definitely love let me see if i give you a closer look at it no nothing okay there it goes so sorry about the glare let me see i could just okay so this is the plain jane girl scout cookies 750 milligram uh cbd so this i believe is one gram oh it's okay i don't know this it looks like a one gram cart whatever um but anyways i'm gonna open this up guys because i'm like definitely gonna be smoking this or vaping it i should say um let's see if it has a smell to it like it almost it almost like to be honest whatever like this is one of the cbd carbs oh sorry i'm not zoomed in on myself okay let me see if i could show you all closer look at it no nope [Music] okay there it goes so it looks like a record like a regular you know one of the descartes but what's cool about this is that look at it see that bubble right there most cbd carts are going to like flow to the top with you know in like half a second but this one is very very thick um it's very um yeah look at that [ __ ] dude like it looks like a thc card to be honest like it's crazy it's only 30 dollars like most people that sell cbd carts and want to charge between like 40 to 50 dollars whatever um some people want to charge 25 for like a half a gram like um honestly whatever like this is definitely some like okay i'm gonna try my i'm gonna try it on my relaxo it's a m9 from relaxotec um it's cool because it has like the the pod system cart which you can fit pod systems and then you can put uh the t 510 thread whatever so anyways guys yeah this is the review on uh plain jane girl scout cookie and um definitely i tried it out already whatever i'm glad i could take it out it looks like it's using um a ceramic coil i mean a ceramic um tip or whatever i think might be ceramic coil inside too but all right guys let me get into it i've been talking to that much but it definitely it smells really good and like it just has a feel of a tac card like it's ridiculous okay anyways oh [ __ ] it wasn't on whoops sorry about that guys okay okay sorry i have to change the settings real quick you know green blue red all that [ __ ] wow wow okay so definitely get some very good vape amount of like cloud smoke whatever a cloud bait that you get is definitely very nice um the taste of it's very very uh very s subtle but it's there and it's very sweet um it it tastes like it's like concentrated cbd and terps honestly whatever like that's you definitely get the terps and uh that's the cbd whatever um like it is not harsh in the throat at all whatever is very very smooth um very it tastes very pure like it's just the two ingredients whatever that's supposed to be there yeah you definitely you get that girl scout cookie taste like you definitely get that like like a sweet like it's kind of hard to describe whatever it just tastes really good like honestly that's pretty cool that they [ __ ] like they got i believe this is how cbd cards should be and like so far whatever my favorite was a farm life and um black water had a good like thc eight um but it was half a gram and no terps they just added terps to their stuff so i haven't tried that yet but at the moment i believe this plain jam was gonna be my top choice um the farm life had some good flavor and stuff and but the crystals um felt like it took up a lot of space whatever so i believe there's not enough like juicing that's supposed to be in there um but um this one is definitely it just feels like a thc car which i really like whatever it's very thick but it this is definitely cbd it's definitely 100 legal and um but it just it just to me it has like a feel like how thick it is and the way the color uh the taste and everything it just [ __ ] it's the closest you're gonna get from a t if you're gonna switch from a thc card to cbd whatever and like not have a big difference it's definitely i would i would definitely recommend this guys um [ __ ] 9.5 out of 10 like honestly like this fire um i like the fact that they use the ceramic white coil whatever like uh the metal one's pretty good but i i prefer the ceramic because um excuse me we're burping up tea um i feel that like these type of ceramic ones whatever if they do have a ceramic coil then like it doesn't um like the metal ones or something that the oil will get real like thick and like like dark colored and i feel like it has a higher chance of it burning the coil and then from there it's you know whatever your vape is going to taste like [ __ ] but the ceramico i never had any issues with it i always got to the end no discolorations and definitely the smell taste the smell and the the taste of it didn't change so um yeah guys anyways that like i said i recommend this i'll leave the links down below for instagram and their website they're definitely a fire ass company um some you know like they have some very good products on cbd whatever when it comes to flower they just i think they just added lotions and solvents i don't know what to call them um i forgot what the name of it is but i think it's some kind of like i don't know it's something to be honest whatever i don't really use it whatever so i don't know too much about that thing might be like for like chapstick or your skin or something but anyways um yeah they're definitely always adding new products they're always like you know changing up stuff whatever adding new strains every [ __ ] couple weeks i see a new strain on their on their website so that's why i saw the cat's meow make sure to go check out that with that video whatever it's on fire i'll just like give you a quick look at it but it's some fire uh cbd let's see if i can maybe i'll zoom and look at this there it is right there kinda there it is there's some fire guys that's some indoor from [ __ ] hawaii bro so i got some [ __ ] indoor from hawaii i got a car with girl scout cookie whatever and i only spent like what since 20 30 how much i spent i'm confused now so 30 30. i spent about 60 something books on it like um i was always free shipping

Eureka vape cart this train is London poundcake it's coming out of Los Angeles and it's testing at 87 point 16 percent THC I'm gonna open this up for you guys all right so I'm gonna slide this piece off and then I say cognate that keeps it closed alright so when you open up the box the cartridge is gonna be in a sealed pouch like this it says it says high potency oil so we'll find out alright today I got the Moxie battery in the raw garden battery I know my last fall garden video I forgot to use the Moxie battery so I'm gonna make sure to use them both you know what I'm gonna train you to blink around both you guys I was trying to hit that blinker on my raw garden battery the other day and they wouldn't believe and I was confused cuz I didn't know if something was wrong with the battery or if it was just the way I was hit but at the rock garden battery - because it is not-it's buttonless it's just they draw two hits oh here we go it's my first time trying London pound key but it does have kind of like a sweet taste to it I made it one more time for you guys before I jump - blinker it has a good flavor it's hitting nice and smooth enough this cartridge was gonna next match or not so I filled up a fat dive of Girl Scout cookies into puffs kheh hopefully you're smoking along let me know down in the comments below what you're smoking on and Cheers [Music] [Music] i'ma switch over to the Moxie cart now I like this Moxie cart for different reasons than I like the rock garden cart that's why I like to keep them both this Moxie cart has a pre heat setting and that's nice but I also like it because you could change the temperature on it and as nicely as a puck because you can choose what kind of hit you want you get that fat cloudy one or you could get that low really tasty hit so I'm gonna take I'm gonna take a couple rips off of this before I took the blink on the marquee I'm not gonna lie the package says high potency oil it is I'm pretty baked right now and I still got that dab blowed it up yeah me trying to tempt the beans I can't do it I just end up doing like a regular French inhale I'm gonna take a drink of water before I attempt at the next blinker make sure you always keep something on you that stay hydrated this car does have me bait disguise and I think blues the medium on the Moxie cart on the Moxie battery but I'm not too sure cuz I'm getting mixed up cuz I'm the puff Co blue is like the lowest alright here we go Cheers oh my god these Eureka cards smack but let me know if you think I should start streaming I got a webcam I had for my PC am I trying plug it into my ps4 and see if it would connect I'll be just like hitting my car taking that explain to Kay Martin warfare on the ps4 I think I am gonna end up taking that dab yeah I got a nice type of Girl Scout cookies in here yeah you know what let me get the camera I'll show you all right here we go imma hit on the green setting I mean you know what let's hit on the red which is the high setting but it's not the highest the higher setting is the white all right double click it there we go blinking is warming up just bud Cheers [Music] [Music] damn that punk and dab could go yeah like what I said I would I would recommend the Eureka cart I got the London poundcake I think that's in the cups I'm not mistaken but it does Mac and it's pretty potent cars I'm gonna do one more trick I think I did it towards the end and take that big of a movie I must open my window or something my room's ball I don't know it's weird but I will end up getting it all right if you enjoyed the video make sure you like comment and subscribe and I'll see you in the next one [Music]", "p_VvQBxgu0A": "take a look at this faucet here this looks pretty sad so if you've got this going on in your kitchen this would obviously be called low water pressure but you may only have this issue when your kitchen this happens a lot as these get used a lot but they tend to get scale and build up and sometimes debris is something common that I get where I'm on a well so as you can see here this pressure is terrible so we don't want to live with this and I'm going to show you how to fix it and it's pretty easy tools you're going to need to do this job pretty easy bowl of water toothbrush and a pair of pliers so the first thing I'm gonna do is I've pulled the head off the faucet and I'm just holding it to see you can see a close-up these pliers I'm using have flat edges and the aerator on the end of this faucet is obviously removable so you turn it left to loosen it and as you can see I use the pliers to grip the sides and now I'm just unthreading it so right away I think you can see what the problem is here we've got a lot of debris and again I get iron because I have a well and immediately a lot of that's gonna fall right off but we're gonna do a little bit more of a thorough cleaning so that we only have to do this job once in a while so we're gonna use that toothbrush here and the reason I filled the bowl with water it seems obvious but once you've taken your faucet apart it's really a pain to go in another room and get some water so it's easier to just fill this up and save yourself some time so we're gonna dip this in I'm using the toothbrush to scrub it up basic stuff but if you've never taken it apart before it can seem kind of confusing but it's really not and as I take this apart you can see that there's really just three pieces you have the ring that it sits in this is what's called the aerator then all I'm doing here is scrubbing it and in the bottom of the bowl that's a black Oh ring but it's kind of flat so it's really not what you typically call in a ring so it's more of a rubber washer I guess is a better way to say it so this looks a lot better and pologize for the focus here but it's obviously crystal clear now and before that debris was clogging all those pores so I'm pretty confident that that was a problem so we're gonna scrub this just a little bit more make sure it's perfect so this is far from a glamorous job and I don't want to spend every day of my life doing this so here's another top tip you want to clean the inside where the aerator screws into and as you can see here because this is a removable head I'm just gonna scrub this up if your head doesn't remove you can go ahead and obviously just use the toothbrush on the top of the faucet so another tip before you put it back together it's really a good idea to turn the water on now be careful because the water is gonna blast out in here a lot differently than when we have the aerator on so just let the water run out I like to push the water back up a little bit that helps flush any little bits out you can still see some bits in the bottom of my sink coming out so I'm going to scrub this a little bit more maybe seems a little bit too much but again I only have to do this every two three years so I really want to be thorough so that I don't need a so already the water flow is looking a little bit better than me again I'm just scrubbing it clean alright moving right along we're gonna put this back together so again modern faucets and I mean modern in the past 15 years they're a lot simpler than they used to be they typically just have three pieces the metal ring the aerator which is that blue plastic piece and then that flat o ring washer that you're gonna use so that's always going to go on top and that's the part that connects into the part of the faucet that you could not remove so again the rubber seals it and then the aerator goes in and the metal ring is what threads it together so when you put this together it can slip a little bit so don't freak out if you go to put it in and it falls right out it can be very frustrating just take your time go gentle don't force it you absolutely want to thread this in by hand and make sure that it threads in smoothly and then once that happens and you feel like it's in there pretty good and you can see that even I'm having a little bit of trouble and that's totally common so just take your time thread it in and once it threads in and it feels pretty good now you can take your pliers don't go berserk tightening this up you'll break it right apart I just give it a little bit of a snug and you have that rubber washer in there so you can snug it about a quarter turn is usually a good idea all right moment of truth let's see how it looks that is about a thousand times better than what it was before so this is well worth the job let's take a little before shot of what we had before we did the cleaning look at that who wants that you get thrown out of the house with a faucet like that much much better this is a really simple job I hope this was helpful to you if you did I'd

on that new fortnight man I've been loving it but start off first thing in the morning with this and see how it does that gets real smooth has like a spicy aftertaste uh but all good all good what up everybody it's the next day this thing literally had me up all night super sativa man it literally keeps you going but it didn't give me that weird feeling where you get that a juror like damn I really don't like this it's a little too much it didn't get to that point it's just I don't know it's nice it's nice like get you very super motivated but don't give you that weird zing you feeling beautiful day out here today this thing tastes so good tastes just like like literally tastes like [Music] make sure y'all clean your hands staying clean stay away from my family store just for something to do put the dog dog super excited bouncing around yeah oh wait you guys [ __ ] rocket that subscribe button hit that like button hit that Bell [Music]", "iiMVNYAVfQo": "[Music] [Music] what's up everybody my name is Kenny tonight and this tonight [Laughter] what's going on everybody my name is Kenny tonight and this is the night dimension and today I want to talk to you guys about DMT pens and this may not be something that's been super popular in the culture or in the psychedelic society so you know so far to this point but I think that as time goes on people are talking about these things more to the point where I one of my friends actually asked me what I thought about DMT pens and the pros and cons of them so I wanted to just talk about that with you guys now right off the bat you would think DMT pen that's got to be a terrible idea because it's just gonna be abused by people and what a great way and what a great way to spread the love of these things by having people use them just like marijuana you know or a vape because that's what you would first think when you think Oh a DMT vape pen you know it's so what are the pros and cons and I think that right off the bat the con is right there abuse you could abuse the substance and we could pass a message of the substance that really isn't what we're trying to do with these things and you know honestly I think that's probably like the only con I mean that I can think of because that's what I was thinking about more and more as I really opened up to this topic because at first you that's what you think is a sort of negative perspective of it but as I'm thinking more and more you know what would be better having people be able to use a vape pen you know for people be able to use of a pen to smoked DMT rather than like a crack pipe or a bomb you know because this is an experience where you are going to be quickly taken you're yourself you know and your normal ability to have proper motor control and so it would be safer to have you to just be able to take a hit out of a pen put it down real quick and then you know go into the experience but then obviously it's so easy to just take another hit but then with DMT it only takes that third hit or up to that point where you just you know you can't stop it and you have to come down which is another thing that I wanted to talk about is that a lot of what's happening when you're heating up the glass or you're using whatever method to smoked DMT the temperature is super important so that's when I was thinking if we had a vape pen where we could correctly cook the DMT at a proper temperature at a proper rate you would be able to have the best experience because you'd be getting the most amount of dimethyltryptamine versus any other household version or anything like that so that was one of my final thoughts on the DMT vape pens would be is that it could be a definite thing that we could use in the future but it would be highly recommended that they be designed in some way to where you could only take a couple hits you know it's not going to be you know for those of you who can tell this is a marijuana vape pen so it has just you know it has the whole entire thing is the whole entire cartridge is filled with this liquid I could hit this thing all day you know but to be able to just maybe buy cartridges where you have a couple hits you know and then in order to be able to do another thing you have to put another one on or you know able to open it up and put a piece in there go at it you know put it down and that way it's more respectful and more ritualistic rather than just being able to use it whenever we want to so that's just my thoughts on the topic I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you guys want to help support the videos help me out in any way I have a one-time donation on PayPal if not you too speedy stuff like comment subscribe dev on the mother effin haters and I appreciate you guys I'll see you guys next

got a pod actually this is a cartridge I got a cartridge and I got a pod so you know right now I'm in the car I got I'm probably gonna end up driving so I'm not gonna do the review right now I'm gonna take you guys with me I'm gonna go over to my parents house today's the Super Bowl you guys is the Chiefs versus the 49ers but since it's like I'm not too big of a fan of football to be honest and I'm not too big either team I'm gonna be doing a review for you guys and I'm gonna just do a wholeheartedly like light you guys know well I personally think about pods and when I personally think about cartridges I think they're similar but they're different you know I'm saying so I'll check in with you guys soon all right shot so we just did a car swap and I'm driving my grandparents so you know all the same that's why didn't smoke but when I get there I'm doing the review it's gonna be dope as so stay tuned go 49ers just can't go what are you having the Super Bowl who do you thinks gonna win yeah who do you thinks gonna win I'm Francisco all the 49ers yeah alright that's a good call good call [Music] that's cool all right camera woman where are we going what kind of background do you guys want yeah I want to see the house are you guys gonna see this isn't bad this channel is strictly for viewers ages 18 plus I do not use or promote the sale of illegal drugs or harmful substances this video was recorded in California a legal recreational state under the laws Prop 64 alright Josh so this seems like a pretty good spot we're gonna my mom's backyard right now and it's cold as right now alright so let's get to it let's start with the cartridge so right here guys we got a cartridge nothing special right if you guys are watching this channel you guys should already be familiar with kind of like what cartridges it's a cannabis vape that uses oil and yeah it's pretty simple I wanna say when they cannabis base we first became a thing this is pretty much what everybody had or what everybody was going for it when they were trying to create their own product they were all creating cartridges so you were seeing like thousands of new cartridge brands hit the market and they're all kind of doing the same thing by throwing the oil in a tank which has an atomizer that allows you to burn the oil pretty simple and back in the day everybody's the thing these were bait partridges so this used to be low-key I would say nowadays this is far from it when people see a little cartridge or anything like this they automatically assume or think you're smoking some type of wheat or some type of cannabis so I would say that's the negative which used to be a pro for this but now that this is a negative I would say you're probably gonna see less people smoking this out in public or just you know more plainly like just taking random hits out in the open they're probably gonna start covering this up a little bit more originally cops didn't even really know what this was I feel like every cop every security guard if you go to a club if you go anywhere they automatically know where this is they're gonna either try to take it away from you you can't take this into Disneyland anymore so these are a lot of negativity to having cartridges I would say over pods nowadays just because everybody knows what it is but if you don't go  and the place that you're at really doesn't give a then is the same thing as smoking apart [Applause] alright y'all and this right here this is a plug play and what these are these are cannabis pods and pretty much it's the same thing the same exact oil that goes inside a cartridge you guys is the same world that goes inside of a pod it pretty much just takes a different shape so he now made it so that the cartridge doesn't look like an oil cartridge anymore or a standard small vape they made it look like more of a jewel so now I pods the only difference between the two our pods look like jewels and they're more low-key they have a custom device where they're not Universal and they don't all use the 510 connection where this this cartridge could go almost go on any date device that has the standard 510 threading and so it's very Universal where it pods this isn't gonna go and sit inside of a jewel it's not gonna fit inside of a steezy they all have their own unique device and that's okay oh yeah I would say they both have if they both have good oil they're both gonna have the same potency if they both have really good a good cartridge and they're both a good pot they're gonna have the same type of hit except nowadays when you take this places you can probably take this into the club you would take it almost into Disneyland museum parts because it looks more like a jewel it's more in the norm and it's more like people don't assume when you're hitting this that you're getting high off cannabis they think you're hitting that jewel and so it were trying to be more incognito and more low-profile more low-key I would say the way to go is pods nowadays for me personally since I have family members you know especially younger ones I'd really been thinking I'm hitting that jewel rather than me ingesting cannabis or hitting my cannabis vape all day long but if you guys enjoyed this video and you guys enjoyed hearing about the differences and kind of like my personal preferences between the two please drop a like drop a comment down below subscribe to your boy and I'll see you guys soon", "VPNksumOtHI": "in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video before before this video starts I just wanna let you guys know that I slapped on some sunscreen so I'm not all greasy and [ __ ] so if you guys want to know you know why I'm hella shiny and [ __ ] it's not cuz I'm sweating I mean I am sweaty not gonna lie I got mud butt right now but definitely I'm not one for my face you know it's just if I'm this greasy I'd never be this greasy you know man I hate the [ __ ] shower well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we're gonna be reviewing yet again another select cartridge this time accidentally you know throw in a row no a couple times where you know I had pretty much whole is gone where it's worth I think there's about like one-third of it left so it is a select once again it's the elite brand the select it's the pineapple express because he see its 85 85 percent THC so there's some good [ __ ] you know was good at the hybrid right here it's a hybrid right there so it kind of gets you a little bit of everything but here we have it everybody and like always check this out y'all check the song there you go you guys see that right there and you turn it around I see you notice that gauge that you know especially if it's clear you know I guess it's the more the clear the better especially man if you guys are smoking on some of that some of that dark [ __ ] man I see like I'm telling you guys one time I got I bought a fake brass knuckle cartridge right I smoked it up and you know after a couple days it was just turn in it was turning brown it was turning like the the oil was like really dark you know so like always everybody we're gonna turn this on we're gonna put him on the the lightest for the low temp he already knows good cheers everybody pineapple express select so if you guys watch the previous video I actually reviewed the ghost the ghost train haze cartridge with my boy Hoss you know so that [ __ ] was pretty good you know this year the Select I'm telling you guys it's the light cards man they get you freakin loaded man they get you they get you pretty lit and again I talked about in the previous if you guys want to go check that one out it's gonna be down a description it's some ghost ghost train Oh ghost train haze something like that yeah I think that's what it's called sativa so it's gonna wake you up but pretty much I was just talking about how like the flavor the flavor it doesn't have a really strong flavor whatsoever but then again it gets you super frequently like you taste it you know you know what you're smoking on you know you're smoking awesome THC you know [Music] as I was saying you know it's like the best part you can smoke this in public I mean like you know if you get the taste of it it does have like the distinct taste you know obviously if you're smoking THC so you're gonna know you know but the thing the thing that I really like about these is that the freakin smell is not strong whatsoever does not stick I'm telling you guys like right now I'm just saying this [ __ ] in my room you know it's not I'm gonna be able to open the door it might smell just a little bit but it's not gonna smell like super strong you know so that's one cool thing that I really like about these cartridges and select is some of the first cartridges is you guys if you guys know you guys were watching this channel select is a cartridge some of the first cartridges that I started smoking you know back when like you know wax pans and all this this and all this stuff was like new you know it's this [ __ ] this three alright we're gonna switch it up to blue to the middle temperature damn blue is just perfect because this again this doesn't really have like a big taste to it it hasn't it's crazy to me also like cartridges for me they all taste the same it really depends on the percentage because I know select has a couple I think it was select pretty sure I'm 100% I'm actually ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent sure that select it used to have some of these or still does but I don't know what you could get them but select has these carts that are like what like a point three in a cartridge and it's like super strong it's like high maybe like in the mid 90s low 90s I think 90 to 95 percent maybe even 96 percent who knows but I do remember there was like they're really small and you would just rip it you take one good rip and damn man you'd get [ __ ] blasted I know a lot of you guys really like these cartridges reviewing videos it's crazy man it's like the new thing right personally me cartridges are I mean I guess you're cool you know especially when you go to like family parties and you're at the house you know you want to step outside and smoke you know smoking this is pretty far you know because you can just do it work you know you're taking a [ __ ] you sit down on the toilet you're taking this [ __ ] you give you a hint in this you know if it was waterproof you giving in into the shower but you know when you're laying down you're watching the movie huge puffing on this [ __ ] but to be completely honest with you guys I get lit but it's like it's just like a head heart you know it's nothing it's nothing too crazy you know like I don't get beg debate so I mean I I'm actually lying there has been a couple times where this is so spire that I guess you made it I guess faked I not believe I like this one you can barely tell it's like a little different taste these like cartridges especially these ones right here they all have like a similar taste but I'm lit man personally let me know the comments down below what you guys like better you know and you guys like either cartridges or flowers especially mean I like the flowers you know a lot of dabs and everything I like flowers I mean dabs are cool you know cuz again you can take them here in the crib you know you get super baked like dad or you just trying to get bang foot you know if it fits up if I'm starting my day with dads man all right be my date man I'm gonna just be slump I'm gonna just be hella tired so that's why I kind of wished it up you know I kind of I'm gonna start to take like then dad's you know at nighttime you know or man especially if you guys are gonna watch a movie you guys are gonna eat but it's like you know later in the day where you just don't really have nothing to do and yeah because sometimes if you died man your soul it I mean it it's honestly depending on you guys you know you're gonna go with the highest it's a bit depends on on your guys its body type like let me know what you guys get productive you guys get lazy cuz there's either one or the other bros tree and either THC all there's others only [ __ ] oh I can tell it was a weekday let's make some nice clothes but personally mean I don't like that height I'm you know I feel like it just burns through all this [ __ ] damn I thought I completely forgot what the [ __ ] I was talking about oh yeah okay so either either it makes you or it breaks you like personally me what it does to me is when I usually smoke or whatever and if it's like a sativa it's gonna pick me up it's gonna pick me up and it gets me really like creative I start thinking about you know different ideas and so for me personally me I feel like it relaxes me and I could definitely be way more creative I mean I'm already creative sober but it's like you know it's like sometimes for example like like earlier today you know have a little short [ __ ] die last night I didn't really have that much to sleep or whatever you know I don't take take a few puffs you know get a little lit and I'm just like damn bro I think about you know I started getting in my head and I started thinking and usually when I get on my head I'm just like dude I got to do this I got to do that like oh [ __ ] let's do it now you know and I take action so sometimes for me tree regardless I mean sober or this you know I'm gonna be [ __ ] creative productive but sometimes this [ __ ] is like there's days where I'm kind of like look I feel like I have like I feel like I can't think of [ __ ] or I'm just kind of like [ __ ] I'm just like chillin there you know and I'll get lady and I'm just like boom [ __ ] this pie it's just a sativa you know it really depends indica it gets me a little tired it'll also be the same but I'll be kind of like slung but there's other people who they're gonna just have a sash that I said and they're not productive at all you know they don't really get nothing done during the day they just throw the whole day around you know and I've had days like that that's why sometimes I'm just like [ __ ] man I gotta start doing that [ __ ] you know I gotta stop [ __ ] you know but again you know people do you know a lot of people look down on Chief and stuff like that but I'm telling you guys sometimes if this [ __ ] could give you literally like just a weird and blue sometimes that happens sometimes it doesn't you know sometimes I'm late I'm still doing [ __ ] but over time you kind of just get to learn how to like what your body likes like for me if I stay I like to smoke sativa all the time it doesn't matter if it's a day nighttime sativa cuz actually picks me up and I'm just [ __ ] like a machine bro you know just [ __ ] do it [ __ ] and I'm just lit out of my mind and I'm just like dude what the [ __ ] I just did all the [ __ ] you know and I'm just late I was really like it was just everything was naturally happening if that makes sense you know I don't know I'm I'm horrible at explaining [ __ ] everyone damn so liked everybody make sure you guys go check them out man if you guys the only thing that I would say I guess what kind of suck is that the flavors aren't really that strong you know it's like you you do get a flavor but when they say like for example like different stuff like this pineapple Express definitely I had like a different taste you know especially like other cartridges they throw in like a little extra flavor to make it think like Oh like a pineapple type you should hide Apple Express or some [ __ ] but you know you you just know you're getting the extract from this sharing or from some legit pineapple Express you know the book is lit man if you guys owe a good thing I would I would totally recommend this brand and this these cartridges it's like cartridges especially if you guys don't want to if you don't wanna like hotbox your room or some [ __ ] you guys are burning like in the bathroom real quick you guys have a quick sesh you know cuz the smell isn't that strong there's no like stick to it like rock gardens oh my god they have like a crazy like leafy it's it's a [ __ ] it's it's a strong a smell on the other [ __ ] you know they have they have strong smells of [ __ ] down [ __ ] late cuz I do not shut the [ __ ] up I got a chatterbox anyways you guys thanks for watching like always soon everything we have from dispensary man in Italy some flowers so thank you guys for watching like

dead Darfur 24 can have babies we love your reviews dude you are so luckily to live where you are to be able to get some bomb-ass cards hello now these are like what are the most expensive cards I have gotten I've never pay like 50 a little bit over 50 bucks it was almost a little bit over 50 bucks almost not over 60 though so I'm really excited these cartridges are new they just hit my dispensary I looked them up on Instagram I have like 2000 followers so they're just like kind of new to the market as well but these these are like alright these are game changers you know as you guys can see the on the side that says it what's a sale man it says less than the 2 v battery you know you don't to burn it and it says distillate free guys this is not a distillate cartridge this is a straight liquid diamond sauce car I've never had a liquid diamond sauce card I've never seen a review on YouTube there was only one guy who did a review there IRS's it's an ice cream cake and yeah this should be pretty bomb you know the it's full gram I don't know where these guys in their Humboldt County so yeah guys we're gonna get in straight to so you have this little button here press this button hey let me show you guys a little close-up ice cream cake and it's a 76 percent THC what I think yeah 76 percent so yeah guys this is pretty dope you know the everyone that the shot was telling these are pretty far and we're gonna go ahead and see I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys know I love rock garden and [ __ ] but I'm gonna see if these are better than raw garden so you know I've never had a liquid diamond sauce car which it says there is pretty dope you know so if you guys ever see these be on the lookout so as a little button there and you got impress it and you gotta twist it off slow sticker pull out I don't break the damn thing oh [ __ ] Wow looks pretty dope guys so we're glad mom how do you do this do you just pop it up just pop it out and bam down this is a pre feels pretty good no nice and heavy the oil looks pretty decent you know it looks kind of different from what other cartridges would look like gots nice little day in there but you get a full ground because I I was reading their information on Instagram as well you know if there's a big day is because the Okoye in there has a nice big koala as you guys can see you know it's a pretty nice big coil in there so it's what it does is the coil sucks up some of the oil in there so that's what put some damp but you guys took it you're full ground you know I'm saying yeah I ain't getting ripped off or nothing like that so like I said these this is probably like the second Ursula review on YouTube guys there's gonna be you know these cartridges just hit the market so I don't know how long they've been out but I heard they taste like exactly like [ __ ] like if you're taking adapt hey you know what I mean like straight really it's it's is it I'm think no distillate so I'm gonna flip it over hold it for a little bit this is a distillate free cartridge guys it's just gonna be fire as [ __ ] it was like 55 bucks you know out here 55 bucks for cartridges it's kind of expensive you know and with tax on top of that so we're to be him I'm going to try hit those imma see if I have some flavors but I'm sorry you do get a little clean taste like a live resin like what's it called like a raw garden would taste like so you don't really get like in a specific flavor to it now I want to let you guys know um I just hit that criteria for for YouTube to be for my channel to be monetized so I'm not really really excited you know I'm really hoping you know the channel pays off that we can help the channel grow buy more products and [ __ ] like that so you know for you guys and as if it wasn't for you guys I would never got my channel monetize you know it's [ __ ] crazy so if you guys ever see ads on the videos don't [ __ ] skip them guys watch those ads watch them all please it really helped me a lot in the channel but thank you guys you know you guys are awesome so we're just gonna go numb we're going to hit this and I'm let you guys know if it's really worth it or not you know what I mean but cheers guys if you guys are smoking out with me go ahead and do so take a little hit just to get some flavors I could taste it oh wow the flavors guys I would describe it is if you guys took a literally a [ __ ] DAP it oh wow that's crazy so it literally tastes like some real real wax guys they don't taste like a cartridge you know this thing is amazing the flavor I would describe it like if you would take like a literally a dab of the raw garden taste like waxy clean taste to it it's [ __ ] bomb but you don't really get like an ice cream it's an ice cream cake strain so you don't really get the ice cream cake in it but you do really get this like I could cushy like a clean taste cushy taste it is so good it tastes so clean I'm gonna go ahead and hit this again I might hit it a little longer and try and kill myself at awaken Bay but cheers guys hope you guys are smiling on with me mo oh wow most definitely I will be getting some more of these this one's only flavored they had it was a ice cream cake I'm not heard they had like a banana oh gee they have a lemon tree but I'm I shot the only Hodgins ice cream cake but if you guys ever see this ice cream cake you guys got a copy I'm not [ __ ] around with you I'm over-exaggerating it sings fire I'm not playing it tastes exactly like [ __ ] dab it tastes so like that's so real like it's crazy I'm sure you guys the packaging again so you guys can see you know it's distillate free or 100% cannabis which is pretty dope you know the thing these are game changers right here you know liquid diamond sauce cards these are actually liquid diamond sauce cars not no [ __ ] and the cartridge itself you know they got to it's really cool they got the nice new ceramic tip on there everything's ceramic on the cartridge I'm pretty sure cuz it looks pretty dope guys so if you guys if you guys want to go on Instagram and look up Ursa to get some more information or you know just to check the cartridges out for you guys itself and I also seen some cartridges that had like some fuzziness and they're like they actually know like I had some actual accidents so it just depends on the cartridge you guys get well but hope you guys are ready for that Super Bowl if you got a Niner fans like this V no comment you know I'm a big man of fun as well hopefully we win it probably just a barbeque that day tomorrow

thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "JVvjqk9nMJI": "you know what is going on guys today [ __ ] you would think after [ __ ] years I would have a different intro I hate seeing that but getting in front of camera is like really awkward for me still test now this new best dab pen compared to my last one this baby still rips it's called pulse battery $80 on dispensaries but now I believe it's down to $60 so if you want to actually I can't promote selling things or buying in these videos so don't [ __ ] buy it okay may have unboxed it already now may I put it back in the package just for this but comes in the little

here let me let me just [ __ ] pan over for you guys alright alright this what we're looking at this is the new guy little arrow Pro sweet little box but basically it takes different carts than a normal one like these ones you know any normal cart goes on that but these ones check it out alright don't [ __ ] blame you for my camera skills I don't even know what the [ __ ] I'm doing here okay yeah you take this damn it's a [ __ ] magnet needing this no button nice [ __ ] dough compared to this one this one rips but there's a button it's gonna be a smoke you wanna hear today whoo yo beam in our cameras [ __ ] dough I'm gonna review these [ __ ] carts now we got this badass pen now we got to put a car in it okay we obviously did that it's the Northern Lights is what we're having it is a 86% you know me I'd be rocking with the indicas I don't know about you guys put in the comments what's your favorite strain I'm really obsessed with indica cuz honestly I just like to smoke alone you know I still get my [ __ ] done because we can't have stoners out here not getting their [ __ ] done I still be getting stoned and going about my day it's gonna work he had done about to be moving so hopefully I make a vlog out of that skirting my way out of [ __ ] Idaho back to the hometown Seattle where Lee ro weed is legal so I don't get no more [ __ ] trouble here been in way too much trouble lately with the law first strain ever invented and it was because this dude grew in Alaska and like Aurora lights you know the Northern Lights in Alaska went over the weed and weed before this was never a green it was always red grown by Mexicans but when this dude drew it in Alaska with the aurora lights it turned green for the first time so he called it the Northern Lights and the second ever strain was alaskan thunder [ __ ] from Alaska as well obviously BAM first two strains I actually really like this these flavors good as [ __ ] just don't know it but I've been sitting in this chair for like 15 minutes just on my phone [ __ ] hitting the dab pen I totally [ __ ] forgot about the video I was just getting stoned sitting here um anyways let's move on wait let me take another rip I'm gonna give this a score 1 out of 10 but I'm gonna I'm gonna give you that like a seven we are now having wedding pie it is a 82% in because well you know how it is I always be wrong with the indica

don't call me a [ __ ] but my the [ __ ] alcohol is trying to come out I'm gonna give that a six out of ten maybe a seven sis I'll go 6.5 pull it out okay next one the OG bubba kush indica of course i only go with the indica sativa sometimes when I'm working but most of time I say [ __ ] it and I just at work hi I'm kidding I'm kidding my [ __ ] employer finds this well sir we have a 90 percent coming in at 91% for bubba kush let's test it out damn this so bright that I look white oh wait I am white I just look pale suppose all right not gonna lie another [ __ ] ten minutes has gone by of me just sitting here doing nothing cuz I'm so [ __ ] stoned like I've just lost track of time I don't even know what one I'm on oh I'm on the bubba kush okay i'll give that like an eight matter of fact I'm gonna bump the other ones up to the first one was honestly the best I want to give the first one like a nine now I don't know what I gave it before but it probably wasn't the [ __ ] nine wedding Paiwan [ __ ] me up also wedding pie is the only door cord all right end result Northern Lights nine wedding pie 7.5 bubba kush hmm probably an 8 probably an 8 this one is fruity pebbles or Strawberry Cough honestly I've lost so many [ __ ] cards I don't know which flavor is which okay is smaller this one was more expensive this was a little cheaper just because I got it on a sale at the dispensary all right boys that's been the [ __ ] video I'm going to turn this camera off and sleep actually it's Sunday so I'm gonna watch the football game Packers are on in three hours let's go I almost forgot to do one more red", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel give this video a thumbs up if it was helpful if it wasn't then drop in the comments how we can

forum so making this review possible now y'all know I'm I this is one of my favorite CBD companies their flower is amazing if you haven't seen it reviews are linked I'm at the end and I am so blessed to be able to experience their cartridges yes and it sent over a few but we're gonna take it one by one we ran into Jack come on suck it this is really chop roof I mean we don't get this open all right got it but I like that cuz yeah I can't office yeah let's get into it focus jack herer my same is right Herrera Hera OC so we're getting into Jack Herrera and it's a sativa strain 63% CBD under 0.1% TAC so what it is not going to get you high but it's gonna make you feel a hella good cannabis derived terpenes Oregon made the package is made 400 side plant base yeah I like that it's very serious about the environment so that's your your cart it came with a cap [Music] so with the sativa dominant strain and what do I get from it so piney woodsy kind of tastes like it's really again giving me a herb well I think all of so that what I'm getting from it I got notes is the earthy pine woodsy taste all them to come together this is giving you a look at her beau blend you know when I first started very benign I was like okay this is a little it's kind of little peppery but not so much so I put it more towards to her beau side and for me what it is this a cheaper strain so I found myself to be very focused very focused and I chose us in particular because I was doing before I was getting ready for work and I'm like you know I let me not mess up and do something that's not put me to sleep now I would definitely recommend this if you're about to do some work whether it be gardening whether it be school work because like I said for me it has has it had me focused and I like that and this is something I would do definitely in the morning yeah before I start my day definitely we recommend again it's an earthy Pineywoods he kinda tastes enjoyable you want aces this um see like lesson pressing in here putting it yeah somebody answer I see we burn in your throat yeah yeah this is not this doesn't bring it though that's important so it's smooth yeah it doesn't burn your throat and again this one for me it's just a cheaper so but against the TV affects people differently some people sativa it affects them like it's an indica this just kept me very alert so I definitely recommend that you give them a try I'm really happy that they also do cartridges and we're going to get into more about them so stay tuned you know where you get all the information to get

anything since that video so this is gonna be a fun one this is gonna be a great one um the reason I was gone is I had a lot of school I had to do some I was working I'm still working now but I was I was getting a lot of support on the last videos I didn't think I was planning on smoking anymore or doing any more videos but like I said there was a ton of support I'm at like 47 subscribers you guys

select elite so y'all know it's gonna be fire already and since I haven't smoked in two weeks I'm about to get dumb blasted so I'm pretty excited uh the THC is running in at ninety point four five percent here which is pretty dang insane right there lets you look at the blocks for a second and I won't focus so you can't read it but there you go it says here it's supposed to tape tastes like grape sweet and earthy so that's cool and it's supposed to give you a relaxed happy euphoric feeling so that's cool they say it right there on the box I don't have planned videos for the next few we got two of them right here if you know their colors you know whether they're in because the TVs are hybrids its blah blah blah those will be coming here pretty soon um yeah so like I said it's been a minute so might seem like a little weird of a review I'm kind of trying to get back into it trying to think of how how I did it so let's just uh let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open here ah [ __ ] so actually let me tell you because I always see hey seam reviews on whatever it is and not knowing the price so the dispensary I went to was Metro meds I here in Phoenix Arizona let's see this select God gift cart right here I paid $80 for this but it was a buy one get one basically so to 480 it wasn't a biome but they always do two for 80 deals so yeah so I got this and then I got another full gram for 80 bucks so 40 bucks each basically and then I got a eighty sativa yeah well I'll tell you guys now I got a higher no that's anyway I got a hybrid half gram here which I don't think I I might have reviewed a hybrid I don't quite remember I'll have to go back and look at those um I just was charging this pen a little bit it wasn't getting full charge and I charged it for like 10 20 minutes so I don't know that's alright though uh well let's go ahead and pop this bad boy open oh no I remember you guys you kind of got to open it from the bottom these parts because if there's some long ass fingers to get to the top for some reason and poke it out stupid ass blocks and [ __ ] blah blah yeah maybe not you know this box isn't even childproof and I can't even get through it Jesus okay there we go there we go wow it's been a minute since I have touched a cart let alone a full gram cart that is one big [ __ ] that's good okay just real quick I wanted to say this cuz I was thinking about it if I don't have a video in the next few days it's because it's gonna be hard for me to it's gonna take a minute for me to get adjusted and smoke a full gram pretty fast so I'm not gonna quit again it's just gonna take a minute for me to get this done and then put out a new one so [ __ ] I'm very excited because I mean I know it's have to give me like the craziest high in the world but hopefully it should smack me pretty goddamn well um let's go ahead and screw it on the dr. zodiacs chew Moonrock clear battery there hi you already know I like that little fine point tip better than those round ones because they get less dirty well I told you guys the type of car brand price dispensary I don't think I told you guys about everything let's uh oh except for the liquids you already know peace tea still haven't sponsored me that's okay they're gonna one day don't worry pop that open go ahead take a sip hydration break yep hell yeah man hell yeah all right if you guys are smoking on anything in the what what I guess you guys are smoking on anything let me know down in the comments I'm always excited to know what y'all smoking oh by the way if you hear any random noises like squeaky toys I brought a foster dog home again that the owners were dog [ __ ] that's another story maybe I'll explain that at one point but those are what those noises are so cheers guys oh [ __ ] you oh yeah that's that's definitely a snack you're right on the first like inhale God dang that is hole [ __ ] I definitely get that earthy feel for your version dammit dammit weird though I'm definitely feeling it already like I just thought that's weird that's weird how it hits god damn well I already like it says it's supposed to taste sweet / creepy and earthy the only thing I'm really getting out of it is is that earthy taste not getting really anything sweet there maybe I'm you know like that much sweetness that's about it so yeah you know that's alright that's alright you're not usually in the cards for for taste that's for those nicotine vapor guys sucks to beat them and they're getting [ __ ] end of the stick people are dying from these poisonings and these black-market cards and these guys are taking this the beating for it because people think it's believing that's pretty rough I kinda want to make a video on unlike the fake cards I might buy I know a few people I sell some TKO some banks and all that [ __ ] I might buy one of those in compare them I really want to do that I think I've said it multiple times in some videos but I really really do want to do that cuz it's pretty bad out there man y'all like some smoke and some boof and I mean I've done it before you know it happens you gotta do it sometimes but if I knew what was seen him down what was happening to the kids that are doing it now I win it so I just want to say if you all just look at some tanks some TKOs some exotics I was looking a lot of exotics by the way be careful be very careful try not to smoke them I know it's it's easier for me to say it to you because I have dispensary cards and all that but it's not worth it guys yeah you're not even getting that real high you're getting that synthetic [ __ ] you didn't pesticides you can ascertain E which you know that's just no bueno just be careful guys they thing's not gonna kill you if y'all are in the nicotine I'm not that's not gonna kill you vaping this stuff isn't gonna kill you is this even considered to be me I think it's vaping yeah yeah that's vaping this isn't gonna do anything it's gonna be those black market cards so if anybody's all like at school here hit my pen and be like the [ __ ] to get that homie and he's gonna be like I got it from Joe down the street at Casa de ghetto and he's gonna be like it's straight fire dawg it's straight fire he got it from the dispensary bro and you're gonna hit it and you're gonna [ __ ] die so just just be careful you know all right well let's do another one cheers guys mmm yep yep hello key I feel like my lungs aren't strong enough anymore no I know that you boys weak I used to be the I used to be the God you know hydrogen break I just had my [ __ ] lip boys I

I'm gonna end it there be sure to like subscribe do all that [ __ ] deuces", "VSyat0Zod40": "[Music] simplistic here back with another video this is going to be another bait cartridge for piyah Terry battery I would say I don't know if this is a 5-10 threading battery but it definitely looks different than your you know your typical 510 batteries usually they're like a pencil like cut the [ __ ] I mean they don't usually look like this but I mean similar and uh it's a cartridge as well and you can see I got the flavours sweater this is one of the sweaters they actually gave me it's probably like the only sweater a cat that gave the rest away but yeah I like to I like this color I got some water stains oh yeah this says AeroPro advanced vapor system premium carrying case not included but this box includes a vaporizer micro USB charger u.s. user guide and aluminum alloy body with the 320 milliamp per hour battery running it 8.5 power or 8.5 wattage power output so arrow pros advanced ceramic cartridge technology specifically designed for pure oils delivers superior performance and taste also has a one-year warranty as well to speak but it does say distillate so you know as far as just let's go they usually taste the same in terms of what terpenes they use when it whether it be fruity or whatever but this one apparently is Northern Lights two indica so let's just open some of these up so for uh what I mean by proprietary battery is batteries that you the cartridges only work for that specific battery I'm not saying like this is a proprietary battery or whatever like a rock garden car tree earth semi GE luck he likes to say proprietary battery a lot but proprietary battery only means when the powder you express it just like a plug-and-play like the only thing that's gonna work with the plug-and-play battery is a plug-and-play cart the raw garden carts you can use with any 510 threading cartridge the voltage might not be running as good for that specific cartridge because the raw garden cartridge is gonna run good for its own cartridges but you could still use it and that's that's what proprietary means it's it that only works for that you know 5-10 threading batteries raw iron batteries for all 510 threading so like this just make that clear you know just like he means well but that's what it means yeah and a lot of people don't really like proprietary batteries because it's like well I got to get this battery or this [ __ ] cartridge when you know 510 threading cartridges are Universal on most batteries so I do feel it but this one it kind of does look like this so it is a five strand by ten threading I believe [Music] in queen I also got my cousin on my bed back so we're gonna open this right off the bat when I took it out it smells really it smells like that the distillate like fire oh jeez from plug play like that very earth the tiny taste so I'm guessing this is just the then you take out okay hey so you charge on the bottom as well microUSB and like I said it's a 320 milliamp per hour battery so it's fairly alright I believe this one's like 400 so probably can get a decent amount of use before you have to charge it so so there is no button you just hit it and then those are light right here so we're just gonna hit it okay so you guys didn't see that because obviously you have to have like crazy-ass heists to see that but this actually vibrated while I was hitting it so you don't actually need to look at the light to see if you're actually getting anything because with this list sometimes you don't even know you're hitting it because it's a it's a very thin oil or I don't know what it's not really thin but yeah it's just sometimes when you're inhaling this lis it's sometimes you don't get the sensation that it's actually going into your lungs so the vibration is actually a good touch and I've actually seen this from Desmet before they had a few prototypes they let me try but they kind of look like this but they vibrated as well but this is the first American company I seen that implemented it so pretty good as far as the taste goes it kind of tastes like [ __ ] licorice I don't really like licorice okay you smell this real quick it's mostly it's not sweet has like a weird aftertaste I'm not really a fan of it but I will be smoking on it because until pretty I don't know I'm not a fan of licorice taste but you know like sweets I do and you like candy and [ __ ] yeah but not like one like sweet meat [ __ ] but overall I'm probably gonna try another one of these actually this is a proprietary battery I believe because this cartridge has the metal magnetic attachment stuck on it so you would have to have this cartridge to work with this battery so it is a proprietary battery in itself but overall it's a pretty pretty nice looking product not gonna lie it is running at 80% THC so it's definitely in the mid-range when it comes to cartridges and yeah I'm probably to take one more hit and we're gonna end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it this is 0.5 as well and as far as pricing goes you're gonna probably put it in the post edit process because I don't know and there is good vapor production I'm not gonna lie that you pretty much saw all that cloud that came out other than that I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]", "tHXXQbLYmP8": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive all right guys back here for another freaking video you already know what it is and if you don't know my name my name is shakka zulu um thanks for freaking watching the video clicking on the video but um today is going to be another freaking review but today i'm going to review um a strain that the people from my freaking live stream wanted me to freaking try out and it is runs guys finally got me one of those rent carts because um a lot of people in my live stream said do the runs over the lemonade and then also like i bought this mainly because a lot of people um saw me do the geo pin and i showed that they had runs for geopin and they want me to do the runs for geopin but i don't want to use the geopin so i just got the 510 thread one so i got the oh obama runs guys let's go but before i get into it you know your boy has to take a rip smoking on the roach right now [Music] and if you haven't seen the video on this i made a video on this it's a disposable um cartridge it's called a roach if you want to check that out it's up there on the screen in the corner but um let's get into it guys so i decided to do runs and runs is actually powered by cookies guys there are um a couple brands that are powered by cookies maybe more but the three main brands are runs lemonade and mints if you guys are cookies fans you kind of know those are the main strains that are the main companies that are powered by cookies but um today we just got the runs and whoo and the runts is also let me sit down for a second let me let me walk over here and sit down so the runts is a lot it's a live sauce i'm pretty sure that's what you call it or it's just a sauce car period as you can see it's kind of golden it's not as dark as a live resin but it's pretty dark and that's because of the added terps if you guys don't know the difference between a disc jillet and a sauce cart it's not much of a difference but distillate when you make distillate usually all the original terpenes are taken out when you make that distillate so what they do to make a sauce cart is they add terpenes back into it to make it a sauce so it's distillate basically with terpenes in it let me get you guys a close-up real quick so you can see the golden goodness today i got the runts and i also have another lemonade but that'll be in another vlog i'll let you guys know when that drops soon before i go into that hit actually let me freaking tell you guys the content in it so it says thca 10 53 milligrams it says delta 9 thc 55 278 milligrams and then it says cbd two milligrams so we got delta tac and then taca they don't even have just you know usually they just have thc on it but they're actually telling you the type of thc that is in this pack so i'm gonna just take this first rib you know just to get the taste and everything and then i'll take a blinker head for you guys because you know i gotta take a blinker head every time i get a new car i gotta take a blinker head at least one on the new cart so let's go okay so off top this is definitely very terpe very sweet and if i didn't say so before it's obama runs it's actually not that bad guys [Music] [Music] so yeah guys man this [ __ ] is like definitely very terpy you can definitely taste the terps but it's also earthy at the same time so maybe it's actually freaking terps that are derived from the actual strain that they made the cart with but it's freaking fire guys oh my goodness this is way better than definitely way better than the last strain that i got i think it was called like metal in or something like that i'll put it on the screen the strain but fire shout out to runs i make some good ass [ __ ] powerball cookies but yeah guys it's just a chill day um today i'm just relaxing i just got off of work got back home you feel me i might live stream i don't know but if you guys want me to live stream like i said man i say this in

experienced it has leaked all in here and then this top parts right here actually does connect I'm too scared to disconnect it it's very easy to pop off and the oil spilled out I got leakage it came with a pretty good screw at the bottom look red little plug that go in the bottom of the cartridge you know like it was stopping it I thought I had it I thought oh this one ain't gonna leave it did leave matter of fact I'm going to show you what brand of years I thought I can hold off and show y'all but I can't here it is this is the brand okay that how's that - they're leaked on my ass and I spent my money on it thinking that it was gonna be good thinking that everything was cool I'm pissed because in a couple of days this right here gonna be gone unless I find some way just sit here and say I couldn't wait to tell you guys this I wanted to tell you like later after happened but I wanted to show you on the date of this being the 28th of May 20 19 that this is what happened to me and I had this like a full to the top and I only took a couple hits off of it and they started leaking on me and like I said this sucker right here can actually come pull it off I just won't pull it off because I'm pissed and all my oil keep going every time I make mistake and pull it off its manufacture got to get it together guys to get it together and also another problem I'm having the cartridge that goes to these pens they're Universal cartridge I do believe I challenge any manufacturer to make a better charger the little charger with the little light that turns red to green and stuff a little black when I wish I could show you I want right now actually I do have one sorry about the movement had a camera people but it's these low doohickeys right here okay now this one per se I haven't had a problem with but it's ones that have a little I don't know you know what I'm gonna say this is gonna be across the board because they need to make these better and stronger mines popped open I've had a few of these pop okay and you know I can still use them but you know the inside the meat of it is exposed and I can't really do you know excuse me I can't just I'm just frustrated I'm so frustrated to where I'm doing this video just early in the morning and yeah it's all over the place and I do apologize for that for that but I just wanted to let you guys know what I'm going through with this tip right here from this manufacturer and what I was going through with this thing right here miss you girl boo bringing it to you this morning had to add ghee the truth piece", "tEsMD-d72_g": "hmm so hopefully this is centered guys but what's going on YouTube today guys I just wanted to make a quick little video because honestly it's been a long day so I'm not really like in the spirits to make a video but I do want to make a video you know I want to have a video made for you guys tomorrow because I've been keeping it consistent so this is my attempt to making a video on a lazy day well even though it's been productive so into the introduction to the video topic today guys I'll be showing you guys my favorite baddie battery baddie for short [ __ ] and then we're gonna be show it we're gonna be going into higher def of the Alpine live resin cartridges we're gonna be hitting both the gorilla glue number 4 and the true OG it's just gonna be a chill sesh imma be telling you guys what I like about these products and why I choose the stick it was battery over other batteries because as you guys know I have had the opportunity to try so many batteries as of late and they've been great there's been a lot of great ones there's been a lot of bad ones so I want to tell you guys why I choose this one over the other ones that I've tried so far so since it is already gonna be night time I'm gonna go ahead and hit this with the indica first I shot my head with the hybrid first gorilla glue number four and then we're gonna go straight into the true orgy right after we're gonna had a piece of lint in my freaking mouth so right here guys you got the girl the glue number four not sure if that's focused in or not but gorilla glue number four and got the battery fully charged dude so go ahead and screw that on here and man it's kind of hot it's it's spring time already yeah like I think it officially hit spring and it's starting to get hot the worm is starting to kick in man and it's finally not cold which is cool you know even though I enjoyed the cold I definitely didn't enjoy the days that it was so so freezing to the point where I had to be covered in two blankets but if you guys are 18 you know where 21 over make sure you guys are hitting this along with me let me know what you guys are hitting in the comments below man it has been a long day my mind it's kind of like scattered right now like I said I didn't I wasn't going to make a video but here I am for you guys the dedication and consistency so whose battery my resident Alpine gorilla glue number four cheers boys ooh there's so amazing about Alpine vapora has to have by far the best gorilla glue number four in the world dude they nail it to the point to the point and for sure so when taking another hit and then I'm probably gonna [ __ ] do you know I'm probably gonna just turn the air on for a little bit oh sure I just cracked the window it is a beautiful little day-out pledge crack the window a little bit this one too and we're gonna take another hit and I'm gonna tell you guys why I like this battery more than any other battery that I've tried so far so I'm actually packing it closes because there's people playing music and I don't want their music to overlap mine so just gonna have to stick with the air on us can barely hear anyways man that is amazing right already starting to sweat man these summer days these spring and summer days are so amazing it's definitely one of my favorite seasons to smoke in by far I do not enjoy any other season than summer scene the smoking like just being able to enjoy smoking at any place like outside especially dude that was the biggest hurt of the winter and the cold season I was not being able to smoke outside so onto the importance of this battery man so this battery it costed me I think 15 bucks I bought this myself this isn't sponsored at all by use this was a hundred percent me I went to go buy to smoke shop when I was waiting on some other batteries survive and they didn't arrive on time and I had some product knowledge like you know what I dude I'm just even go out and buy a battery because I want to hurry up and try this so I never go into my local smoke shop and they had this battery and it really stood out because I have seen I had seen him around but I thought they were just cheapy batteries and then honestly this was this was the best quality one at that smoke shop and then I was like you know whatever just give it to me give it to me 15 bucks isn't too bad so I bought it and when I opened yeah I was like I was like oh wow like it wasn't as cheap as I thought it was gonna be so I looked in like I got it looked into it and then the material is very very nice the finish is the kind of has like a matte finish they have different colors obviously I just chose the green because it was the best one that they had and one thing that I like about this the first thing that really caught my attention was the variable wattage is on the bottom the turn knob so for $15 the fact that you're getting variable wattage with a turn knob is amazing dude bad batteries out here charging literally 25 to 30 dollars for something like this and they're ugly they're fat batteries and this one is just so thin and so like clean looking and nice and it goes up um it's from 3.3 volts all the way up to four point eight so that's pretty nice who is you really did a good job man they have the little holes right here that you could put any cartridge on this no air flow airflow restriction will be added on so like I said man this this is a very very nice battery and this is why I like it over other ones because you could fit anyone it's stealthy light not like the other ones you know it's nice having it's nice having the other batteries that you can do cool stuff like the preheat function but when do you honestly need a pre heat engine if you're using a cartridge you should always have it upside upside no matter what or else you are already like not taking care of your cartridges because you as if you do know you're not supposed to be having them upside down because you're losing oil so girl Lagoon report amazing dude it gives you such a heavy and nice high actually not even heavy just such a nice high the the notes on it is very very piney very very like a little bit hint of citrusy but more of the piney scent and it's very amazing if you guys don't know gorilla glue number four is my favorite strain by far so we're hopping into the true OG a heavy indica right here oh gee for sure so slapping on the battery and then the for the Alpine you're supposed to be hitting them at 3.7 I'm hitting at this one a 3.8 even because that's where the little dot is that and we're going to turn off the air and then when they see what kind of how massive hits we get at this so true oh gee live resin here we go boys Cheers Oh yup I don't know about you guys but obviously every og is an OG for a reason right so but I don't know if this is just me but or if you guys can tell me but I taste in every og I taste this kind of a similarity which is weird because I've tried strains that are like have the same strain specific strain in it and it tastes different you know you can barely or you can barely even taste it so the fact that they can consistently get this flavor across although g-strings for me personally is pretty crazy but true OG definitely a heavy hitter man whoa just those little hits right there you got me free a super hit highs right off the bat it's a little bit more of a dirty or high for me I like the girl igloo number four it's perfect for me true og is definitely like yeah an indica a nighttime because I'm already feeling down luckily I'm not gonna drive after this I'm just be chillin at the skate park right now for a couple hours go to and then after that just go to Target get some waters go home get ready for work tomorrow continue the grind that continuous grind guys actually have homework to do tonight so we're gonna be doing that also so grind it all the time so cheers boys this is for the people out there working hard every day to make [ __ ] happen I got the water man stay hydrated all the time I've really been taking health until like into more of like way bigger dude way bigger I've been enjoying it a lot more I've even thought about getting into bodybuilding because I've kind of been getting bored of just going and lifting weights just to look good you know I kind of want to challenge myself and do something so I might be getting into bodybuilding I'll see what the world like how hard it is because I already have a hard lifestyle as it is so but that would be pretty fun I mean I'm six foot one six foot two whatever I don't know double check that but six foot two I currently weigh 210 and I want to be honestly at a solid 190 so but just really lean muscle so we're almost there I've definitely definitely been seeing the results like coming in and it makes me happy no consistency is key guys so we're going to take this last hit and we're gonna finish the video because I'm already faded off my ass and then so cheers boys hi I'm not gonna let it go I'm gonna talk over it so I hope you guys enjoyed the video I hope you guys make sure to leave a like comment a sub don't forget to share with your friends do all that good jazz you know we keeping the positivity keeping the content coming the consistency every three days is kind of my schedule that I'm coming on right now which kind of works for me we got some big things coming up steezy big battery coming soon video moon rock coming video coming soon so imma ending here guys I'm faded I gotta go I hope you guys have an amazing day like I said again go make sure I hit that sub button if you're new here and have an amazing day lates", "0HlSWiWyFW4": "right today this video is on how to change a valve in a mixer tap so here's a mixer tap today we've got a basin mixer so the valve is underneath the handle just in here it's a regardless of whether it's a wall mixer sink mixer or Basin mixer like this one the valve is always just under the handle so the tools we'll need for today's valve swap two and a half millimeter allen key torque wrench or a shifting spanner sure you've got a towel handy right step one is to turn the water off now you can turn it off at the mains at the front of the house or turn it off underneath the base and if there's isolated taps under there next step is to release the pressure from the tap so we turn the handle on and release the pressure until there's no more water flowing out of the valve next step is to remove the handle so on this model we're going to unscrew the pin that in a safe place it doesn't damage anything fastening for the handle is down in this little hole here so we use our two and a half millimeter allen key insert it in there undo the grub screw until handles loose pull the handle off the top the next step is to remove this dome to cover here this is just a decorative cover over the top of the lock nut for the valve so remove that by hand anti clockwise to loosen remove that put it in a safe place then we left with this lock nut here so we're going to need to remove this to be able to get our valve out we use the spinner place it on hexes there and screw it it's loose you can use your hands too before we pull the valve out we're going to get our towel make sure we've got our towel handy I'm gonna pull the valve out there may be a few drips of water around here main either just dry it off now this is our old valve now we need to get our new valve so this lock that is loose on the top and remove that get our new valve so we've got two here place the lock nut back over the top now when we put this valve back into the tap we need to make sure we remember these little lugs here now those have got corresponding holes in the body of the tap and they come in to line up you drop it in Cowes them down once it's down through the lock nut back up by hand and just be careful as some of these threads on this lock nut can be sharp do it up and we tighten up the lock nut with our spinner or our torque wrench now if we've got a torque wrench we want to set the torque on eighth mutant meters once the lock nuts down tight enough make sure the valve is off so off there straight up with the stem turn the water back on and see that there's no leaks around this join line between the brass lock nut and the body of the tap if there are leaks we may need to tweak up the valve lock nut a little bit till the leg stops next stage if we just put out a dome cover straight back on so that goes on there thread it on the locknut straight down until it's tight handle back on tighten handle onto the stand move the valve pin back in now we want to just before we leave the site we want to just lift the handle just a little bit to release the air from in the lines out the tap before we turn it on to full pressure once all the air bubbles are out of the line we can lift it on to full pressure thank you", "JgbFegknsL0": "[Music] what is a simplistic here back with another video today I'm actually outside Blake's house and you already know the deal I usually like to do the video before we go into there because the Lighting's

that I'm pretty little ready we gotta go in there and smoke too so you know we can't really you know I'm saying but I just wanted to do a quick video with money because honestly you've seen him in the recent videos but oh yeah yeah that cartridge I sent you it didn't taste good at all I told them I got my idol yeah that [ __ ] was hot me like 97 like 93 or something oh my god but I said no bleep no

time to leave to play too late a piece [Music]", "OAfg-NwmiHM": "this is how the many pain comes comes in handy little team the legal cannabis or cannabis await the oil this is the Medi pen in fact the battery in the cartridge screw together so here is the cartridge the little rubber cap at the end there to protect the thread okay then we can help thee this is a battery anyway so then we plug the cartridge in there and you're all done ready to use it's designed for a way to deliver CBD and it's a nice way I like this way being a smoker and it's got flame slight flavor to this you can choose over twenty flavors or something it's pretty amazing this many pen delivers up in an AC easy way where if you are he's rechargeable this can be plugged into the charger here when you need to charge it screw that in and then there's a USB plug it in now charge now I've been using this for a while and I haven't heard the name charge it yeah it's all he's pretty good I've actually as you know some of you may know you know I'm vaping and nicotine been vaping for years when I have this even though there's no nicotine in this at all just CBD oil that how and obviously the flavor Spearman it slowed me down from using the normal vaping so if I've had a few puffs on this I don't feel like the needs of eight so this is doing something which is helping relax me and unstressed me that then means I don't feel like having the nicotine so that's a positive so it's pretty good it's about that for a few minutes and somehow it's just does its job it is a little bit not quite the image as I'm used on the vaping it's a little bit on the high side yeah he says mouth to lung so you know there's no taking this in knock on wood on a sub ohm vaping tank but you know it's good I'm glad I've got it he's having benefits in slowing me down on vaping I feel better after I've had this with the cannabis all drops eat then she'd be doing oil I'm getting a lot more in dosage I would have thought but I've decided to start taking mine at night it's like evening and I found that to be better than her I don't anything any side effects of whatever I'm gonna be having him asleep so I'm not having them

texting me about and but they've been asking me about this right here it's called red sky and of course you know it's a marijuana product weed whatever you want to call you but I'm not gonna lie to you guys I'm not really a big fan of vaping or you know anything of that nature I'm really just an old-school smoker you know give me a [ __ ] join or whatever not smoke it real quick this product like I have never seen like you see you see a help this is fancy you know like of course is here in Oklahoma that's why it has a little symbol right there it's pretty cute I like a cheap at all and this is the product that's in it that I will be reviewing this right here cost me about went a $50 honestly $50 you can get it for like 60 in some places if you find it for 50 then it's a deal if you get it for 45 and that's all those posts over so of course it has this little protective I don't know what you would call this but when you what you do just take it off course and with mine because you know some people do have the lien all this straight pin I wish I had it but this cost me $10 and I was like I'm not about to know you know I mean like smoke I can taste up to 99.99 of can of orders so it's very very high potent I will say that and that's what I like about these okay so the one main thing that I really really like about like making is the fact that you know when it comes to smoking like we bow or whatever you have this awful awful order and you just don't like it you know some people when you're walking down a store you can make a smell you they start judging you you know how people are whatever well with vaping this doesn't leave a big big big smelly they're down on again this is by Leafly it's kind of you know it's a little cheap I wish I had a different one but it's whatever so what I did is just put the little thing on there twist it on there pretty good and then you're gonna just stop it in there and this is just for the airflow and yeah let me just go ahead and take a rip and I'll let you guys know what I think and of course I already tried it honestly guys I mean I really really really enjoy it I'm not gonna lie to you guys that's one of the things about that I don't like about vaping it doesn't give me my like smoke cuz I'm used to smoking smoked smoked and this is just like a little smoke you know I'm saying of course you can hit it for a longer period of time hold it now you know for a longer time and the thing is like with these if you do that and you don't take the right hit bro like you're gonna be dying you're gonna be on the floor choking coughing your lungs out so it's really really important on how careful you are with these because of course it's not meant for everybody this is really really high ponen that's what I like I've been smoking for years and you're not smoking flour whatever it doesn't do it for me no more I need a little bit higher of concentration I'm [ __ ] it the only thing I do have a problem with the angle I cuz I told you guys that it's not the first time so yes so anyways so this is one thing that does kind of kind of rub me the wrong way but like when you bind these capsule even though they're like fifty sixty dollars you don't really use up all the product like this is an old one and I know it's a little dirty and all that has hair on it but you see how much it left over and like all this I could smoke I guess you could say but it just tastes so disgusting after you know being that like you still have a good amount but like it tastes nasty you know and so I had to just go

have a senior review for 2020 this year so I thought it might be the first one to do it so there it is so I have two honeycomb car cards cartridges and um yeah I spoke these a couple hours ago and these really didn't I thought hey you should probably review of these so let's start off with them the packaging right here so this is what the package looks like and as you can see this is its THC level and I think each of these cartridges had the same THC level eighty-three percent THC and 32 percent CBD and I would definitely recommend you to check out their Instagram they post um everything there and yeah I have indica zoo keys just do this one I'm just different flavors um sorry I want to say it Maui Wowi sativa and like I said same THC please follow their Instagram the show they always update their news and cartridges and yeah so let me just open them out right now as you can see these are definitely real folks this is the logo is so you can see right here pretty cool I'll show you the other one too well yeah same thing clear it's all real this is a fake [ __ ] and these have given me I have no problems at all with these and these are just really good I definitely recommend you all to buy these and you know mine might as well take a hit right now so I my pen right here there we go it's a little burned right here I think I am think I smoked outside one time and I brought outside I was on my jeans and the oil just was so thick there just froze and so I had to heat it up and I guess I made this that or I just burned it too much huh but ya gonna smoke this right now and let's see how this goes yeah just a giant nose to get Cheers yeah these are really good yeah how'd you smoke this like a couple minutes ago I'm not gonna smoke this but ya get the idea these are really good and um actually before I go like I said check their Instagram because they said something about their they're a half a gram cartridge how it will not have a a honeycomb logo on the top and they say after they're done with their half a gram cartridge is and them right they'll do the deed over one gram too so yeah definitely keep in mind in that this is um well should I just drop but um it's just my review and um yeah in conclusion I think these are really good and um these are like next to my favorite like um brass knuckles and um slime breath and yeah these are really good and I think you all would really enjoy it I think you should all give it a try and yeah thanks for thanks for watching this video if this helps you all um the next time you buy a cartridge and you take you have a good day", "it5uQ1w0M10": "hey guys it's the weed guy so I got my free samples come over the weekend at one of these little puppies cannabis events here in California right here in San Jose and this was always going to grab all the parts that came from out there i'm i buy some i get free samples a lot of people out there giving the free samples and all these here are black-market unlicensed brands pretty much besides cookies that belong to somebody well this is a black market cart packages but every time i go to one of these pop-up events i like to go do all of my stuff check them all out before i get to put on and what give them giving them away to friends it's just like going trick-or-treating and checking your candy before you eat them up so right here i believe this with a Sour Diesel let me see how it tastes oh yeah lawyer tastes like the tree so I'm gonna go ahead and pull out some of these here so let's check out this one I think here I got some like stickers somebody gave you oh yeah so I got some test results here from somebody by the name of cash Alan no Cali cartel you know some people out there they have the whole booth set up so I actually went and called this number that's on here then I asked them like hey I got some test results yada yada yada all day legit dizzy people send them in is this bogus or not and they're actually pretty legit so shout out to Kelly carts family whatever I got cash Evelyn's coming over man this is stickers from love sandwich snap Callie cart Callie 408 nice alright so let's go ahead and check out somebody's here let's do this chronic or what is this chronic 24k oh I like this one I had a seal that's a little scary freaky - can you mask with it looks good no crazy bubble movement here okay a woman that 24 K take a quick little rip on this one and see what it tastes like [Music] oh I got that a hint of flour taste that but taste what does it taste like 24 karat well I don't know what 24 karat gold tastes like but that's what it tastes like and I know why God so [ __ ] expensive that's pretty good so shout out to white mask people wherever they are let's check out let's check out this cookie so this one doesn't actually have any labels or there's actually even open let me cook your ground let's check out that oil oil is moving kind of you know moving a little bit quickly there well I tend to watch those I look a little bit quickly okay I'll still take a poke or the best way you're going to be able to tell is do the case if it tastes like [ __ ] like chemicals throw it away [Music] yeah [ __ ] is this lemon pound cake tastes like lemon Township hmm that one [ __ ] away that was a little funky let's check out this way so this one again has a little cilantro oh hey I'd rather have it hard to open well somebody does open it it'll look like that this one here is the Scotties oil duck fire nice golden color to it notnot super clear vitamin E licking ass [ __ ] let's check out biscotti from the white mask people oh yeah mmm I could actually taste a biscotti flour oh oh shout out to you white mask biscotti I got to get another hit of that one cuz that one was good [Music] mmm that's good no chemicals the taste is right on point don't got no chemical we taste to it don't got no like awkward tasters that cop is good there's no awkward like rough harsh coughing my throat let's check out this chocolate okay order doesn't look too bad actually have two chocolates here so I'll try to compare each one rule okay not too bad but I could taste like um it doesn't hmm booth is fine they didn't even put a local or anything on it so that one had like a awkward little taste to it I didn't get one inhale this [ __ ] I just had to spit it out so this here is another Sylvan with the white mouse yeah this is a chakra low best by date huh 12:23 2019 this is the best bike date on this 100 percent THC distillate solvent-free all organic all right we'll see if this charcoal oak taste any better than that chocolate [ __ ] over there two different people they came from two different stands one hat there's mark with their logo the other one in disguise oh yeah this one Tate you could actually taste so I get the hint of Bud in there and I can taste you know the chocolate I don't know if it says like a sweet chocolate maybe that coming from the catalog but that one hmm that tastes good and I'm trying not to inhale on all these guys too much because I do have to hit to work right after this moment about trying to belittle own so let's check out this white run there's two white runs again let's do a one on one so this is white run cheese see you supposed to be in these ninety two point two six percent T 18 in the white runs now I've actually bought white runs from the dispensary and I've also bought the white runs flower so we're definitely going to be able to compare no that doesn't even taste close to white room I can taste the flower in it a bit but it has this weird like aftertaste so nothing wrong I like these ones with the white scary crazy-looking Halloween house on it so this one the oils a little bit darker than that one from my experience the darker the more natural more lighter it is that means the more diluted it is which would explain why people are cutting the stuff with vitamin E oh yeah see this one tastes on point it's just crazy because they're the same [ __ ] packaging everything is the same on here these people mark the logo on it these people did it this one tastes like [ __ ] I wouldn't put my name on there either this one these white masters will stand by their Potter and I like that darker golden edge to it it's not as the same as all these other ones and that's the more natural effect this and again I'm gonna give me a more of a natural eye as a boat as opposed to like a euphoric synthetic hi I found some that we're at this dispensary right which I didn't even take their free samples they were super clear like almost like like a yellowish and to me those are the ones that we learned out here at the pop-up shows that are frowned upon because they're they're cut with so much synthetic THC cannaboids they're vitamin E people are cutting them in there with now like [Music] okay that for these peoples tastes pretty good okay not bad this have a logo a name no name well the way this pretty pebble taste is better than whoever made those other one so I'm assuming it came from another little person oh this one the white mask [Music] remember the more darker the more natural and I'm not talking about like a coffee Browns are building a smoker oh [Music] yeah this pretty pebbles way better I like these white mask people this stuff is on point I'm already starting to get a little buzz a little high and I like about these ones these white mass wood is as soon as I push it it's already starting to burn like I don't know if you guys can see it there but there's already smoke coming out there and right there so here closer look like that tells me that oil was nice and refined like good quality oil guys more ladies because it was a lady there that were that's a booth a good job like that's good oil if that takes forever to burn not no bueno [Music] really so this one doesn't even have a label nothing on it my experience from there no label tastes like [ __ ] besides the one that did it well I'm not gonna [ __ ] with it if it doesn't have this white mask label Oh [Music] so these white mass people is actually Cali snap shall we Cali cartel D 408 high society so these are the same people that game to the test results stickers I believe my buddy got a t-shirt chick didn't give me one though and they actually marked all their stuff with their logo and hey they stand behind it like let me take it away let me get a mother's I got a rip of this gorilla this is gorilla good look at nice darkest gold and not that yellow light yellow P looking stuff like don't do it those are vitamins in there listen lacking vitamins mmm-hmm okay you have that for being a card tricks for being concentrated THC you can you can taste the gorilla glue in here I actually have some gorilla glue flour sitting around and that's those fire let's check out this story oh no oh no logo again the weight doesn't look bad but if he doesn't have a logo like I'm not working with this at least these people who put the white mask on it I feel the problem with the product you know I can actually go and talk to them confront them about it because this is not the first time I've got I've gotten some from them and I've seen them at like these little pop-up shows you know they stand behind their product which is why they put the name on it these other people don't got to take the cap off oh that tastes that's gelato that's definitely gelato I love it these guys have these people have their stuff online that's quality ladies and gentlemen let's check out these smart quarters blueberry cookie is a hybrid lab tested organic so I already know all of these are black-market cartridges and the reason I say they're black market is because they're unlicensed brand for one reason or another they're not licensed in the state of California to sell in dispensaries but maybe one day they will because everybody started off that where we all started off doing stuff on the side eventually if we had enough then we grew into a legit business where we pay taxes Oh another white mask so this is blue cookie strain testing eighty five point three three percent total THC 0.18 percent total CBD 0.01 percent total CBN for medical use only California prop 215 compliant oh yeah so unless is brand or not these people have they have a top brand they have top quality local on their cartridge there's even a magnetic connection in there now I've seen these before and a buddy of mine knows with me and his girlfriend actually I grabbed the one from I guess there's white mask people and then they went to this other booth and grab some and they were just like regular corporate boxes like this super thin flimsy the oil was already bad that was a red flag for us when we looked at the oil it was the oil like this is like a nice golden and if you notice there's a difference from these chronic cartridges the quality of the oil to the smart card these are a more darker than these ones which from my understanding these cartridges here are heavy duty so I believe I have to have it on a four point a 4.0 and above in order to hit them because something about the mechanics of it it's the lawyer has to be finer it has to be more thin in order for it to get to my screwed a rib so because these people with the might white mask Kelly car Kelly because I see if they're brands different colors of oils that tells me there was a different process of making this one to this one which is good [ __ ] the people would have all these different packs all these different boxes of different flavors but all the oils look the same red flag don't do it it's probably vitamin E in synthetic THC so let's check out this one this one the blue cookies I like that and that coffees like a clean cop it's not no harsh it's not a little harder scoff we're like my lungs hurt and forget those are my chest is any poison to come out of my chest it's good [ __ ] another cali cartel anyone what the [ __ ] is your name snap cali cartel you far away Oh snapchat cali cartel you far away got it well I'm already getting [ __ ] hungry so I'm gonna go grab me some in and out for chick-fil-a let's check out this one high potency triple x OG indica nice it has a nice little 3d print on here okay well like I said I've learned not to judge by the packaging everybody buys the same packaging from China off of Alibaba or DHgate Calm it's what's inside there so colors say a lot but it's that quick test so let's see [Music] well I like that's good [ __ ] okay that's good [ __ ] I'm actually gonna keep this one on my pen to finish so I'm gonna head on out guys I got to grab me some lunch with another 20 about 7:00 a.m. some reason I'm starving I'm gonna go they're keeping all the woods with the white mask there is no white mask just means to run away because I wouldn't give it to a friend I wouldn't smoke it myself yeah I'm not here we're here to get high high society [ __ ] I'm not killing each other walking on the lip oh those are words either way that away those away that away this is the one that came with some nasty taste booth is this some weird do so keep going those are going oh no I don't see a white mask on me throwing that away all right so I'm keeping those throwing those away um check out checking out on my next review i'll be posting up a few things when I go to these pop-up shows they ask that we don't record while we're there so I won't be doing that but I'll show you guys what I have come would I get coming back and now there was a lot of a lot of other new ones there a lot of ones that around a palm on the black arm on the black market and in these clubs and these little pop-up shows like Mario karts kikyo's brass knuckles what else is there exotic cars there's a lot of ones that I'm like that I have a bad reputation gain although I've done some good ganks and I believe that's when I got on was from these people this is about maybe two to three years ago the white Cali cartel II and their dates will fire but for some reason they're not making them anymore wouldn't well those are bad there's so many other ones that are coming out there now remember if it if that oil it's not like a golden the light of look at it this is the light of the oil is the more processed it has been visualized this is why imagine this if you put a scoop of coolant a cup a scoop of powdered kool-aid inside of a cup the more water you add the more diluted it gets right it's the same thing with oils so don't think you're getting a good deal don't risk your life over saving a few bucks on buying some stuff that have that's been filled with synthetic THC and vitamin E it's not worth the ladies and gentlemen high society about getting high it's what we just enjoy ourselves the one that's our pastime for whatever reason don't buy from them if you know anybody like I said check out these people a snap Cali cartel your way I know a few other people who have got fire product it's good but just for the examples I have here these damn people supply provided test results which I've actually called the company and asked about it they verified it they got stickers t-shirts what else did they have they had a bunch of stuff they even had a flower there they were giving out a bunch of samples a lot of these people were selling their samples for you know ten bucks these people with the white mask were giving away their samples like and of everybody there and these 50 cent at little pop and he's 50 little stands everybody was selling this stuff some type of profit these white mask people had like two females there and a guy and they were giving away their product so that tells me a lot about the character of whoever is making these so thumbs up guys and if you like continue to follow share the story on this raise awareness do not kill yourself to save a few bucks don't smoke stuff that's unlabeled you don't really know where it's coming from if people are saying they're getting it from you know a family member who owns a dispensary in a whole other state they're lying simple as that any of these that you see here you will not find in a dispensary anything you see on Instagram where people are talking about I have this I have that look it up in the dispensary if it's not there it's a black-market cartridge and don't buy from them because they weren't straight up with you from the gate and they tried to scan so stay tuned I'll get back this guy's deck next time I'm freaking hungry and I'm gonna take my I think this was rose OG with me or

only seemed to irritate your understanding is not required only your obedience beyond your way sir this time when the night to have leave the world beyond the door seem more sorry about that beyond chapter the winds of winter god I love me some george RR martin another thing I like is liked about that we put some light on this okay and he's heard blood that be light and there was and it was good so how you guys doing how you been what you doing huh long time no see ah that's quite been there since yesterday well as you can see we've had a change of venue that's a sore subject so I'm not really gonna get into that right now well what I am gonna get into is a review of these new pens that I've been trying to know that are freaking amazing hold on a second I'll show you what I'm talking about now I have chance to grab a hold of some [Music] Mario Kart pens these are all-natural lab tested no PG nope EEG no VG I guess it's like vegetable oil on other things that give you like popcorn long stuff like that no contaminants or pesticides detected in compliance with prop 215 section below do not drive or operate heavy equipment keep out of the reach of children unlawful to redistribute alright so as you see we have three different flavors well they're not really flavors these actually what I love about these bins is they're strange specific these are not flavors added to it it just uses a really cool picture to advertise the actual strength so for the fire oh gee you can see here there is Bowser yeah Bowser right I believe it's Bowser yeah Bowser sorry it's been a while so I played Mario and this I mean they'd say Mario karts but obviously this is Donkey Kong if you can see that is that brain you see it here my mother did is it I don't know I'm kind of curious about I know it's like gorilla glue like the actually like this like this yeah I didn't still in the garage in case you were wondering it's just a really fancy garage yeah so on the gorilla glue kind of curious on what that substance is there that he's squishing is a really gorilla glue or is it go real like a loop you know um as I am and finally we have Weaver huh weird he went on the wheat we already did this one sorry and finally we have Wario and he is the brand in case you cannot read that cookies the breed should I say cookies so we have fire og as Bowser to get [ __ ] up on that one gorilla glue as Donkey Kong a gorilla fitting and wah do his cookies which happenstance gorilla glue and cookies are hybrids and fire oh gee is it indica yeah so let's get the show on the road we are starting with the fire og takes your wondering what kind of battery I'm using is an eye stick power I've had it for like two years and this thing is freakin amazing I mean I'm in a wheelchair I dropped this thing almost on a daily basis I've ran it over with my wheelchair like twice and this [ __ ] is still [ __ ] kicking oh and you can run it way down and use these small refillable the refill pins and you'll lock you lock it right cuz I've learned to hear these up on accident then I got like figure out I'm going to use a syringe like draw the little I'll put it another one that's still working so if you do get one of these make sure you lock it on like three to five dip it in our pop pop you like your quill but that's what's three point three watts is what I got and that's to get a good flavor and what I'll do is I'll turn it up to like a 3c I got a lot I got unlucky then over it up to like 3 8 or 3 9 relock it cuz you don't wanna burn the coil up especially when you got money invested in the oil that's in there and need the medicine hmm yeah you get a lot more oh yeah that's a good stuff I'll always have loved fire oh gee though and this really does taste like the breed um this is probably good you see how much I've been swimming around it's probably gonna be one of my favorites oh yeah bookshelf I like to keep like memorabilia and stuff some knives for grandpas to supply that look at this freakin bowie knife right here I just inherited sadly lost the grandfather recently and almost had a little breakdown but we're doing good now my grandma gave me this I have a matching one from my grandfather k-bar I had a handle I don't know to match this one so it's like a matching samurai said you know like but it's an American bowie knife and k-bar right doesn't get much better than that right you want a bar lover quick story then each point is that each one of these were the possessions of each of my grandfather's that one was my grandfather the cowboy and moonshiner and general alcohol you know to the day died you mean when he was not long I took home the CB handle outlaw you know imitating him and learning from him this is an actual Vietnam issue K bar that was used by marine in the field and I took it to a knife maker recently say knife maker that did that and uh this one I need to polish it up though it's a it's been sitting out in the shelf since got brass is corroded you know and then he had possibly it again this was blackened or gluten steel you know gun blued steel so it was black so he had to polish this thing for hours to get it any kind of shine out of it at all just good my grandpa had you know God blue did so many so many times over the years to keep it from rusting um sadly I've lost both my grandparents but I have these two minutes to remember them by into your mortal lies my thoughts on them sitting on my bookshelf playa visualize them and see them remember them every day that's the way they should be if you leave this world and people don't remember you then you didn't make an impact so I feel like by not remembering my campus or memorializing them on our bookshelves we we are forgetting them and leaving them in the past yeah I'm getting a little motion let's go back to the testing ah gorilla glue this was for you grandpa the general outlaw and the moonshiner yeah I tell you a funny story yeah I was like 10 to 12 years old you know almost old enough to know better we were in the hug Club and we would go down to the woods even that come on with me grandson we're gonna go water some tomato plants I always was wondering like what the hell are these tomato plants doing way the hell out in the woods away from the damn farm you know like away from the farm the farm house and not even really on our property just property where our cows were allowed to graze just think it was a state land actually he's dead now so you know who cares I'm confessing to a crime that I committed when I was a teenager and had no idea that it was even a crime until I was thirty right okay so long story short or water in these these these tomato plants and after about six months you know I asked my grandpa why don't these tomato plants ever produce any tomatoes and what the [ __ ] are those things on top of them and then he he told me the gig but he didn't tell me the gig but I don't really remember what he told me I'm just no subverted he probably wouldn't think he probably took me his store bought me ice cream like subverted my brain waited from that right good job grandpa because it took me a long time to figure it out I love you but uh you know he he was a man beyond his years and in thoughts and ideas and the way people you know that's why it became a bootlegger because he thought that it was wrong that they took this thing away from us that we had so all of our lives it was like air or water you know you can't take alcohol away from somebody when it's so readily available we can't take a plant from the way so money but it's so readily available all over the planet you can grow it anywhere you could make alcohol anywhere you can you know it's not like they they couldn't stop alcohol during Prohibition and they're not going to stop marijuana in the modern time if if they think they can they're stupid and if you think that they can you're stupid because the clear evidence of all the thirteen seventeen states or whatever that of Divac be either decriminalized are completely legalized in three states that have made it recreational it is what we cannot have a country divided on the subject this is one thing that I think all Americans can stand together very easily and you know what it's really hard to think about war and all that when you're then a peace circle pass it around enjoy we pass around a peace pipe that's all I'm gonna say that's what I'm gonna end this on so do yourself a favor go sit down in a circle with your friends pass around a joint or a peace pipe and spread the love right because that's what we need to do to to get these laws enacted reacted changed whatever we want you know like to get the legalization of the recreational usage and the you know people who should have the right to use it with for religious purposes I'll completely empathize with the Rastafarians in every state in our country who cannot consume the like holy vessel of their church legally that is insane to me it's just a plan it's just the plan you know we need more more knowledge and forethought in this world our what is possible what we should imprison our people for and I wish a [ __ ] would tell me with my paralyzed self double amputees that I'm breaking the law this is my medication just as much as all of this all of this the doctors want you to take that crap shove it down your throat every goddamn day but then wouldn't you pop for a piss test they want to jump all over you and make you go to [ __ ] drug court or something you know it's insane what without world is coming to what a person in a wheelchair I'm just gonna right now what an individual paralyzed double an TT should not have to jump through hoops and and be treated like like a drug seeker or or a junkie would they go to doctors for help and that's the truth that's my experience", "QiE3bvVQO8o": "quick introductory video instructional video on how to use the leak proof cartridges now this is actually a cartridge that i've used already so i apologize about that but i have placed it back in the original starting position so first thing that you want to notice in any cartridge if it's not hitting it usually means there's a space right on the bottom here that means there's a space here but the leak-proof portion has not been activated we pull the top off when we're ready to use it now avoiding touching this sorry avoiding touching this blue rubber stopper here because we don't want to pull that off unless with that tamper with it we want to grab the top classic portion here and notice this part here I'm going to press down and turn okay and I can pull it back up for you so you can see the movement there we go so again now touching the blue thing not pulling it out you're going to grab the top and a press you're going to turn as soon as you do that in about 10 seconds the product is gonna be ready to use grab the tip click it back on give it 10 seconds or so and go ahead and use it", "M_XMAEFgQ7o": "good okay so I bent this little deal the little piece of metal sheet of metal into this U shape so it fits right into this groove the purpose for this is for it to go and cover the bottom edge and stick out a little bit because this deal when it closes as you can see the edge of the joy stick or whatever this is called when it moves all the way in it practically disappears and there's nothing to push on this with it hides inside that's just what is it called grease or whatever it is yes so what happens is this little deal right here is supposed to be just enough for it to grab on to it to push this thing all the way in to close the water and when it breaks it doesn't do that so I'm just giving it a little more edge here to grab on to and like I said I already tried this and it worked so I wanted to share it with you so now I stuck it back in actually completely throw this out there is no reason for it other than for it to fail so now I'm going to put it back in I got it put it back and momentum drama tight-knit now I'm not saying that this is going to last us years but it's going to last us just enough until I have some time to go to the hardware store and buy the replacement because today it completely quick closing the water and I couldn't get it to turn off ok so waters off it's on work off you're welcome", "lYo-h_ya0mI": "Giovanni I'm gonna be a pretender for the day and today we're gonna be talking about vape pens simply basically we're gonna hit up on our French harmony which I've glasses some about the best product into their cartridge Thank You harmony but also too so you understand the setup the basic part would be the battery being the top part either button or just pull but we prefer the button it will come with a charger for it USB always that'll be the basic setup for that but cartridges here so we are having this laser beam green crack and the Gupta these are some of my favorite notch because of the product but the case itself is nice you get a nice good clear glass that you can see through but also at the top basically we have this kind of carb cap that you can open up to allow more oxygen to

"what's up youtubers I thought images back with another review this one is Church cannabis company super premium cannabis distill it adjustable airflow cartridge advanced ceramic coil 510 threads 8 watt max ultimate vaping experience stated 7/16 2019 so that's just for the sale though THC says 70.2 and all the other all the other numbers are pretty pretty faded definitely looks like the kid I bought it from has already opened it it's got push-button just by the slide so he told me when he sold it to me that there's a good chance that this isn't gonna fit my palm and stuff like that judging by the feel and look and everything of it upfront yeah it's not gonna fit is just the circumference of it it's just way bigger mouthpieces that's a plaque heart compared to one of these church hearts right here is the adjustable airflow there's three circles yeah three own I wasn't sure if there's more than it for a second three of them on both sides so you can have all of them you know wide open or you know I guess it's just depending on how you enjoy smoking and stuff all right bomb battery no way that's that's not fit I'm glad he told me so I was able to pre charge a different battery we're just gonna go max airflow I would say that's almost like the N taste of like taking a sip out of like a McDonald's strawberry shake make that little aftertaste I would say that's what you're getting and flavor-wise out for this one so definitely a smooth hit taste real good presentation on the box to the card I would say is really good but it's why it costs more I think there's I think I spent 50 bucks I think I've also seen places on it upwards $60 yeah as I said it's got a lot of weight to it Oh that was Church Strawberry Cough if you have the money and you want to try it and your local just

said I'm still working on just getting his stuff better tried to flip my camera sideways and do a different review but I couldn't figure out where stared so my eyes were just looking to the left constantly so I decided to switch up the product and do the review on this one instead I have a tiny little bit of wax I can do a review on from flight club extracts cookies cush I also have a tarantula I know nothing about it there's no sticker no packaging so it's probably just a house house blend I think you said house of dank I don't know and then I also have a platinum vape hybrid that

Partridge with you I hope you come back and join me next time until then have an awesome day [Music]", "TMteMpw4YCY": "what's good YouTube today guys 1-1 like alright before I get into this video I just want to say I drove literally over like I think close to an hour to go to verified spot where I could get this and I'm gonna go ahead and put that spot right here so you guys can to see like that it's legit so as you guys know heavy hitters right here it has a reputation it's been getting a really bad reputation because there's been a lot of counterfeits a lot of fakes and then you know a lot of bunk [ __ ] going around was like these these things have been sold on eBay the cartridges in the packaging for like five cents and you know people have been filling them with hot dog water man and then they used to be one of my favorite cartridges so you guys go back in my reviews I used to reviewed like five different ones of these and they were so amazing I remember everything all the time smoking them I'm just like do this this is the most enjoyable moment of my day you know so mmm let's get let's get straight into this man heavy hitters purple punch I'm sure you guys a close up I haven't opened it this is a brand new brand new packaging this is my first time getting a heavy hitters in over a year at least a real one so let's go get into here you see the heavy hitters purple punch alright let's go ahead and look at that oil man app that bubbles not gonna move that's huh that's one way that you know you'd see nope it's not moving Bo and this is the new packaging has the heavy hitters down there push to release purple punch it has the THC percentage cannabinoids all that good stuff and then so it says push to release and then I'm guessing you just pull okay no apparently not let's see push to release how hard do you have to push man I'm literally better break it doesn't want to come out it's probably cause of this sticker though let me give me one second guys so push to release right here and then boom you get out the packaging heavy-hitters is very very nice holographic super clean man get out of the packaging boom look at that beautiful oil dude wow this is what a real heavy hitters is supposed to look like none of that bunk ass [ __ ] moving as soon as you flip it upside down so get rid of that I'm not sure if a sticker supposed to come in here or not but I'm guessing not so get rid of that here's a packaging and then like that still hasn't moved still hasn't moved look at that amazing boy so back to the video main when you go ahead and drink some water shout out to hydro class keeping my water cold at all times you gotta stay hydrated it doesn't matter what what time of the day it is doesn't matter what are you smoking up you gotta stay high you're so heavy hitters I'm excited man whoa alright so I missed these tip I honestly like the tips these cartridges have to be one of my favorite ones they just look so clean man whoo I mean I don't even yeah I'm like a purple like a great kind of so first we're tried on the ooze battery man hopefully this thing works last time I tried trying on the Gras garden didn't work so sitting nice and flush these cartridges always stay nice and flush tell your truth that's why they have on the poems problems because some of the batteries they don't have these little openings right here to let the air go through so you have to keep it kind of loose but with this one it does have the hole so you don't have to worry about that so 3.3 volts and then let's see man let's see your cheers boy so you guys are 18 and over 21 and over y'all know the deal man Mich you guys are smoking along with me y'all all that good stuff let me know what you guys are smoking on if you guys ever tried a real heavy hitters let me know what your experiences it was with like what flavor did you like what flavor didn't you like and et Cie so yeah choose guys yeah right off the bat it has that og heavy hitters taste dude has that taste that like it tastes like piney and that's the signature of the heavy hitters in my opinion you know that little piney tastes like it tastes so nice and so like earthy and that's what I like tasting about this like the one other strain I think it's at the Northern Lights oh my gosh amazing dude this purple punch though so far I'm getting a very very hint of the purple punch like if he has ever smoked purple punch who whether it be from my the purple punches that I have some up from his jungle boys loud pack and bear farms so all dude purple punch is just like one of those flavors that's going around in a super popular but not a lot of people can perfect it you know they put fillings in it like when making consec concentrates especially they put feelings that make it taste like like you know like kool-aid stuff like that for example astiz II I'm not bashing on Suzi there are purple punch is amazing but it tastes too much like candy doesn't taste like you know wheat it doesn't taste like that good good man this punch this tastes exactly like they got a purple punch flower you know just squished it put some mother did their disel it and then mix it in with the distillate and then boom in a cartridge that's it it's very nice the cold filtered just I love the cold filtered on these man so like I said like I took two three hits and the oil still not moving there's still no oil no bubbles going up man this is definitely I'm happy I caught this man I'm happy like I went drove an hour away to get this man so off with the ooze battery we're gonna try it on the bat mod the one you don't really these are just pull and then screw it on slap it on there it looks pretty nice I just don't like that these are like super wobbly so yeah cheers guys so not too much power you get you get a lot of flavor not too much clouds I'm still don't I still don't get a hype and this is this is tested at 90 percent total cannabinoids so I mean I don't know though we we have to check that the website I might have to check at the website out after the video until you as if it's legit or not you know cuz heavy hitters lot also they had I think they had pesticide fails I'm not too sure about that I mean I was gonna use the bat mock but to heat up the oil but it looks like the oil is doing pretty good still no air bubbles so don't need it you guys didn't know this is the one that you put the little tubing around and it moves the wax on top so yeah put this back on the O's and then we're gonna take some hits off of 3.5 setting and then see what those are 3.6 get some heavy hitters in there alright so cheers guys I'm gonna do five to seven second pulls on this you would just just get try to get nice and baked so yeah it's pretty good for the most part I'm getting like some pretty decent hits off of this and the oil still you know just chilling dude still hasn't moved that's what I like to see it is moving a little slightly ever so slightly though and that's what you want out of a cartridge man I'm getting the the mellowness I'm getting everything it's a very very mellow it's not very too like strong in your face and that's kind of one thing that I've noticed about purple punches like when people make the Pens like I've never had a purple punch that hits me in my face you know it's always channel like subtle very mellow and this is it you know heavy hitters brings you just that but I feel like they for sure have I don't know I don't know if I can say they have the best purple punch but it is definitely talked to I would have to go back and see what concentrated cards have the purple punch like for example raw garden is killing it if you guys haven't seen my last video go check that out this one right here is the berry punch and it's amazing dude I got this one the raw garden so amazing this these guys perfect every single cartridge ever like their their cartridge like I mean I know I don't want to bring it in while I'm reviewing it disel it this is a refined light resident but you know the purple punch on these are amazing so get back to the review man we're gonna take one last rip and finish it out for you guys and then this is going up on Monday by the way so I hope you guys have an amazing week you know go follow me on instagram at back without if you guys enjoy the video so far if you guys are new here go ahead and hit that like comment and subscribe button so cheers guys yeah whoo it's a bit it's very very smooth dude that's one thing that I can say about it very smooth if he like I could probably take like 20 hits of this no problem it doesn't really have me coughing that much as like the raw garden usually does the raw garden has me freaking dying after I hold in for two seconds and but yeah it's a very nice I'm getting the very eyes are going down my head is probably starting it's starting to think freely and I'm just chilling you know that's kind of what you want out of a pen I already see I had to take a lot of hits to get there I mean I see they lower air bubble on top just kind of um opening up a lot more and that's probably just because the wick is getting waked up and but yeah man it's not bad it's definitely a comfort of the price that I got it for it's nice like I said I'm gonna put the dispensary right here and on the in the description below if you guys ever in the area and want to go check them out they have two amazing prices so yeah one last hit for you guys are for the boys for the boys and hold it how very very smooth like I said yes so overall heavy hitters um what I buy it again probably not and the only reason why I wouldn't buy it again is because heavy hitters were back in the time you know they were great they had their they had the competition on lockdown they had they were beating everybody that's just because there were so many people doing this you know doing this game and then now that there are so many other people's like you know like these raw guard and I'm I know I talk about them so much but they're just a perfect example because they bring for the perfect price in the perfect product into the table and then you know like heavy hitters you can either get it at a very low price like I did or get it at a very high price and that's kind of what a lot of people are doing right now because they're sort of scarce like around there is and it just sucks but yeah I definitely wouldn't cop this again you can easily get something better for equal price and yeah but unless you want to try something original something that's been around for some time you know you know like if you're new to the to the scene and you want to try something that's been around for a while I recommend definitely recommend going for these you know to get a get a taste of what people in five years ago we're tasting the four years ago or tasting you know and yeah it's pretty it's good it's a good smoke overall though I'm not gonna lie just my tolerance I'd I wouldn't want to buy it in so yeah heavy hitters eight out of ten I would say you know the high is a good 7.5 the taste is amazing I would eight point five and then you know the Terps they were there they were there there but like I said heavy hitters isn't very chirpy chirp central but yeah overall that's a good quality project I would buy it I wouldn't buy it again though you know we're just rambling at this point so I'm gonna go ahead and end the video here if you guys enjoyed the video like I said they would like comment and subscribe button we'll catch you guys later", "Ob7UmDr_ty4":

"well welcome back for our little plumbing Shop of Horrors today we have an opportunity to see whether or not we can salvage what was a very nice moderately high-priced faucet or if this is something we're just going to scavenge and throw in the junk pile this was a leaking problem that the client just decided to go ahead and replace the philosopy now let's just take a look at this thing just a moment for a couple of signs first of all you see this accumulation right there buildup of hard water that's an indication of a longtime leak that's coming from underneath this spout portion here now another telltale sign that somebody's worked on this thing before is see how this little compression knot here has been deformed so somebody crank down on this thing pretty hard to try and stop this leaking and deformed this little piece here but let's take this thing apart a little bit and just see if we can tell anything more about what's going on I've loosened the set screw holding the handle and there's nothing that immediately jumps out with this here I've also already loosened this little collar here that we saw was deformed I don't think that there's any gaskets or anything missing from here this all looks pretty intact and next we're going to pull off this entire piece here and take a look at the gaskets underneath now the first thing that may not be too obvious until we really take a closer look is we do have some accumulation of hard water stuff here that's that's only natural that gets under there but what concerns me is this gasket right here there are two gaskets here one on the top and one on the bottom and if you notice the one on the bottom still looks pretty good it's nice and supple the one up on top is not so much so and it's actually a little bit different shape I'm going to pull this off so we can get a closer look at it now one of the problems of doing gasket replacements on these is that each model of faucet has its own gaskets and they need to be a very specific shape and thickness and this one looks like it is just a little bit smaller than the one down at the bottom although the groove that it goes in is about the same size this one is also a little bit flat which you can't see very well whereas the other one is nice and round and it may be that this is the wrong size gasket that perhaps in a previous fix somebody tried to replace that gasket and use this one that isn't quite right let's take a look at something else here that is indicative of our problem if you see that little rough spot right there that's also mineral deposits which means that water is leaking around that gasket and it creates just a little roughness in there so that the water can seep around that under pressure now the other thing that happens is that as the spout and and besar turn that creates kind of a sandpaper effect in there it eventually scratches the inside of that cylinder and when that happens that makes a gap that's much harder to seal and at a certain point it makes the thing unusable I took the bottom you asked it off as well and it appears to be the same size in the same shape as the upper gasket which is on the left so the gasket appears to be the the right size or should be the right size so it's a little bit of a mystery as to why this is is leaking around sometimes the leaking just starts when the faucet sits for a long time this faucet came from a house that had sat empty for for many many months and that is very hard on the gaskets and seals of plumbing parts sometimes you just get lucky and if you use some descaling things just like you'd use in your your bathroom to clean your bathtub of the calcium buildup we're going to use that on these internal parts both this and the this is the spout and see if that doesn't clean it up enough to stop the leaking so we've descaled our cartridge assembly here all nice and clean took my gasket up to the hardware store and bought a couple of brand new gaskets and we cleaned out all the scaling inside and pretty well on the outside of the housing as well so the only thing to do now is to put it back together and see whether or not we got a winner so hooked up to our makeshift water supply source let's give this thing a test and see how we did don't see any leaking here back and forth from hot to cold so I'd say we pretty successfully salvaged a reasonably expensive piece of kitchen faucet REE now this may not be very cost-effective to have your plumber do but as you can see relatively simple tools relatively simple procedure saved a very expensive faucet", "Uj_9Yv_cKFk": "hello Senor stoner fans and welcome to another chapter of senior stoner studio reviews what I want to talk about today is something that is very important for senior

have out here as examples have no push button you will draw automatically when you suck the light will go on in the bottom and you will get heat that will have an effect of vaporization on the liquid inside the top cap you see you have a cartridge in each one of these that has material in it the material that's inside is usually distill it a version of distill it you don't get to control how you're making it but you can pick your own flavors for example here's a Flav rx black label here is a boom farms highlighter of reserve and this flavor will be Tahoe OG Kush this one is blueberry indica here's another one that has a totally different flavor and here is a ruby cartridge that is a skittles flavor this one is made by candy pens and his skittles you can actually have them flavored in that design there this is a ruby by candy pens which takes a cartridge that looks very different it takes a cartridge that is proprietary for the Ruby design there are some other pens on the market like this that are very discreet very small and all you have to do with these pens to get them to work this stick the cartridge right inside the battery and it's ready to go these tests out around the same in terms of their actual content so what you're going to be able to do on most cartridges is read how much THC is inside of them they should have between 67 and 95 percent THC obviously the more THC the more effect they're going to have you can get also CBD for vape cartridges if you're interested in those these are by far the easiest way to get it into your body and you can control it a lot better than an edible where if you're not experienced it might be a problem this allows you literally to take one or two hits at a time and see what it does and move on from there there's a lot of great varieties out there for cartridges don't worry if the cartridge is generic some dispensaries make their own what you're looking for is the flavor that you want and the effect that you want whether you want to overcome insomnia have your appetite back take pain away whatever anxiety away whatever it would be you can really dial it in well with these types of products also one thing of note the kind pen company makes a battery that I have now bought several times and I find it to really work well with vape cartridges so you might want to check them out I recommend their batteries they have colors to choose from and they're nice in the customer service as well lastly I'm gonna go back to an item I talked about already called the Ruby this is a cartridge pen not a vape pen per se and you can actually fill them ourselves so I recommend taking a look at the Ruby for all those who are interested in something that's a no-brainer put it in your purse put it in your pocket they don't leak take it with you very little charging time and they can go all day I hope you enjoyed the studio review of battery operated vape pens that use cartridges have a great day senior stoner", "33tAoqyMQcg": "yo what up YouTube Jessie California California smokin Channel we got a special review here on the open vape 2.0 that's right yes sir it's the open vape 2.0 that's the one that I personally use myself right here in fact hold on hold on let's just take a second everyone light them up in honor of my [ __ ] video alright so let's get into the business so why why is this the vape that I use well because it's the [ __ ] best it's the [ __ ] best why is it the [ __ ] best it's just the [ __ ] best so how do you use it well this the stylus part down here is a button so we got one two three four five BAM that turns it on you saw that when it turned on it was an orange light now that orange light indicates that it is in orange mode what the [ __ ] is orange mode what the [ __ ] is orange mode well I'll tell you what orange mode is orange mode is it's a mild and balanced medium that's right mild and bounce medium [ __ ] it's a three point two voltage alright now when are you gonna be using orange well you can use orange remember the [ __ ] you feel like it but I I usually use smooth and mellow because I'm just a smooth [ __ ] so how do you get to smooth and mellow I want to be on smooth and mellow I'm feeling smooth and mellow so we go one two now it's on green that's high when you got one [ __ ] hit and you need to make a count you've got thirty seconds this is the [ __ ] setting for you my friend because you want to [ __ ] get your money's worth it does kind of burn it it'll burn the wick even if you have a metal cartridge if you hit it hard it's gonna burn it so I usually stay away from it but again if you need to make it [ __ ] count you need to be on the [ __ ] green now let's go another two one two blue it looks purple but that's really blue one to blue what is that that's the wax well I don't recommend using wax on these batteries that's just my [ __ ] opinion all right what do I know I'm just a [ __ ] I'm just [ __ ] Jessie California with the [ __ ] do I know right anyway don't use [ __ ] wax on these batteries you want to [ __ ] smoke wax get yourself a battery with the [ __ ] button all right get yourself a big [ __ ] battery these little skinny ones this is not for [ __ ] wax these are for cartridges all right one two purple that's my favorite I usually stay at purple two point four volts so yeah two point four compared to four I mean that's [ __ ] that's a big difference I mean I'm not a known [ __ ] math major but I'm feeling like that's a pretty [ __ ] big difference so what does that mean for me well it means that my battery lasts a lot longer means that my cartridge lasts a lot longer means that my wick doesn't burn does the high change yeah the high change is a little bit you change the temperature the high is gonna change isn't noticeable only if you're a [ __ ] genius I don't really notice too much so I stay on low my [ __ ] oil lasts longer it tastes [ __ ] better everything is just [ __ ] better so what else can this battery do we got the one two three four five that turns it on and off we got the one to click that changes settings what about three we go one two three and it goes through the different lights and it it ended on green so let's do it again one two three starts on red then goes orange yellow and then green so what is that that's a battery indicator that's right it [ __ ] lets you know how much juice you got left so you're not just gonna be walking down the street having a great day and have your [ __ ] battery died and and then yeah so battery indicator it's got different [ __ ] temperatures and you get all these pretty colors it comes in this it comes in blue it comes in that ugly [ __ ] orange that I bought that was a mistake comes in this green this green is [ __ ] it's really [ __ ] nice it comes in a lot of different colors you can get this at open vapes website they are normally 50 bucks yeah they're [ __ ] expensive but you know what they go on sale all the time Memorial Day for 20 [ __ ] I don't know you name it they go on [ __ ] sale all the time what happens when they go on sale well a couple different things can happen one sometimes they have a buy one get one free or like a half off basically and sometimes they have a 30% off and yeah comes with a warranty I've never had to use the warranty I've never had one go bad on me one thing I will say one thing I will say about these is uh if you like to vape in bed don't [ __ ] roll over on it I think you don't [ __ ] roll over on the [ __ ] thing because right here where this chrome meets the blue it's not supposed to separate there but with the cartridge you think about it it's got this cartridge out right here so if you roll over it it's got a lot of [ __ ] pressure right there and then the [ __ ] middle and what happens is that part sort of separates and there's a couple little wires in there now if you're lucky and you separated and you notice you roll over and it pops in your life [ __ ] and you [ __ ] save it sometimes you can pop the metal back in as long as those wires don't break now if you're a [ __ ] if you got a soldering iron and all that [ __ ] [ __ ] and you got all that [ __ ] time to waste no big deal but if you don't don't roll over on it cuz it'll break it will [ __ ] break that's the [ __ ] open vape 2.0 pick one up wait till they go on sale I have to I have to because you never know when one might go out well that reminds me it does have this so has this little USB charger and this thing is badass it actually has another feature that I'm gonna show you all right [ __ ] now it has a quick charge so how often are you about to go out and you're like god dammit god dammit I gotta wait [ __ ] twenty minutes from my [ __ ] battery to charge well no sir not not this one so you plug it in right and then it's got a touch sensor so the light is orange now and yeah you saw it turn red back to orange red orange right so red is a quick charge that's right and it charges quick as a [ __ ] I mean a couple minutes and you're pretty much good to go you're good to go open vent open vague to point up good to go [ __ ] and I'm out", "Vfss29-GGzQ": "YouTube what

him and said that mine no proof that I even own the thing and they overnighted this to me for free it's nice yeah we might as well disassemble the old one volume control stuff sort of glued together

Well, it's really fascinating! In this video, you are going to be taken behind\nthe scenes and introduced to the Science of Vaping. First, we have to look at the simple notion\nof \"heating\" And that is Conduction vs. Convection. These are the two main ways a vaporizer will\nheat your oils and dry herbs. You would have been taught this in high school. But for some of us, that was a long time ago\nright? So let's recap! Firstly, what is the difference between the\ntwo? Conduction transfers the heat of energy through\ndirect contact. Just like a kettle on a hot stove. Convection is movement of hot air in and around\nthe desired material. Think of how your blow dry works. Now, different vaporizers use different methods... So it's worth knowing which does what and\nwhat you would prefer. So le'ts now use the Pros and Cons of Convection\nand Conduction. Since Conduction was the first method used\nin vapes... They are generally inexpensive compared to\ntheir counter parts and usually heat up faster. Hoever, the vast consensus is conduction vaporizers\nare less efficient. This is because any material heated through\nconduction will be unevenly vaped. It requires you to stir or shake in between\ndraws to reduce the risk of combustion. Convection is a better option. The only CON's with convection heating devices\nis the initial expense and a slightly slower\nheating ability. But the Pros do out weigh the Cons with amazing\nfeatures like : More accurate temperature control. Even heating of the materials (dry herbs or\noils). And a much lower risk of combustion. So when shopping for a conduction vaporizer,\nhere are the 3 main signs to look out for: 1. They generally have a battery powered heating\nchamber. 2. or an Open flame heating plates. 3. or a Butane Powered heating chambers. If you are after a convection vape, you need\nto look out for these features: 1. Firstly, an internal fan or forced air\nfans. 2. Fan assist function. 3. Or convection specific screens for the\nchamber. Now, before wrapping up, I wanted to answer\nsome common vaping questions. Firstly, what happens when I draw, is the\ninhale different to smoking? Vaporizing is different to smoking a cigarette. When vaping, it's important to take longer,\nslower draws or inhales and while some users inhale to the lungs others find\nthe effects work simply by holding the vapor in their mouth for a few minutes. This is very similar to the way one smokes\na cigar. Really the draw or inhale is all about your\npersonal preference. Some manufacturers may even offer suggestions\nor guides on how best to vape with their devices. Next, so how does your body consume the vapor\nso you feel its effects? Vapor is actually a form of gas, thus it causes\na reaction instantly. The body's ability to use this vapor works\nfaster because the lungs inhale it and then it is in your bloodstream right away. Many people use herbs this way for natural\nmedicinal or therapeutic reasons. What you are inhaling is the vapor of the\nessential oil or herb, so there is no digestive work that goes into inhaling vapor.\nWhich brings us to... Does vaporizing actually smell? Vaporizing is barely noticeable compared to\nother traditional methods such as smoking. Usually a window open will completely rid\nyour area of the smell within a few minutes. However, with a good quality device and if\nyou are using it properly, you should barely notice any smell at all. And finally, does vaporizing cause smoke? The actual burning of the material, whether\nit's oils or dry herbs is usually contained in some sort of glass bubble or inner chamber. Some large devices accumulate the vapor in\nbags or whips and you inhale it from them. Once you have inhaled or taken your draw the\namount of vapor expelled from your mouth is very minimal and this dissipates within a\nfew seconds to minutes. And that's it for your science lesson today\non vaping. We hope that you are now more informed about\nthe Science of Vaporizing and ready to go!", "chxmXCybr1Y": "what is up we have the Rascoe liquid live resin cultured pineapples fresh strange coming in

Cresco you got", "soN8WFRHtDI": "today I'm going to do a video on replacing a kitchen faucet this faucet here works but the mechanism inside it has stopped twisting as you can see here so that's probably due to chemicals in the water this sounds unwell so a couple things going to have handy lots of cloths just in case we get some water leaks to hang up or clean up a couple of containers to catch any water spillage and a couple of miscellaneous tools we'll use throughout the video so we have two valves one for the hot water one for the cold water I'm going to start by shutting the water off here now I'm always very gentle when I go to do this because the way I look at it these types of side here for years and years not being turned and as you can see there's a little resistance there so I just very gently start to turn those already you can see we have lots of water coming out there so I'm gonna grab one of those containers they should have put underneath in the first place but anyway like I said these taps have been just in one position for a year so start to work on them and things might be a little sticky so there we go I turned that clockwise to shut it down now I'll shut the other one off here actually on the white container under this one and then stop thinking over there now and again trying to be pressure on it but be kind of gentle here just easing the force onto it and that's that's pretty sticky this water is hard in this house it's on a well a lot of chemicals in it so anyway shut off your two valves there after you do that just go up and verify that actually everything is off so should be a little come out here now or not I've turned that so I turn it to the hot turn it to the cold just to make sure and I now know that the supply is off to this faucet this tap here is a pull out faucet on us so there's a weight hanging under the sink to make sure that that home back in there's a 2 Phillips head well actually one Philips head screwdriver there the other one or screw there the other one has fallen out or something so I'm going to take this weight off of there just to make a little easier to work around this thing and that's pretty much all there is there take that screw oats and beast then you don't have to have this weight banging around while you're working on the top okay the next step we're going to disconnect the connections for the hot and cold water supply on the existing faucet but I'm just going to show you a new faucet basically what we're doing it might be easier to tell these are the two fittings here that we have - they're connected obviously to the new faucet so we have to disconnect those and the existing ones so we go underneath the sink here what we just looked at on the new faucet is here and here so what we got to do is take a wrench hold this one in place and then here's our water supply the pipe here we gotta remove that let's see if I can hold the camera and do this might be different on your particular faucet but it's a 15 millimeter well actually has a little loose but that's I couldn't find what it was tighter tonight but I'm gonna use a 15 millimeter wrench be careful there because you don't want to strip anything but for lack of five finding a proper size 15 and down here this is a 22 millimeter so you hold that oops it's gonna be difficult to tape basically they'll hold this one in place on the top and take your bottom one and turn it hopefully this will show you see that gone counterclockwise as you look up so now I just loosen that off before we did that so if I take this random off of here you should be able to see what I'm talking about pull the top in place and turn that off make sure you get your little pan down below or whatever or be prepared to clean up the water once you're cut these off and just wiggle it gently you see that nut comes out of the hair I'm in this kind of simply maneuver that off we're going to stop recording okay once it comes out that's what you got I just basically wiggle it back and forth gently making sure to hold the pipe up there so it and break it and there's wiggle it back and forth until it kind of released so that's one of my water supply connections removed off of the pipe going up to the okay tour to our two water supply lines are disconnected and now if you can see up here be right at the bottom of the process this is keeping the faucet connected to the countertop itself there's these two Phillips head screwdrivers so I definitely cannot hold the camera and remove those what you're going to want to take those out remember righty tighty lefty loosey so you're going to be only lefty loosey or cantercot okay with those two Phillips head screws loosened off now there's large nut that the screws are in will now turn so I'll go counterclockwise and remove that like so okay I removed that large knife you can see that's hanging there but now this tap won't pull up through and the reason being is that this big nut won't go down on over all these parts hanging off of the D faucet so what I probably should have done was removed this not have my finger on there you see this the hose for the weight because the faucet is pull out is connected to this so I'm going to remove that now okay removing that faucet weight was a little easier than I thought there's just a Phillips head screwdriver on the side of it when I turn it around I spun it around and then it just popped right off like so and there's the hole that I remove the Phillips head screwdriver screw from so I'm just going to compact all these fittings together is this faucet is toast doesn't really care about what state it's in altogether they're small enough to pull up through and I'm going to remove that let that we loosened off befoe are the worst okay I got the slid off a bottom now with a little luck this faucet should theoretically pull up through it's over all right okay so the old faucet is off and now comes the fun part going to have to take couple minutes read the instructions for your new faucets like already I'm not going to go into the details of this particular faucet because you know they're all probably a little bit different but anyway I got to take this off of the new one and go through the process here okay so in this unit this piece here is going to go over like that faucet will be going obviously down through the middle I'm gonna have to go underneath the sink and this couple of bolts that are going to go in here I have to drill another hole here because the old faucet didn't required but anyway I'll drill a hole there and what's going to happen is these two pieces these two bolts are going to screw in like this they got a little bit of a squared off head so you can type them in want to be careful not to tighten that too much and then there's I can tell from the instructions going to be a couple of plastic bolts go on like that take them up from underneath okay once you get your pilot hole drilled and you can see that I kind of screwed up a little bit I have two of them because I drilled my first one and then I realized that was off a little bit but anyway that'll guide the drill that's the bit that's in your mandrel they're in nicely so once you have that in place just get a good grip on your drill start to operate it before it actually hits the surface the it's going to be guided in by the bit so it'll turn in your pilot hole I started to talk there and I realized I couldn't be heard so it's basically saying don't get too aggressive just let it kind of find its way through made me move the drill back and forth slightly and that'll basically get the job done okay so like I was saying tighten those Mountain mounting bolts up but very careful doing it because doesn't look like it's particularly strong in this mounting live here so then we're going to put our nuts on from underneath this thing just move that around a little bit till it seems to be properly placed and again like I said we'll take these nuts from below and tighten them on so underneath to think hopefully you can see this I'm just going to get these nuts on here turn a little pot wise and these are only made of plastic so once you get them up there where they tight just type one a bit then go to the the other one tighten it a little bit and go back and forth like that can't just be careful you don't want to break these so we got them tighten our bit then I tighten one on that side or the other one and just back and forth like that do you get this okay so the instructions tell me to take the rubber washer the metal washer and the knot and put them on the body here now I'm looking at the box and I can't find them and turns out that it's already on here so we're going to take these off put the faucet down through the hole of our sink and then he's on underneath okay so feed all these pieces down through now that we have that nut that I mentioned off of there and the two washers and I'm going to need two hands I think to do on it okay yeah I'm gonna have to stop taping anyway I'm gonna pop that down through the hole okay faucets in place now we gotta go down below and for this particular faucet as pretty instructions we're gonna feed the rubber washer the metal washer and the nut Oh see if I can get this on here those are going to go over just black hose and over our two connections to the supply lines I'll do that and then the plastic washer the metal washer and the nut are now connected to the bottle on the faucet so just take that knob okay I'm never fully tightened up there now the only purpose of that is to keep the faucet stable up above so if you don't get that quite tighten up sound like anything is going to leak you can always just go back and tighten up a little bit more I'm a firm believer in just tightening things as much as I figure they need as opposed to taking the risk of over tightening and breaking something you can always go back and tighten up your fittings or whatever later on anyway that's tightened up there now and from up above we see that as I tightened it it actually turned the whole faucet that's simple enough I just kind of move that back into place there straight okay this units structions tell me to screw the on to this black hose here which is the let's get that tightened up here which is the one that's going to hold our weight tighten that up and then we have hopefully you see this there's our two water lines and there's this other line here we take this and there's a tab on the end right there and we kind of line up this part here and let's see that you push weight up on to there I mean if I turn this this way air you heard that click there that's gone there good and to release it you're gonna push those tabs in but anyway so there now that hose is connected there there's our two hot cold water lines the other end of that but we just disconnected is but now we're ready to connect our water supply lines I'm just gonna get that into place the nut screw that on I'm going to stop recording is I want to hold this in such a way is knuck up putting the undue pressure on it and I'm going to need to hold up there with one wrench well tighten this nut here with another so I'll have to hold that steady with a wrench like we covered in the first part okay I got the two water supply lines tightened up a little hint that I I noticed while doing this is if you can kind of keep a bit of pressure on a hose if you have this type of water supply line pull that down a bad put some pressure just straight down as you're tightening up that nut it kind of keep everything in place anyway then we got to put this weight on again the other side of this weights gets just got two Phillips head screws there I'll put that on okay I tightened up the two Phillips head screw draw a screws that are on that weight so now it's time for the big test so again very gently because as I say he's not too often that a person turns off the water supply lines to their top just turn on these two types on your supply line once you get it kind of to the end they just turn it back just a little bit I'll do that to the other one okay so both supply lines are turned on the moment of truth here alright no mess around with this top a little bit see how it actually functions anyway so I'm gonna let that one and then you want to go down take a good look down below make sure you don't have any leaks if you do turn off your supporter supply again and tighten up your not to my cotta thing seems to be okay okay any leaks here let's load it", "25ZPhrmHCNs": "holy [ __ ] that one that one was hot I'm excited to have my hands on this so I can finally give it a try this is the 710 labs life resin pod I've had a lot of 7-10 labs concentrate to my day but this is totally new to me I haven't even opened the box yet yeah comes with a little instruction manual and the pot got a live little peek C logo they put it on all the cartridges I always just pull it off I'm not gonna lie it looks like there's pretty good stuff in there it looks super thick I usually [ __ ] with 7/10 labs so I expect this to be a pretty good experience here's what it looks like with the battery that you have to buy separately because I don't know any other battery company that makes up pod for this this is [ __ ] weird I don't know any company that has a pod like this and I don't know any battery company that makes a battery like this so this is super unique I don't really think that's a good thing but let me try the pin out before I voice my opinion [Music] that's pretty smooth really doesn't have a crazy taste I hid it until it wouldn't let me hit it anymore it's on a full charge I don't think this battery changes heat settings but it does have like a light indicator here and when it's green it's above 50% then when it's 20 percent to 49 it'll go to blue and then it's at red when it's below 20 percent battery so that's kind of cool you can know where your battery life is actually at all right that hid a little better in swears usually the first date of a car or a pen usually the best one and then it just gets progressively worse but that second head was way nice done the first one I want to point out the definite difference in color between the box and the actual pen like this is a actually angry oily color and then on the box it looks like it's like bright yellow I've had the Z or Z before I thought it was called C Oz but the guidance offender told me it's called zoz so I've been going with it when I dad did it tasted a lot better than it does out of this pen but this is their cure for which is like their lower level actually believe it's the lowest here I think they just do it 1 2 3 or 4 so that might be one of the taste isn't that great it's not bad but like I've had some cards recently where I'm like damn this is so [ __ ] flavorful and there's light pressing cartridges this is a la Crescent cartridge and I'm really not getting a crazy flavor up [Music] definitely starting to feel the effects a little bit and then nice little head higher I do want to say it is very smooth this is a waste another hit that I really ever expected out of a cartridge this is definitely some new technology I really don't think I like it though like this battery shape I do really like actually it's pretty sleek but the charger and the USBC and like who has that I mean I actually like you so I guess I can't fish but I have one USBC charger in my house and I have like 50 normal USB chargers I don't think a lot of people have USB C charges just laying around like a couple people do but not like the vast majority which is I think what you should still hate or - I know 7/10 laughs is more of a higher-up company but it's just like they were like how could we make this as difficult as possible let's find a pallet battery that nobody has ever used before so people have to buy the battery now let's give them an annoying charger like I don't know I feel like they were just like trying to be annoying when they were making this battery but for all I know in two years this battery is going to be the standard and I'm probably gonna be eating my words and they were totally ahead of the game [Music] this really doesn't give you a long blinkers man the design on this pen is definitely cool it's pretty trippy I like how it kind of wraps around the side of the pen so each side you get a little bit of something like doesn't have that weird no sniffle either I just realized you know how sometimes when you smoke a cartridge you're like really tickles your nose this is not that at all the total THC is 80 point four one percent and the total CBD is 0.1 nine and eighty percent THC is pretty high for a pen actually a lot of especially on the black market a lot of pens though a 97 percent THC and a cartridge and it's like bro if your pen is 97 percent THC like it would not burn them those wicks that is not possible honestly anything above 80 is not gonna burn very easily in a normal cartridge so I've always been wearing when I've seen like 85 90 percent even in the PA market I've seen it before I've seen th see that's like 95 percent THC just to live like tested in a jar and it's like a [ __ ] Rock I just don't see how I could possibly get that in the cartridge damn that is actually Sunday pretty hard now yeah dude 710 labs get your [ __ ] baked sorry for the lack of content on my page recently you guys got some big things on the way I don't want to share them until it's officially out but I'm super excited to share with you what I have going on with popcorn in the near future and obviously when I was in Denver the last week of it we got my dog spayed so I was actually like kind of busy being attentive to her and then since I've been back I've been getting my house ready because my girlfriend's actually moving in with me her lease is up in September but she's just kind of over being in Colorado so she's gonna fly here with Piper next week so I've been getting my house prepared because I've lived here by myself the entire time which there's enough space for both of us but I've definitely spread out all my [ __ ] so I've been consolidating stuff and you know just getting everything prepared so when she moves back here she can just move right in I was thinking about doing another Q&A video too so if there's any questions you have you can leave a comment in the YouTube video I'm gonna try to pull as many off yours I can oh my god man I'm setting to get pretty [ __ ] big I'm not gonna lie oh my god feels good to be back you ever get like so big sometimes that you feel like you're like a different person so and you're like wow I like literally feel like I'm like an alter-ego all of a sudden like I am not the same person I was 20 seconds ago nothing really anything serious it's just like you were like in a bad mood and now all of a sudden you're just carefree like well it is like Jeff too has arrived it is a whole new version of me I remember the first time I took a gigantic dab it was like four weeks into that like I was thinking blobs but like I don't like a half gram that like it was ridiculous and I remember like I was so high but like I was almost tripping if you guys have seen the movie the masks where Jim Carrey has like this alter-ego were he like puts on a green mask and he's like a totally different like crazier person I felt like that was me oh whoa okay I am the man in the mask right now holy [ __ ] like I am lit but usually I'll just get super awkward what am i honestly I'm super awkward when I'm sober it's like a social anxiety I have I just I don't know I don't know what to say sometimes I don't know what to do like what I do with my hands work put like what the [ __ ] I'm just weird brah but please if you ever seen me in public and want to say I feel free to even though I'm a little after it I really don't mind I think it's going to meet you guys it kind of helps but I face the the people I'm making videos for and all I are super [ __ ] chill I don't know what it is but everyone haven't met it's been like nothing but kind of friendly Beckham I say what's up oh but I'm curious how long this is going to take the bat out still looks like there's a decent amount of oil in there two giant air bubbles on this side really doesn't have the best taste though like the highs nice it's okay when you actually think with just a glee about buying your own separate pen having to have this whole separate pot system it's just too much the flavor was alright at first but it's really really lawful flavor it's like resin it's not dis Calypso it should be a little bit better flavor you think but I am getting so high yeah I really honestly think I'd rather just buy gram of 7/10 left like Ross and the BIOS pen and battery I feel like at least at the cost of what it is now I feel like this is going to be more of a gimmicky thing or more for like the heady boys that just want to have it but really isn't for like that everyday smoked beer like this isn't really something you need to have oh I guess where these blinkers aren't too rough on you I'm trying something to spend in one sitting but I don't know if it's gonna happen guys this really shouldn't taste as bad as it does for the amount of oil that's still left in there there's gonna be a long day boys holy [ __ ] that one down what was i that [ __ ] hurt oh my god that was intense but double records how you do it boys oh my god [Music] oh yeah it tastes like [ __ ] that - we'll just burn through it right oh my god I'm getting so I I have to be getting pretty close to the end there's some giant air bubbles in there please and soon and drops in this video if you take one second just like like for me I would really appreciate it it goes a long way you'd be surprised what a like would do so if you're watching any of my videos and you like it please click like I'd really appreciate it this one's for everybody that clicks like triple oh my god hope you got oh that hurts a bad one I do that goddamn whoo it's weird how a pen high is so much different than like a weed high it's looking at joint we're so gonna pen like if I took this many hits of a joint I would be a totally different high it's not like I'm not high though it's just that like a joint just hits different and like weed dabs just hit different than pens I don't know what it is I feel like if I took it dab with the amount of stuff I just smoked chances are I'd be higher off the dad I don't know though maybe that's just me god be suck no no I to die one have so many levels of emotions on me so I'm like this is awesome it's like it's okay it's like all right that's pretty cool it's like this sucks like this isn't such an emotional roller coaster I really don't know how to feel about these when I had the live resident of the cr-z it was way tastier than this like I was actually like my blood how pasty it was I was like wait this is Rossum like that's how good I thought it was and then now I'm like hitting this pen only yeah this is trash I don't think I've ever had any string of seven ten laps that was Tier four so maybe once they hit Tier four it is really just like the bottom of the barrel but there's so many better things you can buy at the dispensary instead of this and RJ even from 7-10 labs like the amount of money it cost for a battery and the pot itself it's like just by a grandma live rosin it'll go a lot longer and be a lot more enjoyable like this this sucks no cold is this telling me I don't see it anywhere dude the amount of information Colorado gives you is nuts like versus Pennsylvania like this is the one thing that blows my mind this is the kind of information you get out of one of your most popular Colorado companies you know you get the THC CBD batch number yada yada in Pennsylvania they have the date of his package do they have like a code for the person who packaged it they have the THC the CBD the CBN the CBC all that [ __ ] there's so much more testing in Pennsylvania you really have a better idea what you're actually smoking when you get [ __ ] from PA it cost so much goddamn money though [Music] this thing's hitting hard however it tastes like [ __ ] dirt getting up triple I'm so so almost empty you can see my hand oh my god I decide to ever oh my god you guys I'm so [ __ ] high it's not getting any better but hits are a little less intense though so that's giving me hope that this pods almost done if there's one thing I can say it's that the pod is in full effect right now I still stand by my statement that taking it dab of this amount would give me higher though I actually asked my battery's about to die and I feel like I got close enough that's what I'm gonna call the video I'm not gonna smoke any more of this so click like if you enjoyed I really did not enjoy this pot but if you enjoyed the video make sure you click like subscribe for more video it's got a lot more on the way leave a comment let me know a Q&A question for a future video but thank you guys so much for watching my name is Jeff peace I'll hit you with a goodbye rip", "VR-JgUCTvhw": "so guys welcome back to the channel got a nice easy video today we've got a problem with a faulty tap the cup taps constantly running we've got water hammer today I'm going to show you how to repair it so lowly intro well go so here we are at our tap first thing we need to do is isolate the water because we'll be taking their taps apart and we don't want water to be going everywhere so that's what we're gonna do so what has now been isolated and what we're going to do is just release any water from inside the taps so open up both hot and cold feed and nothing comes out so what we're going to do is just close them back off now oxide so the next thing we need to do then is just undo the screw now I know the fault is from the cold side so what I'm going to do is just pop off the blue cover and with a screwdriver and release the the top of the tap so for this all you need is a Philips screwdriver and an adjustable spanner adjustable wrench so let's do that now so now we have our blue cover removed and with our Philips just unscrew the screw that locks the holds of the tap onto the spine of the gland so there as you can see we have a go and expose so all we're going to do now is River adjustable just loosen that off not so and there is nickel on top grams now if I've never I selected the water water would have just been gushing out of here which is not good more work and more mess to clean up and start pair of half-inch and tap lungs insert a new gland do finger tight and then just nip it up with adjustable well so now that tap should not be leaking so what we're going to do is just switch the water back on see if the replacement gland has worked very very simple fix so guys the water is now on and up to pressure so what we'll just do as you can see there is no dripping from the top so what we'll do is just turn their hot on yep and the cold now this is not screwed on I've just put it on for ease to turn the top on so fully open fully closed as you can see the replacement glanders works so what i'm going to do now is just nip this up pop the cover back on and that's the job done so guys I hope you've found the video interesting and useful and maybe somebody out there will benefit from this video so guys thanks for watching please like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next one until then take care bye bye", "2vNcJssxFjA": "how simple it is to refill your logic pro cartridges all you need is the liquid of your choice a syringe standard hypodermic syringe a 26 gauge blunt point needle your old spent cartridges and a little bit of patience first you fill your cartridges yeah I'm just syringe using routine method of pulling the liquid whatever your choice of liquid is into your cartridge once that's done you have to load your cartridge the cartridge gets loaded simply by putting the cap back on that it came with putting the end cap that you already pre-drilled a hole in it pushing the needle into the cartridge up to but don't exceed this point here which is where the coil is if you go too far you tend to possibly break the heating element of the atomizer now once that's done it's very simple is turn it upside down hold the unit together and pull on the cartridge that's evacuating the air that's in there since it's upside-down you'll see actual bubbles come in see him and now you let it go and it fills up now you turn it upside down wait until the air bubbles go up to the top suck out more air by pulling on the cartridge I'm sorry pulling on the syringe holding it all together turning it upside down again and letting it fill and you're done it's as simple as that you could do it a third time if you like if you really really have to get it super full once again while it's upside-down like this you pull out the air hold it turn it upside down and now it fills back up that's it it's as simple as that I take the top off at this point and slowly remove the needle down to the end and take out any of the liquid that's in the chamber that you draw out of and you're finished and good luck", "69WZQ9Kt8Uc": "all right how's it going guys I got this Mon Foss that I've had for about four years started leaking at the base which means oh ringing is bad so I need to replace that and I also need to replace these cartridges because one of these is leaking so a great thing about Moen is they have a great warranty policy I basically had this for four years and they sent me all the stuff I need for you know to fix these but both these leaks with free shipping included so I can't say that works for all of them but what we're going to do here is we're going to replace first I'm going to replace this we'll do this in the first video and then the next video oh I'll do these cartridges so basically what you need for this this is kind of like this wrench here so you don't scratch any of the chrome I forget what this thing's called you just tighten around here and you just turn it and it's really easy so once I loosen that up I got that Sears there just hand I'm screwed okay hold on okay this one has a nut so so basically you pull this up again I'd screw this loosen this bar I've already got the you don't need the water shut-off on this on this one a lot of crows in there okay I'm gonna clean this real quick and then I'll be back okay I got all that cleaned off okay when you get that all cleaned off just want to do is water it place these o-rings I only have two rings on this one they sent me three so that's about any way we do as you uh want to take this this hot grease stuff but they send with you or that they send to you and you want to cover this black Oh ring real good with it but you know what you might want some gloves put that on because I'm sure it's real greasy and I don't know what's in it anyway so I really don't want it on my hands so let's take some of this stuff now I'm gonna go ahead and coat this black o-ring and you just want to coat it real good that's probably pretty good I'll set right there I'm gonna take the old balls off I'm gonna take it out I'm gonna take this screwdriver here yes I probably should have done which would have been smarter is taking these off first before I coated my gloves in Greece but a his first time doing this okay that's the old one that's y'all I think I'm going to you I'm gonna go ahead and coat doesn't say in the directions to coat this but I don't see why you can't okay okay now take you'll take the new one now that I got that just put that on there just like that okay now one thing I did notice my gloves are pretty pretty greasy so I'm getting grease all over the handle so I'm gonna take a couple other gloves anyone this is cheap vinyl one and go ahead and put those on okay so now I'm gonna show this down a hand tight this thing okay go ahead and take this up a little bit here I don't know if you have to I can get my faucet out of there so I don't know some people just pull it right out but I couldn't do it without tightening that thing so that was kind of weird then you just want to hand tight this all the way down pretty hand tight know what you want to do is is take your wrench think taken like this yeah yeah should be it okay that should be it if it's now I'll find out when I turn this sucker on yeah okay sorry I had to make sure I tighten that or not it seemed like it was tightening oh yeah it is so I'll just tighten that a little bit more okay should be good so that's how you replace the o-ring and now to video number two thanks guys", "oZZ__SwYzgQ": "here here chillin thanks out of beat stop whether silver changed it drop down with a pot like 60 63 degrees today it's not bad the wind's blowing like crazy but

it's not a cart you would buy you know with wax in it it's an empty cart made by kind pen which makes them solid solid DAB pens I think like very reliable so I thought I'd grab the cart see what it's like I got some ak-47 in there at the moment some fire but with these I definitely would not recommend them if you have kind of thicker wax or if you do I'd mix it with some you know glycerin or something some thinner but I never knew they made cartridges I just thought they made depends but you can see plastic tip plastic middle part not it's not glass but I don't mind that you can see see it's a wick and there let me see if I can get this well you can see the wick but I would definitely only use these if you have some bitter oil to put in there or maybe get if you have the girl we will get just a cart with a coil or just a vaporizer in general you know but if you have something wax I can definitely see these being extremely useful they're pretty cheap they're like there's what like five bucks I think six bucks like you could definitely if you have a you have a significant amount of distillate I would definitely recommend these just to you know they're disposed not disposable but you know what I mean they're just they're cheap they're they're easy and putting in the putting in the wax isn't too hard it's just a classic wick wick top with the rubber plunger not bad at all - not hard at all but if you have some thin thin oil to get in there and definitely get this you have some thicker stuff I'd recommend you know something with a coil or thinner wax or something but thank you", "iX7Zcy6J0-Y": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we got another educational review yet again everybody we do not condone these products this is an 18 and of Education review from the cannabis patients out there but today everybody we got another King pen I decided to pick two up just because I know I noticed that I've reviewed King pen before this is a King Louie og by the way some indica I've noticed that I've I've only copper King pen like once now I just had to review a second one and now this is my third one that I'm reviewing on this channel I think this is the third one that I'm gonna be on the channel but this is some King Louie we got it right here shout out Disney's for sponsoring this video this is actually a glow-in-the-dark shirt but it fits perfect for the King Lily so shares everybody oh wow this one makes a lot more fatter clouds in the cartridge video I did before so you guys have watched the Kali the Kali oh oh I wasn't actually make able to make big clouds and I'm like okay maybe it's just the airflow of the cartridge but this one is the exact same size and last time I actually didn't have it on the lowest temp so let's go back to the lowest ten I like taking them low temps just so for the flavor the last one we did was Callie oh and again let me let me take another hit Lucy oh yeah something's wrong with the other cartridge that I did haven't talked about at all like damn is this what happened that color went out of the airflow this one I'm already late with this one with the King Louie just literally like to dress oh that flavors nice mmm has like a cereal taste to it like if you guys ever tried um what is it rice krispies or crispy rice crisps you know there's Cocoa Krispies and the other rice krispies the colorful ones pebble pebbles I think pebble crisp dude I honestly don't even know like a fruity yes I got like a sweet fruit type of type of flavor which is pretty nice and I'm not gonna lie damn King Penn what's up with that man I mean we got the callee oh that [ __ ] did not hit well you know what's funny to some of them actually don't hit well like I've noticed that this that wasn't the first time so if you guys watched my previous video on the kingpin Caleo review um I wasn't able to take like big ribs like this one like I wasn't able to make some time like you know nice clouds oh this one you can make some nice clouds and it tastes nice just the one thing is indica so this just about having me slept but damn that's funny cuz I remember I had a I had a friend that actually bought a half game card to we're hearing it and we're both like what the hell it doesn't really have like good like it has air flow but you can't really make clouds and you don't feel like you take a nice hit out of it so I'm just like maybe just something with the cartridges that maybe they're just a little they're just a little delicate you know kind of made this flavor does taste really good though the King Louie I had this before the King Louie og hell yeah [ __ ] like it kind of has like an OG taste to it I mean its own g-get also supposed to taste I go dude but you can kind of you could taste say you know like I said before I've talked about this before King Penn was one of those brands and I first started when I started buying cartridges and [ __ ] days ago so it's always nice to go back to the roots you know and that's what I was talking about in the last year too like I was just saying that come pretty much like it's always nice going back to the roots you know I wanted I actually the review of brass knuckle cartridge just because brass knuckles was one of the first cartridges that I've ever you know smoked before so that's for sure has to be here on the channel but I don't see those allow anymore like right now it's all it's literally select and raw garden selecting wrong our name but rock garden is my all-time favorite everybody and the select is pretty nice too that she gets me baked um but check this out you guys so it's kingpin it's the world's most awarded cannabis vape is this still up to date is this still the most important in 2019 let me know in the comments down below the alien labs is also my favorite when it comes to like some sauce diamonds ooh ooh shout-out look the lights are matching the shirts kind of matching huh let me know in the comments down below if you guys have ever tried kingpin and if you guys have any issues with kingpin cuz I've had one one issue with kingpin before don't get me wrong the taste is great you know the flavors are great to have a bunch of flavors you know I got I mean every time I hit this [ __ ] I get pretty late you guys said clearly see you have to like my second or third drag I got [ __ ] lit but again last time my previous purchase was a Cali oh and that one had too much air flow like it had good airflow but it wasn't really burning like this one is burning you know so I didn't get me like it got me lit but it gave me super lit you know it tasted it did taste good though but we're gonna find out I'm gonna have to remake another video and um see exactly if it doesn't because if you guys can see it right here look let's see right here I didn't show you guys a cartridge yeah there you got the cartridge this one for some reason this one doesn't focus that much like either tell it clear or who knows but you guys see towards the bottom of it it's like okay towards the top it's a little bit more yellow than the bottom because in the bottom it's like really tight down there you know so not a lot of like I'm not a lot of the liquid is going down there so you guys he usually right here in these areas right here it gets stuck I feel like some of the liquid gets stuck so when you finish the cartridge it's like literally like you feel like there's like a layer that just won't be smoked no matter how many times you hit it it just won't burn because last time when I got one of these this was a while ago this is maybe like a year ago when I got it I got myself a king actually no it was the first king no that was probably maybe like maybe like three months ago three four months ago we had a king pen cartridges are the same half gram in it we got it all the way to the bottom right and they were just like a thick nice little layer and I'm like okay cool it still has a lot started hitting it and I was like dude it takes burnt and I looked at it and I was like dude that layer is just stuck right there it's not going in and it's not going in the coils you know so I was like what the hell I was like I hope it's just maybe like a the thinnest little leftover layer like [ __ ] I don't mind but it looked pretty big it looked like almost like 1/3 so I'm like dude in any other cartridge that's gonna fall all the way to the bottom and it's gonna get soaked up into the coils and it's gonna give you a hit you know is that I know a lot of people you guys I'm pretty sure you guys know how this works right there's like little coils that heat up inside this so this kind of every time you take a hit it burns the it burns the liquid that's in there already and then it leave it kind of you can see like it dries off the cotton or dries off the coil and then this liquid goes in there it gets soaked up and it's like you know it's the circle of life until it's gone but if you guys hello if you guys are enjoying these cartridge videos make sure you guys go down in description go follow all my social media you guys are enjoying these videos drop a like comment down below I'll let you guys know what and then subscribe you guys right now click that bell so you guys get notified every time I upload but leave a comment down below let me know what is you guys's favorite all-time cartridge because I've got a lot of people asking me the comments that there is just so many like you guys drop comments right and you guys let me know the stuff that you guys are smoking in your area and I'm just like okay you know I gotta keep there's people dropping comments you know from the east coast from Europe and I'm just like brah what the [ __ ] I got I had a couple people from like Philly Canada oh I'm just naming all types of [ __ ] places but this is like connecting it's like a video to the world so that's stuff that's [ __ ] sick bro I didn't know it like our first one I started their selves like okay maybe I'm gonna get people from Cali watching my stuff then people started dropping from other places like what damn and again everybody these are just podcasts they're literally just like a podcast or just kind of the spheres in shape because we're kicking back you know we're keeping this pretty much raw you know you know what's funny I'm hella way I'm just looking here this is YouTube recommend you guys like the weirdest videos cuz lately I've been watching a bunch of fire ants versus bird-eating tarantula and I'm like what the [ __ ] like I've seen I follow this channel called ants Canada or something like that he shows like his ant colonies and I'm like oh [ __ ] that I guess how the hell did I get like how am i watching is and then a while back I was watching videos about like spiders and tarantulas and all that stuff and I'm like dude what the hell YouTube recommends me the most weirdest [ __ ] ever yeah what to get it is it flashes on fire every cartridge that I get I gotta I always make sure that it's like someone good cuz I know you guys seen a couple cartridges on these channels like for example old pals or the which one of the Humboldt forms I think yeah that was like the strawberry straw man has something like that um I looked at like more of like the the details of the cartridge you know the information the stuff that's in the cartridge you know I try to do my research on that but I looked at the details and you know unlike the stuff that's in there and I'm just like okay this is kind of clean this is pretty uh this is pretty safe to smoke and it's fire you know it's probably a good review you know is that's why you know this is like more like this is like an educational Channel so I gotta I want to make sure that I even I review even like the low key brands you know the brands that people don't really like I feel like eases like right here I don't know do you guys what kind of delivery services do you guys have so the final verdict I like the flavor and the design of it's pretty cool it got me pretty loaded and taste it tasted good but those I was pretty cool it's just that one thing the airflow this one had great this one had great airflow like I could make clouds the other one the callee oh that [ __ ] did not have good like it had good airflow and it felt the same but it just was not making clouds so I don't know what's wrong with that I was gonna get a full gram but they didn't have full grams so I was just like [ __ ] I'm gonna just get two so hope you guys enjoyed this video make sure hands up like a comment subscribe click that Bell you guys gonna find it so you guys can notified every time I upload and [Music]",

have but I want to go ahead and look at this one this is my favorite I like Strawberry Cough there are 0.75 in here they may even have the label on the coil in there that's pretty sick and take a look at the results and these are tested like a week ago then these are pretty cool so here in Michigan we just went through like a a band type thing I'll distill it all vapor products so you couldn't get any of these for like the last like three weeks you literally couldn't get any carts or anything so it's been a little hard and then these just dropped today so that's it's pretty dope there all seemed to be filled up pretty well I think there's like you see that babe this uh it's not like clear it's like uh I don't know how to say it but it's not instant I don't know I'll open it up and we'll see it might be a cover it kind of looks like it but I'm gonna go ahead and take this out oh so this is pretty cool so this battery is compatible with Joule pods also yeah so you can put your jewel on top of here and smoke it damn it's kinda heavy has some weight to it this little thing has some weight do church is always awesome winter product stretches on everything widget everything then you got your little jewel pod compatible thing right here just take this I'm pretty sure you just drop it right in here just like that yep then you just put your jewel pod on top of there that's [ __ ] sick all right I got a button down here Oh in that lights up green blue white Green I wanted on green that's what they said you use it on - there's really no instruction that came others on the back I'll show you guys this three settings the white 3.0 2.7 3.7 is green 4.1 is blue all of a sudden light on the bottom means that it's it's dead and it was red so it's pretty much dead so this thing actually needs to charge 410 miles it's pretty cool and surge protected so it's never gonna overheat let's go ahead and open the Strawberry Cough here so how I like to open them as you grab both sides like that just kind of wiggle it out they have a different way of doing it but we all have a different way of doing everything and you got this little box in here you can either take that out or you can just grab the pod and just grab it like so Dan this is dope so it does have like a cloudy plastic type on it it is not clear so that's that's pretty cool that's new it's different it's kind of thick too you can see that it's not it's not just a half gram it's a full 7.5 and you got your bubble somewhere up in there kind of see it right there show the back real quick this is the peanut collision the pods are 0.75 they're not a half gram through a point seven-five so you can take a hit off of this before it dies so we're just gonna go ahead and match the search up a church put it in there okay maybe it needs to be in the other side I guess they hit the head oh that tasted good first hit on the M on pod Strawberry Cough one percent is seventy two point three as a very high strawberry taste to it it's like strawberry lemonade type almost there's a very clean flavor though very clean that's good as [ __ ] that's good as [ __ ] go ahead and take one more ripoff of these girlfriend just hit this and how did you like it yeah actually is pretty good vapor production for how small it is alright I love how small it is you can just hold this in your hands no no if you could see in there but you create we created two bubbles hidden into these a couple times now these batteries range from like think it was in charge they wouldn't let me buy more than one but tomorrow they should be stocking batteries and these are $30 at $35 depending where you go and then you get these carts right here for forty to forty five dollars but this thing is pretty cool you just hold it in your hand and just no I don't even know we did go ahead and die so I'm going to end the video here just wanted to make this little clip right here about this new m1 pods you're gonna be doing reviews on some of these other pods I got I got a few more that I'm not showing here got another bag but yeah these things are pretty cool if you do see these I do recommend these but they are kind of expensive to maintain not maintained but keep up with they do have a dual attachment so that's pretty cool go on the top of there and you can smoke your jewel a nine out of ten flavor straight-up 10 out of 10 not even online I love this Strawberry Cough it's one of my favorite strains ever good ass quality pen right here it's not even a pendant it's like a disposable type I don't know Church does the best to fire", "56al0uhC9qM": "hey yo what's up guys I see y'all down there today we're talking about conserving carts with v-juice and if a lot of you don't know some carts not all not all good sup you're like they'll get like you can take off the top screw that off damn just like open parts what you can do is if say you're waxed it's you to like down here like barely above you take babe cheese stick it in that hair right there if you stick it in this little hole between the glass and this little tube you could actually fill out with juice and if you like say you take it right you take this car fillable juicing kind of just slowly go around and around move around sometimes you want take a lighter heat it up the glass get that extra t-h-e concentrate off you just kind of roll it through and then that kind of mixing any liquid THC combination all right so if you want to talk about if it's healthy well it is like it's definitely possible to do you just saw me like like if you can see how fast it goes so you know there's like vape juice in it like that's fast really bad you've seen my videos before buy my car reviews and they were like them Alice Lowe Alice low but [ __ ] but I mean it is healthy for you like technically like it's not bad for you I don't saying like it has nicotine stuff in it but you can put it on nicotine Nash's VG and PG you're pretty and that's not really gonna do anything for you just kind of get to flavor it will flavor up your cart a bit give me some nice nice flavor but I would I would recommend it honestly I did this a lot especially when I was a younger younger like breath it was like what my freshman year of high school or some [ __ ] long ago I put like these little three [ __ ] babe uses and like my cartridge is it [ __ ] I get so smacked how long but now it's just like something keep it up you can still get high off it if you fill it up with dreams you could definitely still get [ __ ] up because there's already wax in the glass and [ __ ] all over now you're just kind of scraping the player up bottom of the barrel with do not try water I've had friends of mine I tell them it works with juice they put water in it don't don't do that just [ __ ] up your [ __ ] like I know the normal person wouldn't thing but there are some people who think it's fine like I think it'll be okay no it's not don't do that stupid like it's just kind of the same juice how to put this pod but do it quick yeah but it's definitely it definitely works I do like it I mean it's not too bad I mean hello by new cart well you're scare some money then definitely investing because these are like two milliliters or a gram is like probably like two milliliters probably tank wise so I mean thug you get a normal bottle for 20 bucks since got like 30 grams 30 milliliters Phillip carts like 15 times don't keep refilling them that will burn it eventually but like I mean you could resell it and use it what do you want there's kids my own size for the dogs yeah we're bad feet okay alright be shoes I'm sorry problem with the dogs scare you outside world people walking their children around but yeah back on topic these they're good it works yeah so I mean it's probably not the best a lot of people might not advise it because there is like for me a lot people make a team don't open a teen in their veins which is you can do zero nickel but I'm gonna Nick teen I got 50 making this right now yeah I like it it's good but definitely I'd say it works for me my work for you if it doesn't work for you then don't do it if you try doesn't work you don't like it don't have to use that juice longer use youths on anything sell the bottle online you only use to Miller's practically brand new say it's brand new sell it it's good but yeah but all I got let's take one last double hit and then we all go home I'm already home what you know I'm going to order done make sure you guys can see you wrote on that's what we call good IV stirs I got my breath back okay I'll see you a veces next video and leave a like and subscribe if this helped you peace out", "JYcC1RudsfU": "[Music] what is up guys but from hey buds have I got some exciting news for you from Rove for new disposable pens from Rove all the same flavors you're used to right now they've only got Skywalker og tangi and wahwee og while we the most popular flavors by far four row but check it out this is going to make your arsenal complete it's got 0.4 grams of oil same oil they use in their other pens but they've made it disposable 0.4 grams you say that sucks well as you know the oil from Rove is a lot thicker which means the battery needs to be a lot hotter for that oil to burn so instead of getting a half a gram or even a full gram in a disposable you get halfway through it the battery dies you're pissed off you're at a concert or you're somewhere where you're using your disposable and and it doesn't work so what they found is this is the best combination for the consumer so there you go hot off the press if your dispensary doesn't have it yet get on them find out when they're getting them and load up I'm sure they're going to come out with more flavors in the in the near future and I will let you know when that's happening but right now check it out disposables everybody loves the disposable so there you go hop on it let me know how you like them I've only had it for a day and and really loving it so hope you enjoy like subscribe share the video let people know that it's out there and we'll see you soon [Music]", "wzAiMqD68v8": "hey everyone and thanks for tuning in my name is Stefan and I'm here to bring you a review of the Jeep NGO and the cookies CBD pods here we have the Jeep NGO it's about the same size as a jewel pen and the same width but it's much beefier if it's not made out of metal it's definitely made out of a very hard plastic and feels very durable here we have the cookies CBD pods as you see it's very nice packaging inside also very nice packaging however the container that the physical pod comes in I did find to be the best quality but it gets the job done this is the inside container I was talking about it's branded with the g-pen logo it also has a childproof lock so you have to press down pretty hard to get it open and inside floating around loosely is your g-pen pod now to insert your pod into the pen you'll see on one side there's a grooved edge and you want to get that and match it up with the grooved edge on the pen you're just gonna put that in and you have to actually press down pretty hard to get it in there so now we're gonna do the taste test of the cookies gelati pod and we're going to do a performance test as well [Music] the overall performance of the pen is good it's a little bit harder of a pool and you have to pull for a significant amount of time to feel like you're getting any real vapor out of it the taste for the brand cookies and the man behind it burner I was expecting a little more but it doesn't taste bad it's a little more herbal tasting but it's not that turfy taste you're gonna get from a THC pot it's more mellow it's more laid-back and it's definitely more herbal in conclusion the pen is $20 and the pods are 40 to 95 retail however gran cosines offers a 10% discount for signing up for their emails you can also do a refer friend and get a discount that way so you could definitely get these for a little bit cheaper than our advertise the pen for $20 is a great deal I mean the build quality is phenomenal on it the pods I'm not so sure about 40 to 95 on those they could be a little bit cheaper if you get them for cheaper I say they're worth it try it out if you have to pay full retail for these I just want it I don't think they're that good at tasting I think you can find another product somewhere else but overall a solid pen", "a2prr9ZiFxA": "this is a very common type of tap this one is actually started leaking it's lightly dripping some spoilers actually dripping down the side and down the back as it would happen it's actually start doing it now since a time the tupple because it's up was a bit loose but it's not going to stay up for long you want be longer folks live skipping again it's like they're filling the unit below with water so I'm going to keep the cartridge in this tub new cottage looks like that's this simply got a sealing ring at the bottom and then you've got the lever on the top so these are normally very easy to change they're not cheap that one was 9 pounds when you compare that to the price of an actual tub washer these do work out quite expensive we're going to start off by putting the plug in and then nothing can get lost down there now we're going to take a pair of players and we're going to pull out that point just so as indicator indicates we sadly awesome to call this so I've never moved that small piece and you'll notice is a small upper piece still in there we can grab that over a plate and pull out like so it can be difficult getting the actual lever off these tabs because what happens is you tend to get a buildup of lime scale etc which tends to fuse it onto the actual leaver saw that plastic part there the metal this slides on that I do have a skirt what I only can see that there is considerable pitting and corrosion in there and what tends to happen is that tends to get stuck in there so it can be difficult getting that part of the lever of the actual cartridge before we're going further we're going to isolate the wall see which as you can see is now being switched off when I want to get a torch we're going to share that into that hold sometimes either a slotted screw and sometimes they are an X key if you look through there you can just see that this one is actually an X so we're not going to feel in there until we find the grub screw then we're going to undo that I just lost side side the top for them in it we're not going to get all of the handle and pull it off these can be quite difficult to get off so we're just going to give it a spin they're using some 340 on the straw that is actually coming but it is very difficult because it is very tight and eventually it will come off lights all as you can see that is actually full of water so when I was going to be covered the gloves glue man if you're putting back in later on we're now need to remove the shroud that can be incredibly difficult to remove without damaging it so to remove that we're going to use a strap wrench these are very useful pieces of equipment and these can be used to remove things like this without actually put in any teeth marks on them or anything like that so if you've never used one of these before it actually has a narrow one which shows the direction which it needs to be pulled in so we're going to hook that around the shroud we're going to push it on and then we're going to try it and undo it using that we can't actually undo that at this moment in time so I'm just going to put some tissue in there and try and saw cup all the water and then I'm going to give that a spray with some skeletons and I'm just going to leave that to soak in for 10 minutes or so now I'm going to take a strap wrench again you can see that that has now formed on the shroud so light is the typical part in fact that it's very unusual we've actually removed the shroud and the not normally those two components are separate and normally you remove the shroud first and then remove the knot so it can now pull the cylinder out if you look at that you can see that's got some wire bit sign it's not supposed to be like art it is supposed to be all blue so that's see always probably the bit that is causing the problem we're not going to put the new cartridge in position it is important you get this to correct way around it is pretty easy to do because of those two logs which meets up with two holes that are drilled into the actual tab so we know that it definitely fits that way around so we can now just push that in until it got into the two locating looks now that we've separated these two components it will be a lot easier to stop this part from every seizing up again I'm going to apply some silicone grease to it this is suitable for use on possible water just in case so that has now got a good core single silicon V site we can now carefully screw that by towel when you do this you need to make sure that you do not get it cross threaded you can see that that is screwing in there very easily now we can simply take a suitable size spanner and then we can just tighten up that knot you don't need to go crazy when you're doing this it just needs to be tight it doesn't need to be really tight all you're doing is compressing the sealing ring at the bottom we can now refit the shroud you don't need any tool to do this at all simply put it on issue and it's not cross threaded and then just tighten that up by hand it's not a good idea to want to turn the water back on just to ensure with it you have done it correctly before you actually put the lever back on the top if not turn the water back on but I have only just cracked the stopped-up open just enough so that we can actually test it and you can see that the water is coming out to there and we have no leaks so that we know that that is not leaking anymore we can now go and open the stops up a little bit more I have now cleaned now to know using the square valve I'm always going to apply a little bit of grease to that part and then hopefully next time when it comes to service this it won't be quite difficult to do I'm also going to apply a bit of silicone grease to the club scoop and then we can start that in the lever before I put it back on so I can now push that back on American sizing up the grub screw now we'll test the top well the posse working first that way there's the call now alternatives take the Bluebird pods the chemists earlier push that back in the hold and then push the coil it indicator back in obviously the bag goes to the left unsay so that's how to change the cartridge and it's up like this it is normally very simple but you can come across a few problems which help demonstrated so that's been a useful video and if you haven't already please subscribe I want to give it a really good spear now with some severe punishments in the hope that it breaks the seal between the two components and I was going to leave that for about 15-20 minutes and they'll come back and I begorrah separating the two components and I'm just going to take it I'm going to drop it into some boiling hot water so we're just going to leave that in there a few minutes that might help to break the bond between the two components I wanted most of the water out I'm just going to pitch that out here global and we don't get burned can now grip the knots with some paper towel and successfully undo that before we pull you back we're just going to give them a clean so I'm just going to wait brush that", "Gwwzhzj-f-U": "hey guys there's dad connection we're going over fixing a very common seems to be a common Jeep NGO problem and first off Jeep NGO has a wycked atomizer and for that reason I am NOT a big fan of it but I still get it because there's a couple of brands particularly what I like is a body in mind they have a really great oil it's a boil very hard to find so I still get it but if you look if you if you google Jeep NGO breakdown you'll see our breakdown of it and you'll see why it's probably not the absolute best pod system but anyway common problem is you got your geo on lights up but there's just no smoke at all and what's causing this a lot of time is on the other side the pot is actually clogged so if you just had the pot like this you might notice it's a maybe the air show seems a little restricted sometimes it might not but really should suck on this other side like this and you notice there's no air flow well if there's no air flow coming from that side what's happening is the battery is activating but it's not actually going to the pods what's not doing anything and unfortunately you have to actually unfortunate doesn't worked out like when it does that so you just fix it and what I do is I just suck on this side now until it goes clear and then it'll work again let's see if it works you can kind of hear it probably clear out there we go see now it's clear that was kind of hard that was kind of hard to suck on and I could see it some people didn't really strong lungs that might be difficult to do but now let me suck that out put this back in mmm-hmm now it works so there you go very common fix we wouldn't keep NGOs not breaking pretty much suck the air on it on the opposite side out of that hole and then put it and then once that clears out probably all work thanks for watching guys is down connection have a great week", "_35hyQX03NE": "all right what's good y'all what's good y'all today i'm back

little [ __ ] is crazy bro but yeah that's the end of today's video i'll see you in the next one peace", "I_1Jk8g4QX4": "anyhow you guys doing I'm here to show you how to take a Logic Pro capsule and refill it you go from empty to full where you can use your own favorite Freight paper juice which one we use right here which is a fruit bomb this one's already this one I thought was the bad capsule at first I'm going to show you what to look forward to make sure they operate correctly first we're gonna do to refill it as you can see this one is empty oh and also my supplies are all cooking we'll just show you I'm using tweezers in case I need them syringe I use an 18 gauge needle 18 gauge about one inch and then of course your basic syringe and then a pic cuz I'm gonna show you what we're gonna use the pick for here in a few moments first thing first we're gonna get the capsule or maybe the middle top from the very end I'll sure remove the middle you're gonna see that there's a piece of plastic retainer I guess you could say and has your probes that leads to your positive and negative now if you notice really close in case you end up pulling this plastic out this is where I've came across where I messed up before I'm gonna pull it out for you just for demonstration because if you end up pulling out there's two different wires they go down into the your wake and they come back up one of them's got to touch this is where I have not seen any videos on this and that's why I'm just posting this video because one of these wires has to touch the outside of the canister right here pretty much ground it and then the other one comes up through how it was in the plastic retainer I'm going to show you how to refill it real quick and then more unlikely this needle might push it down so I'm gonna show you how to reset it and make sure you get it working correctly so I'm gonna get my needle stick it in if you can look down into the cartridge and go away from the both of the probes you're gonna go on the opposite side just take down into it and then you'll see where the needle will come out to the wick to the side now this thing has three different chambers so as you go to refill it you just push it in and it starts refilling on one side just let it roll over or it starts refilling evenly ain't kind of well anyways there's that opening on the top I just like to do this where I get even once I get it filled up pull it out and takes about one and a half emails to fill one of these up perfectly from honest empty and I've also noticed you don't want to fully empty how to capsule before you refill it cuz it will dry the wick out so now we got to put this back in we will slide the wire in through it now for some reason if for you push that wire it down but that's why I have these pics here for because basically you can then get the pic slowly pull the wire up to where you can get the tweezers and get it exposed as long as it's exposed still we will slide that in on the one corner if we can see here fly that in keeping the other one on the middle rim push it down that's where I probably use a tweezers one more time so you want to pull this up so I can overhang so I can get a good contact with where it's gonna connect to the battery but the other piece back in see that's where I was pulling down that's why it's really best if you refill it without taking this plastic off but for some reason like I said if it does come out this is why I'm showing this video and that's where you still have it exposed push it down and now we're in business my five clicks and there you have it enjoy", "I9babjQA-aM": "whether you got an exotic car or a tank art I'm going to show you how to get the oil up so this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got an exciting one for you today all right so a lot of you have asked me how can I get the oil out of my broken cartridge well if you've got an exotic card or a dead bank card or one of the many other cartridges that use this style of vaporizer cartridge I'm going to show you how to get the oil out of it first things first let's take it to the deck and introduce you to what we'll be working with all right so here we are first things first let me go over the utensils that we will be working with today this is a stand that I made myself to hold cartridges in while I filled in these are a couple of varieties of syringe that are available this particular style right here works adequately for filling and emptying most cartridges that you get on the market today specifically 1/2 gram cartridges and 1 gram cartridges this will generally empty most of those now this tip is a little short and as such I'm showing a few of the available sizes this is approximately 1/2 inch one inch and a one and a half inch tips right here in varying diameters for filling no next to it I have a 1/2 gram or 0.5 milliliter and a 1 gram or a 1 milliliter cartridge these are one-time use non reusable disposable cartridges these are also 0.5 milliliter or 1/2 gram and one milliliter or 1 gram these are refillable and reusable the mouthpiece screws off where these are a press fit and they have to be forcibly removed now these are the two styles that I recommend when you are replacing the oil into another cartridge as you will see the exotic cards uses a slightly different cartridge right there but I prefer when I'm refilling to go with a tried-and-true cartridge to ensure the failure does not happen again with that in mind the first thing we're going to look at is these tips now as you can see this is a one and a half inch tip right here this is an half inch tip right here no this is a half milliliter or 1/2 gram cartridge as you can see this tip would work adequately to recover just about all the oil in that cartridge very well in the 1 gram cartridge as you can see you would be able to recover most of the oil except for what is stuck around the chimney right there for that a longer syringe such as this is a much more adequate okay now that I've shown you a couple of the utensils let's get these cartridges open real quick and we can see what they look like all right here we are so this is a lemon berry Gang babes cartridge with a C cell with a pronounced THC of 90.9 9% here's a little bit of a close-up if you'd like to pause that to get a little bit of the idea of the flavor then this is a C cell cartridge right here just like it states C cell right there this one right here this I believe is an eye crusher cartridge and this is some fruity pebbles from exotic cars this has the hologram I'm right there and this is a hybrid this one here says it's been 80 and 85 all right okay and here we are now please bear with me this may take a minute for some of these I have found that on some of these cartridges this perfectly round tip right here does not always work and I have modified one slightly so that it is slightly oblong to fit down around that chimney a little bit and that's what I want to be using right now to ensure that I'm able to reach cover as much oil as I can I'll be working with this first one this is a fruity pebbles from exotic karts I believe this is an eye crusher cartridge what we're gonna do we're going to start off with just removing the lid it just twists off just like that right there you can see set that to the side now I have a custom-made stand right here that I tend to use to hold my cartridges when I'm filling them if it tends to stay pretty pretty good right there right and you're going to take your syringe and just insert it and start drawing up right as you can sort of these have both been warmed up a little bit to ensure that they do flow decently I definitely recommend that as you can see you want to try to get as far down into that that edge right near that hole right there as you can get and then lean that the cartridge as far away as you can and just try to recover every little bit that you can and don't don't be afraid to suck a little bit of air up in there I mean you really want to you want to be able to try to recover everything that you can there for sure all right there's a little bit there what I recommend you do at that stage is just set it on the side and let it gather on one on one side real quick heat that up a little bit let all that oil gather on that opposite side and then you can stick this back in there and and utilize it that way well this is warm I'm gonna put this into another cartridge real quick just to ensure that it flows pretty good like I said then just put this tip right down in there this is able to go actually down in there like this to recover oil from one of these are necessary and then all right there you go sit that put Leon that and remember this let these sit for a few minutes that then oil bubble down in his holes and if it's good and warm like this one is it'll get down to those holes no problem alright and that's basically how you do that one as you can see on this there's a little bit gathering down on that edge we'll just gather that up as much as we can right there and uh this here just set it right off to the side with the cap there and uh that's basically garbage now with the dank veins it's a little bit of a different different different ballgame here you've got to remove this mouthpiece this mouthpiece is a press fit on here it does not just come off so what you're gonna need to do you're gonna need to grab this with a pair of vise grips or a comparable pair of pliers and there you go alright pull that mouthpiece right off of there now we take our syringe we insert our syringe all the way down and get just down there see how far that went in and then we slowly start to draw that all out of there all right we want to put the syringe on the bottom edge and start drawing there we go he's just taking all that oil right out of there all the way down until there's almost nothing left in there she'll be able to empty that thing out completely alright and there you go that's basically one done unit that point you can get comparable unit exactly basically the same unit brand-new these cartridges can all be purchased at vape art smart comm there is a link in the description you simply take that cartridge you take that syringe you put it right in there just like you four set it right down near that inside down there just like that there's a fill up in there all right and there you go put the lid on that get that near the old vise press that in and WHAM bulb Lambo there you go let's get this back on top and I'll tell you guys how this works out alright folks well here we are back on top with the new cartridges we got the fruity pebbles crammed down into this bad chicken right here this is a refillable csail cartridge available in the description below at Bay Park smart dog on go ahead give them a click and I'll go check that out the syringes that I use also available at Bay Park smart dog but go down there give up click on that link in the description and go check them out we've got the lemon berry from dad baby sitting here on another non refillable press-fit sea cell cartridge those are also available at vape arts marcom click that link in the description if you're interested in those all right well let's strap this on this old battery and see what see what she is Susie it's like Shelly all right yeah yeah that's what I'm talking about all right well there you go you guys have an absolutely wonderful they think is so much for to me and I started to appreciate it if you learned something and you enjoyed it but like on the old thumbs up down there make sure you share this so other people can also benefit from the knowledge and you have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with CMC connoisseurs peace", "ueWlzauc9VY": "this Delta Hal 2 video will show you how to flush the lines on your Delta kitchen faucet to complete this project you'll need channel lock pliers a screwdriver a cloth a towel an eighth inch allen wrench an adjustable wrench a bucket or mixing bowl and perhaps white vinegar also an extra set of hands does your Delta kitchen faucet make noise whenever you turn it off and on well the most likely culprit is some debris that's become trapped either in the supply lines or inside the faucet itself however you can clear it with a simple procedure called flushing the lines to get started check the aerator first unscrew the aerator that's located at the end of the spout make sure to also remove the gasket which sometimes sticks to the end of the spout the aerator should unscrew counterclockwise by hand but if you're having difficulty wrap a cloth around it and use a pair of channel locks to gently loosen it be careful not to squeeze it too hard and bend it if that doesn't work you can try a vinegar soaked rag wrapped around and over the aerator to help loosen it just give it some time to soak in check the aerator for any debris and then go ahead and shut off the supply valves under the sink now turn the faucet handle on to completely drain the lines alright with the aerator removed and the faucet handle in the on position go ahead and turn the water supply back on the sudden burst of water may remove the debris that's become stuck inside if it's still making noise the debris may be trapped inside the faucet itself turn off the water supply and drain the lines just as you did before now you'll need a few tools for this part of the process an allen wrench probably a pinch a screwdriver some towels and a bucket or Bowl start by removing the screw cover under the handle use an allen wrench to loosen the small hex screw and take off the handle then remove the bonnet nut and bonnet cap now remove the spout grasp the round metal stem and pull out the ball along with the cam and packing you will need to reinstall these later so be sure to note how they were position in the valve in the front of the brass valve body you will see a diverter for the side sprayer using the screwdriver remove the diverter and check that there is no debris next you will want to check the rest of the valve you'll see what are called the seats and springs insert the allen wrench or ball stem into the rubber seat tilt it back slightly to catch the spring and lift them both out once you have the valve completely disassembled place a bucket or bowl upside down over the entire valve assembly then place a rolled up towel behind the faucet and this might be a good time to ask for help from an extra pair of hands one person should hold the bucket over the valve assembly and the other should turn the water back on this will help to keep the bucket in place as the water is turned back on turn both water supplies back on full strength the water will come directly out of the empty valve body and be diverted back into the sink by the bucket and this should clear any remaining debris from the lines turn the water off and reassemble the faucet making sure there's no debris stuck to any of the parts tighten everything securely and turn the water back on if you have a to handle faucet the process is slightly different you will need to remove the handle spout and diverter note that in a to handle faucet the diverter will be down in the bottom middle of the valve body instead of to the side the diverter can be unscrewed using a large screwdriver or coin keeping the handles in place lay a rolled-up towel behind the faucet and place a bucket or bowl upside down over the entire valve assembly again this might be a good time to ask for help from an extra pair of hands one person should hold the bucket over the valve assembly and the other should turn the water back on this will help keep the bucket in place as the waters turn back on turn both water supplies back on full strength the water will come directly out of the empty valve body and be diverted back into the sink by the bucket this should clear any remaining debris in the lines if that does not solve the problem you'll have to disassemble the hot and cold valves as well repeat the entire disassembly process until you get to flushing the lines at this point washing the lines disassemble the hot and cold valves remove each of the handles and use an adjustable wrench to unscrew the bonnet nuts now take off the bonnet then reach in and grab the stem that the handle was attached to and pull it straight up with the stems removed take out the seats and springs from both sides once you have the valves completely disassembled repeat the process of flushing aligns with a bucket over the entire faucet and a rolled-up towel behind turn the water off and reassemble the faucet making sure there's no debris stuck to any of the parts tighten everything securely and turn the water back on so now that you flush the lines your newly repaired faucet should work smoothly and quietly you", "v_kGhayeHbQ": "hey everyone i uh thought i'd start a little video here i'm i'm constantly uh going on to youtube and trying to figure out how to repair things around my house and i figured you know what i'm always doing this stuff maybe i should uh video one myself anyway uh this would be for my neighbors that have the same home as me but uh right today what we're doing is we're just replacing the cartridge for a delta bathtub faucet um this is the new product that i went down to home depot and purchased for this particular uh faucet yours may be a little different but uh always take your old one out and take it down there and they'll they'll match it up with how it looks but this is for a delta faucet this particular install so what we're going to do here i'm going to adjust the camera here and uh so we had the problem here was that uh we were leaking all around here and it was leaking out the faucet and dripping all night long and i'd seen this done before so i uh i figured i could do it for cheap so both these uh both of these uh cartridges cost me 18 so that's a lot better than having to buy a whole new faucet handle combination or call a plumber in here most of this stuff you can do if you're like me and we just figure it out and go on to youtube and um yeah and save some money so what i'm doing here is i'm just popping out this plastic part and a little screwdriver you get it out like that and underneath is a screw and the screw will release the handle now these are really rusted so i'm gonna give a little muscle there monkey grease as they like to say and get this screw out of here a little screw pulls down the handle of course before you do any of this you want to turn your water off to your house one very important uh aspect of the job now these can be a little stuck because they've been on there a while but it will just pop pop up with a little so as you can see in here water is just kind of dripping around just coming out on its own there because all the rubber seals and everything of worn out over time so at this point what we got to do is get there's a nut on the top of this guy i do have the water alpha oh this one's completely trashed it's trashed okay so there's a nut right here on the top that you can it shouldn't be too tight this one's really bad it just kind of slips off here like that that's the nut and it holds down uh the cartridge that's in there currently now at this point the cartridge should just come straight up however um you know it's going to be in there a little bit so we need to uh just kind of pull straight up wiggle it around a little bit there we go and the water just flows out okay so that's the cartridge the old cartridge it's gonna have a little rubber washer here and uh that's all probably old and no good this is whole thing is no good but again this is like nine bucks at home depot okay versus hundreds or thousands of dollars for a plumber to come in here and fix this for you okay so inside there we have a um a washer and a little spring there's just sitting down in there okay and here's what they look like and this is how they they sit on top of each other so you've got the washer and underneath the spring okay and it just sits right on top okay and the spring tension just kind of keeps it butted up against the bottom of right here which keeps the water from flowing so then when you turn it the opening is right there you turn it like that see pretty ingenious okay so that's all shot and what we're going to do is kind of clean up around here a little bit open up our new one at first when i watched my video they didn't really explain how the spring and the washer went in there and i mean it's self-explanatory i guess when you kind of look at it but basically the spring goes in first and then the washer sits on top now there's a little hole down inside here that they go into and with the water in there it kind of makes it hard to get them to go in there you just kind of carefully use your needle nose pliers and just drop it down in there now it's not going to go right in there because of all the water the the spring will go but the washer will float around so you got to kind of use your fingers and get it on there as best you can what i had to do was just kind of kind of push it down around the spring it is supposed to go around the spring but inside the hole it finally kind of pops in there but it's a little it's a little tricky because the hole is a little small we don't want to damage the the washer so if you're going in crooked that that'll be the issue yeah this is giving me some trouble the other one went a little easier of course it's the one i'm doing the video on i think the last time i got more of the water out of here now the thing flipped upside down because it does go it goes a certain way the thinner part goes around the spring and it keeps floating around on me there it is i got it you little use a little force on it and then when you're able to push it up and down you'll feel the spring pushing on it but it should go in there even and i can feel the spring pushing there we go that's the hardest part of the install right there just takes a little patience and you will get it so take your new one here and remember which way it goes which i forgot to look honestly when i pulled this out but it will line up obviously the flat part here goes uh because we're we're in the closed position on top of the washer so you can kind of see that right there and there's a couple little notches right there you'll see the notches let me show those to you it's going to be kind of hard to do but there's a notch right there see that see how the water's just flowing here so i think that i might have another issue another issue here there's probably more parts of the valve down in there i'm not sure but um this would fix my immediate problem once i get it all together but look the water's just flowing well the water is off at on the house side so somehow water is still coming through here so i'm assuming but i don't know but i'm assuming that more of this taken out there's probably another washer deeper down in there or something i don't know i'm not sure honestly that's a total gas i don't know there's probably not a washer because this is the valve but i don't know why the water is still pouring through here that might mean that my main water supply valve it leaks a little bit i'm not sure okay so now we take our very corroded bolt here goes right over the top and screws down over the top of our new valve and once you tighten this up that's going to seal everything we're just going to give it a little bit of a little turn here it doesn't have to be root strength you just want to get it snug i'm blocking the camera and this is my first youtube video so there you go hey but i was smart enough to get a tripod okay so we tighten this up here i know this video is lengthy but i think detail i appreciate the videos myself when people actually talk i've seen some videos where people just play music over what they're doing and that does not help me i need the person to slowly explain to me what's going on that's what i'm trying to do here okay so we got all that in there we got our handle there's a notch in here it's gonna just find the sweet spot here oh i think it goes this way nope there we go oh okay there's a flat side to the there's a flat side on here but the problem i'm having wait a minute okay that's working there we go okay that's good that's right on there put your screw back in tighten it up and you've just replaced a delta cartridge and that eighteen dollars is a lot better than having to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a plumber to come out here and fix your delta cartridge that's it right there okay brand new all right i hope that helped and uh maybe i'll do some more videos but it's my first youtube video and um good luck", "TZF31-WO5Eg": "hi so recently we had a faucet go bad on us it was a Moen we went and replaced with a new Moen and after we got it installed we found out that the water pressure pretty pretty low especially compared to the old one after doing some internet research I determined that the old one was 2.2 gallons per minute of water flow and the new ones are only 1.5 so that's pretty significant considering how low the water pressure is to begin with so I was about to take it apart and return it and I decided to see if I couldn't fix the issue the one I bought was this Moen Banbury eight seven zero one seven SRS I don't know if this will hold true for every Moen faucet or Kohler or other brands but it works for this one so what you need to do pull out your faucet handle and you will see right here it connects to this pipe through the photos you can unscrew it you don't really need to have too much it's this is a plastic part you don't want to screw it on too tight and what when we pull this off make sure it doesn't slide down I had that problem recently and it was kinda but so this is what you see on the inside you will see a rubber gasket which will come off and then inside of that is a reducer underneath that you take that out and what you have left is a valve that prevents it from back flowing which you won't leave in there and if you can see that reduces it to that flow of those three little holes which is not really enough to do your dishes and then all you have to do is screw it back together and you just want to probably go a little bit harder than hand-tight on this again you don't want to crack that plastic much improve the water flow", "97dzlqMq9u4": "welcome to another episode of stay high stay humble podcast you support on let's go man back with another review today I'll be reviewing the fat cause either starburst now the starburst is a strain we mix it between the DJ's shorts blueberry and headbang says that it is a hybrid so yeah and I will be reviewing a new battery I have that's called the be mine so basically just a battery for any 510 thread cart it's like I said I'll be reviewing the fat cloud Z so just like any other battery click it five times to turn it on and off five and now us off you see and then you click five times and turn it on one two three four five that's what it does then you know two three clicks to change the [ __ ] I'm going to see the green is the lowest setting on their yellow is a middle setting and red is the third setting so that's the study that I use to keep it on usually keep it on the highest setting when it comes to any battery that I'm using and when I'm vaping the carts so like I said I believe reviewing the starburst so basically I already took a couple of hits before I start the video and something you may be able to tell but I'm pretty pretty high this is the shrub the starburst range I think it's called the pink starburst Oh so they said it's a hybrid definitely definitely do get that sweet taste you also get up Heine taste more so sweet yeah with the new fat clouds carts they have like an adjuster on their so basically you control the airflow so right now I got it turn it's like it's shown three circles and if you keep turning it you know the circles go away so use the if is showing no circles that's like the hardest pool and I like it you know set that way with like you know the hardest pool cuz on a more open setting went through circles Sean it was like I had a smoother airflow but the hips wasn't as strong you know I didn't really need you know was a coffin as much so if you don't you know want coffee as much and you don't you know you want to either airflow I would put it on that setting but I prefer the setting where it's like showing those circles and stronger airflow something let me see preheat it and take a hit definitely definitely hits this tastes great high is great any kartli I usually bake for fat cloudy as always you know tasting great or it tastes like that strain of weed and highest consistent you know each time you you know you're vaping it because you know with other carts it may be like you know weaker high and high don't last as long but look fat cloudy I say it last ones like iron it has the two hours and all it takes is a couple hits you know one or two hits here good so yeah it's definitely definitely uh Phil Annette and I definitely like the battery it shows you how much how much all you have left even though it's you know sticking out at the top I wish it was like a little bit taller so it cover more of the cart but you know definitely definitely like and I definitely like the design of it put it right in your pockets whether you're headed to the movies they add to the grocery store local corner store don't matter you know you can take it with you as discreet take a couple of hits it's not gonna smell like anything it's nothing I like about you know the carts yeah yeah definitely definitely liking this train to me feels more of an indica I know it's like a hybrid mix between the sativa and indica but it definitely definitely feel like that little more of an indica body high not much as a head high but definitely definitely a body high it feels great it definitely definitely like this battery uh and I definitely like the carp more verses like the older carts I'm going to take out another one show you the difference so this is like the order cart and this is a newer car so you kind of you know see the difference take the bottom piece off of this one and you can definitely you know tell you know the difference between the two we are definitely like that she can control the airflow and a newer one versus the older one is just you know a regular cart most people didn't like that it was like always a harder pool so I would definitely definitely you know say if you have a tri-five cloudy yet definitely pick them up and you know if you have tried them definitely you would definitely enjoy like the newer cart better and there's you know better design better air flow that you control so yeah yeah that's my review of the starburst with black clouds even if you enjoyed the video give me a thumbs up man if you want to see more definitely subscribe stay tuned and remember stay high stay humble these", "hS5h4wzp6Jc": "how's it going you guys welcome back to beyond skylines and I got a review for you today to know

letters stick on you know it's like the same thing as the krt to make sure the packaging gets sticked onto the label of the box you know you'll see that but you open it up as you can see it is

so here is a picture of the cart actually let me move my something I might appear because it's making that look weird so that's what it looks like and I'm gonna go ahead put on the Clark so this is what its gonna look like this would be a picture that's a thumbnail and this is a different type of cart so I'm gonna go ahead take it off put it over here and I'll go ahead and open up this cartridge I opened up the wrong side give me a scientist of course I did so before i opening industrial box oh whatever that's it so I'm going to go ahead and open the box so I have to take it out like that and you're gonna have this at the bottom so just thinking off I'm gonna go ahead and put this on my other cart put this in almost dropped it and there we go I don't see any bubbles at all on this list is like completely for I'm gonna go ahead turn it on and give it a preheat so let it preheat for a little bit just so the coil soaks it up and all that okay and they're gonna go ahead and give it a hit jeez my fan is off and it's right there but I think my my a/c is still on so it's kind of annoying and you'll see if I can go ahead and turn that off so it says I just turned it off hopefully it did I'll try to hit it again but it tastes like like strawberries it does taste pretty good so pink runs for some reason when I'm in my car I do ghosts the best that's weird that was okay it was okay so I'm gonna go ahead read what it says best bio 1:7 2020 THC eighty-eight point twenty five percent THC five point eighty milligrams serving CBD zero and that's pretty much it and then it just says like the governmental warning now I bet have to come it's gonna be like oh it's fake it's week I don't like here tastes pretty good dang there's only like two bubbles and they're like super super small that's it often those all those hits like two bubbles on my car - it was fun I got hella good OHS and here I can't get good OHS I type a - getting from here pretty good it is just a teba so to keep me up I'm not gonna be going to sleep anytime soon I hope so it's my first time hitting it actually it's my second time hitting it because I hit my friends before but I only had to like once take that off put back the other one yeah so the bubbles are really small you can't really even see the balls so I do like these carts I'll put it back have it later OOP wrong clip wrong port and there you go try back my other cart this one doesn't really have as much as a flavor but this one gets me so I like this one I like this one you will hit that so from now on guys I don't know if you guys have noticed I've been doing a little bit editing but for now until I see more subs and stuff like that I'm gonna start doing just the video so the so I can get more uploads going out for you guys so it kind of evens out because when I had it done you get one like maybe a once a week or two every week I'll try to do like for every week analysis all there's gonna be like a tiny bit less editing because I barely added them as it is I'm just gonna upload them to keep doing uploads so let me know what you guys think of that I think that won't be better so I think that's watching this Ethan signing out peace", "H8F4jv9HOdM": "what's good YouTube it is your girl Cebu Productions coming to you today with a video on how to refill your own C cell darked moxie or delta pogs with your own eliquid instead of having to continue purchasing these $50 pods each I haven't found a video on YouTube that covers this because of the little difficulty involved in doing it but I'm going to show you how I ended up doing mine what worked for me and for those who are not for the faint of heart who want to give it a try this is your method so stay tuned so when you get your Delta pot generally it comes like this with your pod insert it inside of it and on the sides here you'll see that I can get this camera to focus that it has like the little clips in play this here that holds the cartridge in the trick is to break off these little ends here by using some type of tool I use like some little tweezers on my end to break this little piece here off on both sides and in doing so that allowed me to be able to create what looks like this so you can get that to focus so if you can see there those two sides have been broken off making it possible for me to be able to remove the inside pod that's inside full of my juice so what I'll do is take my little tweezers here now that those sides have been removed and just pull on it and voila you have your oil cartridge so at this point all you need to do is just remove your top fill it with your favorite liquid which in my case I use the koi pink lemonade since I love me some pink lemonade our real I refilled my cartridge here then taking my new cartridge cap that's been modified just so you can see it again stick it back on here DDD close it down [Music] place my pod neatly back into its casing and have a rip and there you go my lovely ones that is how you successfully do it hope this video helps someone take care", "hVfG8AKlZvE": "wwg booze vape supplies calm here talking about the ohm meter which measures the voltage of the vape batteries as well as the cartridges today we are going to go over the voltage of the 350 and may H battery it's a variable voltage battery allows you to basically change the voltage three different temperatures comes out of this packaging here and as you'll see so we're going to hook that up to our o meter and see exactly how many volts it produces on the lowest setting the lowest setting here is green so two point five nine two point about two point six volts on the green now we're going to just switch it over to the next temperature setting blue it's the medium temperature now we're at 3.3 volts three point three six and we're going to go to the last temperature which is the hottest red and four point zero four volts so as you can see ranges from two point six to about four volts giving you a little bit of options again you can buy both the batteries and the ohm meter is off our website at cheapest vape supplies calm or feel free to give us a call ask us any
