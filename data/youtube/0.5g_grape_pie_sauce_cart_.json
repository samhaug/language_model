{"EYIHS2iJ3V8": "[Music] [Music] so good morning everyone good morning good morning hey welcome all you new folks and welcome back everybody it is just get up and move october for us you guys hey a whole bunch of people on facebook are walking and they're exercising and that's awesome i'll come back to comment you guys because i want to congratulate some of you for some of your efforts that you're doing i lifted my weights last night did my arms i did i walked on the treadmill a little bit it's funny because my fitbit if you're not like moving your arms i have to set it to run and exercise even when i'm like pushing a cart because it doesn't track it and like over the weekend we went to walmart we walked all around and looked at all the halloween stuff and we went to may season you know we went all over and then i looked at how much i walked and it's like hardly showed anything and i know i walked so um i have to remember to do that i did that last night on the treadmill too and that gave me better mileage more bang for my buck showed more steps made me feel better and all the good stuff anyway you guys everything that you eat all the medicine you take your stress level lack of sleep or a great night's sleep can have a direct effect on water retention water weight gain for instance harry has been having uh issues with gout and he had to take another gap pill yesterday so um and he couldn't put his shoes on his feet were swollen he hurt you know he's slumping around didn't have a good night's sleep so with that that has a direct effect on your weight so let me show you with your weight before i go over what we had to eat yesterday i went down one and two tenths point i'm still up from my all-time low down but i went down you guys my colitis is healing i had a really good night's sleep um harry went up a pound and i know that's because he had to take a gout pill well i had some pork orange too but what okay uh yeah i had some pork rinds wendy okay okay but when you have pork rinds you need to write them here harry's i put him over there he put it on his board but not on my board so anyway you guys yesterday what did we have to eat besides pork rinds i had four eggs cooked in two tablespoons of butter with alternate ketchup and i repeated i had four eggs butter alternate ketchup i drank my uh collagen one scoop in my coffee in the morning with three tablespoons of khalifa pumpkin spice and i had a scoop after dinner with the other three tablespoons of khalifa pumpkin spice i had a total of three percent carbs for a total of 9.4 grams 72 fat for a total of 89.1 grams i had 25 protein for a total of 68.5 grams and i had a total of 1096 calories harry had pork rinds last night plus three eggs and five ounces of ground beef had a lovely beef bowl with a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of beef tallow for dinner he had three eggs in five ounces of ground beef with one tablespoon of butter he had two scoops of collagen one in the morning one in the evening and again he had six tablespoons of khalifa total with the pumpkin spice we i have another order out to vitacosta it should come today because we're almost out of pumpkin spice gotta have it he had one percent carbs for a total of 4.8 grams 65 for a total of 115.9 grams 34 protein for a total of 133.8 grams which is just right at his lean body mass limit and his total calories were 1608. so with that mr pork bandit harry let me have you take me to the big board so i had the pork rinds last night because i did say i took the gal pill you know hurt pretty bad and uh don't like taking stuff on an empty stomach so i didn't take that much maybe an ounce two ounces but every time i use pork rinds it still makes my weight go up and so does the gout kill so we found out i went up a pound put up a pound on when we just eat sorry i almost fell into the board i'm sorry i'm sorry um because we we ate basically i should have went down on that no problem at all but because of the gout pill and probably the pork rinds because i think i had about maybe about two hours not two ounces a serving is half an ounce oh that would have been an ounce that'd be an ounce then and uh we went up wendy went wendy did great she went down you know so but i went up and it's got to be the gal pill and probably the two together didn't help but every time he pork rinds the salt that's in there always causes me to gain weight and we're finding out that the gout pills will also somebody else brought that up too what about the pork rind oh the gout pill yeah somebody brought that up that you will gain water weed yeah i can't remember who it was but uh sorry about that but i can't remember what it was anyways that's really about all i got to report well so what do you think about should you continue to have hamburger do you oh no i think i should change over to chicken for all because you know it could be that that's causing me to get the heartburn too yeah and because i'm eating too much of because all i've been eating is hamburger right hamburger and eggs maybe we need to change it up you think we should get a rotisserie chicken tonight and get some chicken to cook for the week for next time this morning because all i got is hamburger hamburger and i got bacon in the wings and we've got eggs and you say just eating eggs don't do it for you i don't know i would just ate eggs so let's see what happens i'll eat some eggs this morning i can make us i can make us some pumpkin protein truffles oh that'd be a good idea and just eggs and not have any ground beef i'm just trying to i'm because i'm just trying to think of what we can do you know i'm just trying to think of what we can do that will help with the gout and i think the meat part might could be an issue it could be inflaming it you know what i mean that's what i'm thinking too because i've noticed the last couple days when i swallow right it i'm talking about i'm talking about the hamburger here i get a burning at the top of my stomach so what i'm gonna do you guys is we're cutting the eggs bacon and beef uh challenge that we had off today um i think it's a day early because today's monday but it's because of harry and we are going to have the pumpkin protein choppels which are made just with eggs and a scoop of biotrust protein and then a little bit of syrup on it yeah that's a good idea so i think that's what we should and maybe some eggs with that on the side just yeah because eggs for me are um yeah it's easy on the stomach easy on the stomach and see how you do yeah did you i also cut out coffee yeah i've cut out the coffee today too and the bubbly drinks you had a bang i had a bang though but but no bubbly drinks because bang doesn't without but for the rest of the day for the rest of the day i'm not going to have any like uh soda water water yeah just regular water that's really about it and then we'll have chicken for dinner yeah okay so you guys come back when i have to go raid my cupboard and get everything and figure everything out for our protein truffles and i've got to figure out today's menu based on that and based on rotisserie chicken so we'll come back in the next segment i'll have all that put together for everybody right yeah okay okay guys sorry okay you guys i made today's menu and this is a little experiment i'm gonna make my homemade protein truffles okay i'm gonna make a batch for myself and a batch for harry one batch is gonna be three eggs a scoop of the biotrust protein powder half of a tablespoon of khalifa or one tablespoon of khalifa excuse me one tablespoon of butter for dinner we're buying a rotisserie chicken harry's having the two chicken breasts off of it basically he likes the white meat he's gonna have two tablespoons of avocado mayo and a tablespoon of mustard and i make a mustard aioli for him and then he gets two scoops of collagen because he's not having coffee what we're going to do is we're going to mix the collagen in uh ultima and see if it makes a difference in the taste or how it works so we'll let you guys know on that ultima for those of you who are new is an electrolyte drink and it's zero calories anyway i'm having the chicken thighs in one of the legs a tablespoon of avocado mayo and a tablespoon of mustard to make my mustard dip i'm having two scoops of collagen and four tablespoons of the khalifa toasted coconut almond milk throughout the day so my carbs are going to be two percent i'm going to have 8.3 grams total only 55 fat for a total of 81.2 grams 43 protein look at my protein how high it is you guys 142.5 grams that's because we have high protein powder and eggs in our truffles so that's higher than my lean body mass so let's see how i do on that i mean body mass is 120 so my total calories are going to be 1366. harry's gonna have two percent carbs for a total of 7.9 grams 53 fat for a total of 92.3 grams 45 protein for a total of 179.1 grams total calories are going to be 1622. so this is high his lean body mass is 133 and his protein is going to be 179.1 that's because he's been having stomach issues i don't want to put more fat down there and chickens pretty mild so that's my best guesstimate using rotisserie chicken as a choice in my fitbit and we'll see how we do tomorrow but every time we've had rotisserie chicken it's been higher in protein and it hasn't bothered us like it does with steak or with beef when we eat high beef protein i don't know if there's a difference between the chicken and the beef but it seems like we can get away with eating more chicken and have higher protein levels than we can when we eat beef if you notice that yeah i know it's i can't figure out i can't figure that out i can't either but we'll see how this works this is going to be easy on his stomach so far no gout pill correct right and we're not eating pork rinds correct if you need to eat something i'll save some rotisserie chicken so you can eat that with a pill okay okay everybody i'm making us each an entire batch so that would be uh four truffles in my cuisinart okay so each batch consists of three eggs one tablespoon of khalifa toasted coconut almond milk or cream or the um milk replacement of your choice that you use one teaspoon of jordan's skinny syrup pumpkin cheesecake six drops of vanilla french vanilla better stevia you can use your own sweetener and put a little bit of vanilla in this if you don't have this i'm gonna put a little bit of pumpkin pie spice just sprinkle some in and i'm gonna use one scoop of my pumpkin spice protein powder and if whatever flavor protein powder you have whatever is your best perfect keto you know high key whatever is your favorite um keto high protein powder give that a try but this is what i'm using and i'm going to double this batch because it's going to be a batch for harry and a batch for myself so let's get started you guys yeah because uh two batches of six yes get my whipper i'm gonna use my jordan skinny syrup i'm going to put two teaspoons in because this again is a double batch let me use this oops oh that i think that was gonna taste good oh yeah seriously i'ma like those oops khalifa two tablespoons we use these these measuring for breakfast for our coffee too so i don't have my uh pumpkin spice creamer yet from vitacost i'm waiting for it patiently so it's not going to be as pumpkin spicy so a little bit oh excuse me french vanilla better stevia six drops and by adding two different this is with sucralose and this is stevia by blending the two oh and i also bubbling it mellows out the sweet and taste it blends it so i put two pinches of salt in i'm going to stir this up really good because when i put the protein powder in it'll clump a little bit i just want to incorporate the flavors all the liquids first one two this will give us the protein and the eggs um let me stir this up real quick this makes it more of the consistency of waffle or pancake powder too i'm gonna let that sit just a second but so for this your protein you guys is 24 grams for two scoops and two point five percent fat so uh carbs is seven grams of three dietary fiber so let me look at what this has this has inulin in it as well and it is sweetened with stevia and the trick is when you make a double batch don't overfill because you've got more um batter do just like you would if you didn't have the extra batter so that for me i use the same scoop that would be a tablespoon one of these big scoops in each one then i take like a half and drizzle just a little bit into each one it doesn't always fill up all the holes and let that cook you guys we'll come back when it is pumpkin spice protein truffles oh look how pretty those are they're all for harry too it's my badge that's your batch all right you guys when you cook them with the protein powder it is so um satisfying it tastes just like a regular waffle harry gets a tablespoon of butter i melted some butter truffles syrup this is molden farms regular syrup regular walden syrup it is done with sucralose but here's what harry's having for breakfast you guys yum and i got mine with pumpkin spice seasoning on it too anyway you guys gotta eat now you're so good you guys i don't have much room on my desk to to eat but oh my gosh [Music] hmm pumpkin spice coffee too how they taste like pumpkin spice i miss my coffee i miss my coffee dude yeah looks good it is isn't that pretty yep focus pocus really pretty yep gotta eat now gotta eat them while they're warm or freeze them and reheat them in the toaster we're gonna mix a scoop of this grape grape oh i can't talk great ultima replenisher and if you look at this it's completely zero so it's not worth even tracking because there's no carbs no protein no calories and no fat and these are the ingredients so i'm going to mix in one of these drinks with some of the protein powder and see how it goes here because you got to get your pro you got to get your collagen in i said protein powder i apologize we're going to mix it with biotrust protein right for those of you who don't drink hot tea or hot coffee you need to get your protein i mean excuse me i keep saying that you need to get your collagen in get the unflavored collagen and mix it with something if you take your electrolytes mix it with that you can mix it in water it really doesn't have any flavor but i'm going to mix some and see how it does hope it doesn't explode because this is a little is it self-refessive a little bit so let's see you guys i need a cup a big cup of yours harry okay you guys so i have about half of a cup if you come here that's 20 ounces i'm going to give harry a nice big scoop of this ultima nice big scoop and i'm going to stir this because in cold water it doesn't it doesn't uh takes a while for it to break down this is what's going to be a hard time no i think it'll be okay it says cold or hot okay so that's the ultima and this is a science experiment biotrust one scoop in you go so far so good someone asked me what do i mix my uh unflavored collagen with well i would say right now it's going to be ultima smells smells like cooling what does it look like foamy yeah is that too foamy to drink or do you think you can take a taste tastes fun that's like a drink what grape yeah so you can't taste any of that collagen there's no funky weirdness to it it just tastes like your regular huh let me see inside just a little bit different but not much okay let's put some ice cubes in it so that's a win you guys you guys can use your unflavored collagen ultima and you can use your uh unflavored biotrust with it you guys so that's a win huh hairy yep okay you guys we just got back from walmart all of my glasses were wrong my computer glasses were perfect for reading not computer my left side changed from when she checked it a week ago totally all my glasses are being redone and i can't find my regular glasses so these are this is what i found five pairs of glasses you guys like the national debt anyway wendy's ranting i am planting we got chickens i got two because i want chicken today and tomorrow oops today and tomorrow i was trying to read like the carbs on this and added sugars don't tip it yeah anyway this is the traditional walmart i got a bag of romaine i'm not i didn't track it for today so i'll have a salad tomorrow i got parmesan cheese and salad for tomorrow's leftover cold chicken so we are just going to have pardon me where'd you go throwing bags around anyway you guys we're having chicken here he's having the white breast so i'm having legs and thighs and we'll weigh it with the bone in and then we'll weigh it afterwards and i'll fix my board but my board says harry gets two chicken breasts and i get two chicken thighs and a chicken leg yeah so the challenge with that is you choose rotisserie chicken you don't know really how big it is i'd rather weigh it so i'm weighing the chicken legs here i took two what bones in it's 10.79 i'll come back and weigh the bones i put i weighed harry's his was 9.88 so i got no bones he's got no bones no bones about breasts yep so but what i do get is i get some um zero this out because we get mayonnaise let me count the ways let's wave this puppy oh you can't yes i can i'm going to zero it out because i'm just waiting don't listen to me i'm not i'm not i just figured out what you were doing oh good i'm glad you were figuring that all out i mean 14 i need 14 15. perfect so that's what i want let's get yours over here you get two it's a tablespoon zero it out in there eight eight twenty eight on the nose now we get mustard mustard mustard that comes down because she didn't took her time well i know she's pretty fast ah and no pepper we're just salting today no butt rub nothing you just want to try it okay you guys this is pretty dang tasty looks tasty if i ever could get some in my mouth this is dinner it is chicken and a uh mayonnaise mustard aioli yum you guys huh yeah little boy i'm ready let's go come on can i have my food now you can there you go so i didn't eat this drumstick and those are my drumstick and the bones 363 so what i do is i subtract the bones and the drumstick i put the drumstick back in the meat and um i'll redo my um macros based on how much i actually ate same with harry right so okay you guys the day did not go as planned but we planned the day so at least we got our food we'll make any adjustments to the amount um once i get the bones out of mine and i'll share everything tomorrow you guys if you guys like what you see please like subscribe ring that bell give me a thumbs up you guys i'll see you tomorrow you wait for her chicken yeah i know she is we'll get hers we're gonna pull some chicken get her a little bit of chicken for [Music] dinner [Music] so [Music] you", "KVgXgnKlWpk": "hey everyone santa cruz weed man here coming to you once again from santa cruz california it's a beautiful day here i hope um everyone watching this is also um having a nice day so uh today it's my 36th cannabis review um doing a blind review plus a uh unpacking and an unboxing of sorts let's call it um so that should be kind of a fun little activity so without further ado here we go so today this is a product from jetty extracts jetty gave me this nice little gift bag thank you very much jetty for this we'll go ahead and open this up um just like christmas morning here we go um so we have a little pamphlet here i'm going to go over this um shortly it talks about what this product is going to be unrefined resin so that's really good and informative this battery i put back in there the jetty 510 thread vape battery and little usb charger on the top just unscrew that off yeah so we got a 510 battery here 510 thread good with all the 510 battery or 510 cartridges excuse me now i've used that in a previous review um i got this little gift bag a while ago um but uh for the purposes of of the review i put it back in there and then here is the product we're going to be reviewing today the jetty extracts unrefined live resin um it is one full gram it's testing at 84.17 percent thc very high testing it's a indica and the strain is legend oh gee up top there um yeah and it's dollars before tax um if you were to pick one up at uh the dispensary i work for uh kind people's uh two locations in santa cruz so you can get this for sixty dollars before tax and i think they have a couple different ones yeah they have a couple different ones of the unrefined type so and that's on the pamphlets i'll talk about that so we'll talk about unrefined first so here we go i'll read off the pamphlet um unrefined better high uncut single source nothing added no distillate never distilled or blended flour high real entourage effect just like flour um so basically uh to sum that up it's um kind of the closest uh experience to flower in terms of the taste experience aroma that you're gonna get out of vape cartridges they're not doing anything to mess with it they're not extracting distillate they're not extracting thc they're not adding terpenes taking away terpenes it's the truest form of the flower brought into a vape cartridge so that's that they have them in different forms there's the dablicator which is an oil applicator i'm not really sure what that is but uh be curious to learn more about that um they have for pax aeropods pax is just another version of vape cartridges but uh you can get a pax pen and then get these pods that are compatible with it and then what i'm using today which is the um 510 thread battery and then the 510 thread jetty extracts unrefined live resin cartridge so i'm going to read the back just shortly too uh so unrefined live resin uncut no distillate flower high jetty unrefined live resin is extracted with an ultralight touch preserving more terpenes cannabinoids and other plant compounds it's a close it's as close to the plant a live resin can get for a true flower high so that's really nice for anyone who really enjoys the benefits the the experience of smoking flower versus wax or oils or you know there's a lot of you know stuff going on in labs today to be more creative with cannabis and and try new techniques but this is really kind of a technique that actually brings it more back to the basics of traditional um flower smoking so and i want to talk about the legendo g which is what i'm going to be using for the review today so legendary it's an indica dominant hybrid this one is primarily petrol and earthy flavors with a sweet fruity finish in the lab we describe it as sweet og it's an indica dominant hybrid with relaxing heavy on your eyelids type feeling so um i guess that's in quotes so i guess maybe just someone who works there or someone who reviewed it like myself and then gave a little description it's a good description um and then so they have uh one two three four five five different unrefined live resins right now that jetty's uh making so legend og is one that's the one we're going to be reviewing today super glue is another um that's an indica dominant also blue dreams sativa dominant black lime and then emerald og which are both also indica dominant so um that's this little pamphlet interesting information and uh here we go back to the cartridge i'll go ahead and open this up it looks like it has a little scissor thing on the bottom but maybe if i just oh there we go so i just kind of pushed and turned and then this little seal broke i can open it like that open the caps open but there we go here it is so it comes in a little standard plastic tube i'll close that top first show you the full thing so there it is there's our um legend og um jetty cartridge let's uh push the two sides to get that top open again there we go has this little thing we can just peel that off we don't need that and there we go and now uh one thing i really like about the jetties and i've mentioned this i think i did one or two jd reviews in the past is the wooden tips that's just a really cool added feature um the only company i know that does this with their cartridges so i really like that you can see the [Music] oil in there is super dark uh which i think is telling the fact that it's unrefined they didn't mess with this at all um it's it's uh or at least very little it has you know as much of the original components of the legendary g flower as as possible when when extracting the oil so it's got this nice little gold seal on the bottom there kind of like a rose gold i really like that that's super neat very just formal and kind of classy let's say so here we go so take off the little rubber end on the bottom there you have your cartridge there with the 510 jetty battery again i love this battery because there's no buttons it just is at a low setting it makes it easy you never want to go above a green setting on the ones that have the different heat settings or above like two to 2.5 watts on the ones that have the little dials on the bottom so this is just basically there all the time all you got to do is charge it up with the little usb um same as the other 510 uh batteries and then it's good to go and you don't have to worry about any buttons so that's really nice so we're going to go ahead and screw this on i'll give this cartridge a few whiffs so i'm getting sweety and earthy tones a lot sweeter than any of the other cartridges i can i have tried and can remember um yeah really sweet and earthy um so let's go ahead and um start hitting this uh legendo g from jetty extracts unrefined live resin um this is the time in the review or if you got something to smoke on something to vape um you know edibles whatever your thing is go ahead and do that now cheers everybody 36 for view here we go yeah it's amazing the difference that this unrefined versus refined process makes it really is like using flour now i've never tried it out of the packs pens i've only ever used these 510 thread batteries but it really is a totally different experience between the unrefined and the refined you're just getting so much more of that raw flour flavor taste aromas all of that with the unrefined and you notice in the effects too which i'll talk about shortly here once i once they kind of intensify so my one um kind of uh negative point with the jetty cartridges is they really um kind of sit in my nasal passages and sting a little bit they're a little annoying in the in the nose and i'm not a fan of that so um that's one thing that i really [Music] wish they would improve upon and why i don't use them as much as i would like to but that sweet taste and earthy taste is definitely present i'm getting that from from the hits already the effects were kind of kicking in with that nice relaxing body high nice head relaxation too just overall kind of calming relaxing effect it's really really nice these cartridges are a little bit harsh as well so um you know definitely take it slow i'm kind of going a little faster for the review purposes but um you know just kind of use it in your own time you don't want to bust your cartridge or your throat or anything like that so i wish the uh flavor uh carried through a little bit more because the smell is really nice the the aroma is a lot better than the taste um yeah in the taste i'm missing the what i'm really getting from the aromas which is that super sweet earthy kind of um smell the effects are nice very true of uh you know indica dominant hybrid with kind of that just overall calming relaxation i could feel like if you used enough of it to be good for sleep definitely good for stress relief may be good for some muscle tension or pain aches stuff like that um but yeah it's it's you know good overall um let me take a few more hits before i give it a rating here right i'm gonna stick to the rating i had in my head for this one i'm going seven two out of ten not a bad score pretty average um i like that it's unrefined i like that it's true to the flour it doesn't really make much of a difference um in the taste for me but it does make a difference in the smell for sure um i would say um maybe this is just a super smelly um strain um but uh but i do think that the unrefined process versus refined does have a um does make a difference in that kind of um smell taste terpene category um the effects are really nice um just uh you know kind of that indica calmness relaxation like i said good for sleep muscle aches pain tension stuff like that stress um depression um yeah it's good uh i think a 7.2 is um is definitely fair um i would say increased appetite maybe a little bit with this one too um but yeah so that's my review of the um legendo g uh one gram unrefined live resin from jetty extracts um yeah 36 reviews 7.2 out of 10. thank you everyone as always for watching subscribing commenting

injured I can talk last week trust one another trusting in the Lord Thank You Wesley I see I can see some of the participants breaking a sweat at least I'm imagining that you are breaking a sweat I was moving too I was there moving in my hands you know one scientist said ow you know all we have to do is move mean just move your legs move your hands if you are restricted to a chair just move we were made to move we learned that when we discussed activity a couple weeks ago so thank you again and a question was asked whether or not we're gonna have or simply nah next week next week being um Easter Sunday and so initially we we did not plan to but since you're all at home why not anyway if you could just send a send India a response to the question should we have all Christian health seminar next week time if you are gonna be available and you think we should have it just indicate my texts are calling in you have the numbers or just relating that information to your table leave we'd love to know what your what's your opinion what do you think about us having it so please let us know also we want to a number of you are asking about a workbook they workbook that you got a copy of and some of you were asking for some of the responses or the answers and some of those workbooks and so this evening we wanted to share some of that with you they last two weeks ago we pretty and that we talked about trust there are pieces of shared trust he will share some of the answers to that as well as interpersonal relationship but for activity if you here to take your workbooks out those of you who have one if you don't you can again indicate to us and we will try and get one to you but the question and this is on page 20 so if you have your workbook and you can reach to it it's page 20 or you could just write record their responses so we have exercise X the first question was at the first statement is exercise or a mind the word mind and body next word is body slows the effects of aging so here's a recipe here you wanna slow down effects of aging do your exercise and not just your number to regulate the word there's exercise we're gonna exercise the brain to build a strong mind they were there's exercise number three start each day with a healthy breakfast eat low glycemic foods those are foods in which they Lucas is not sorry the carbohydrate is not very quickly converted to glucose so here oatmeal and your whole-grain these are low have low glycemic index and so these are the types of food we encourage you to eat at the beginning of the day for your breakfast moving on we'll talk some about that in subsequent seminars next question food is healthiest the way the ground there's God created it so the word is God and finally the brain needs large amounts of oxygen that's what's missing there large amounts of oxygen to function optimally that was helpful I'm just filling the blanks and as I mentioned earlier Barry when he takes over it would and share with you the responses or the answers to those questions on the trust as well as interpersonal relationship understand we have Agnes we've we were with us and I'm gonna turn over to her right now as she walks us through nutrition facts thank you if you have guests it's going to be I'll show you in the next slide okay good afternoon this is Agnes and today I'm going to talk about the food group with a bad rap and we're going to go to talk about fats the classifications effect Loxley if you can turn to the next slide okay here we go here I've listed pets in three categories here the first one is unsaturated fats and it comes primarily from vegetable sources and they are much healthier for you and under this heading we have two kinds we have the mono unsaturated fats as well as the poly unsaturated fats and that includes a omega-3 fats which is too low it's good for lowering your cholesterol your triglycerides so the second group is saturated fats it comes primarily from animal sources and those are less healthy because they tend to up your arteries now the the category of fat is trans fats trans fats is found in some processed foods it is an unhealthy kind of fat and should be avoided so let's take a look at this slide here so you see this al Fariq three categories here you have trans fats saturated fats and you see a X P star beside it which means to say try to avoid this or at least at least eat as little as you can and then you see a check mark on unsaturated fats that's the one you want to have in your mousse because this do not clog your arteries as you can see I have put different examples on it so I think if you go to the next slide you can see the examples better here we go so I'm saturated fats versus saturated fats so if you look at the category of our answer to the facts you will see a la Vida from plant sources by avocados there's a good that the mayonnaise if you use the light like mayonnaise nuts olives then the different oils canola oil eat peanuts corn soybean safflower sunflower grape seed flax seed oils lose that belong to unsaturated fats then you have margarine you have also seeds the flat seeds pumpkin says means sunflower the some good seeds and then you have salad dressings especially we're encouraged to use light salad dressings now let's move to the category on saturated fats you see the bacon you see butter now coconut someone you may be surprised that coconut is actually listed as saturated fats the jury's still out there and has not removed it from that category because coconut oil and cream if you set it in room temperature it was to live our solidified so and so it is actually saturated now if you look at the creams the heavy creams light and wick creams half in half they all belong to saturated fats the cream cheese the Lord in the different kinds of oils like coconut and palm oil palm oil you find that in a lot of our cookies and cakes they are saturated oils then shortening and sour cream so let's look at the next slide here now what tell me about trans fat trans fat is actually trans fatty acids so it's a type of fact that it's man-made what happens is the manufacturer will what they are we take vegetable oils which is good eyes and then pretty much tweak it to make it into a semi solid state so is that really an unhealthy substance that is made through the hydrogenation of oils so hydrogenation solidifies liquid so for trans-fats it increases the shelf life so that's why it's so to our food manufacturers to increase the shelf life of foods as well as the flavor flavor stability of oils and foods that is wine you find out our cookies and cakes have transfected added to it so it doesn't spoil that easily you can live out your a lot of breads and cookies for a week and it doesn't grow mold it's because of the trans fat in it as well so let's take a look at the next slide here so I can transfer do why are we worried about trans fat because trans fat can raise your bad cholesterol the bad cholesterol is LDL sometimes we call it the lousy cholesterol and yeah it will lower the good cholesterol which is your HDL or the healthy cholesterol so it really a trans fat can spell double trouble for your heart because it costs of your a please so be way that if a food has less than 0.5 grams of trans fats per serving the FDA says you can legally label it as having zero trans fat so even if you read the label as transfer as zero grams they can technically have about 5.5 grams of trans fat in it so then how do we know if there is trans fat in our foods well the code word for trans fat is let's take a look partially hydrogenated always so if you're reading your ingredient list on your label which with our tissue next week if you see this word partially hydrogenated or hydrogenated oils it really means is the other word for trans fats so yeap and probably don't want to buy that package of just slip it back on put it back on the shelf there so let's take a look at the next slide here so here are some examples of foods with trans fats in them as mentioned I say the crackers the cookies the cakes the frozen pies when I talk about cakes usually usually kicks down pre baked and and frozen and other baked goods you have like snack items like microwave popcorn frozen pizza fast foods vegetable shortening and some stick mutterings do have trans fat in it and talking about that we also have a coffee creamer refrigerate the dough now your biscuit dough or your cinnamon rolls etc and ready to use frostings now let's talk about peanut butter here most peanut butter has trans fat in it except the natural kind so when I'm counseling patients we usually encourage them to use the natural peanut butter the natural peanut butter is the one that the oil rights rises to the top actually peanut butter Shawn you have two ingredients peanuts and a little bit of salt anything else is about pretty much junk so try to eat choose the peanut butter only choose the natural kinds all right so let's move along here so let's look at some dietary fat and recommendations number one choose a diet that's low in what saturated fat and cholesterol use nonfat dairy products use light salad dressing light mayonnaise and soft top mutterings the worst kind of margarine is one there is the stick kind so choose always like olive oil canola oil and cannot always limit high fat meats use more vegetable protein foods limit baked goods eat fewer fried foods and avoid trans fat be careful when eating out because a lot of the stuff have trans fat in it so it's important to read food labels because it will give you a lot of information there so how much fat should I have well the answer is one to two servings of added fat but some of the fat is already present in your protein foods so therefore we do not need to add in so much added fat into our meals if a person is going to lose weight so one serving might be I'll do it if not the max is two servings so let's look and see what the serving effect looks like so we're going to say that it contains 5 grams of fat and 45 calories so example someone serving effect is 1 teaspoon of oil it's already one serving a pet 1 tablespoon of salad dressing 2 tablespoon of avocados a lot of people say well avocado some good so I'm gonna eat 2 of them but that would be overdoing it just because effect and I think that has good fat we cannot overdo it so to taste 2 tbsp of avocado is actually already serving effect and look at nuts a lot of people are eating all the eating on the nuts they say where they are not so good it's very good but even a good stuff we cannot overdo it so one serving of almonds and cashews is only six it's not half a can 10 peanuts for walnut house and one teaspoon of marjoram so as you can see on the examples we do not need a whole lot of that so a little bit goes a long way well that concludes my presentation and I will give the screen back to brother lately oh thank you so much Agnes so much about food made me hungry in a minute though we'll be going over to Sandra's kitchen we promise that we will open up the lines to those who may have a question for you at time or comments [Music] oh I see in in Inga's ing es Inga's up I pronounce that right we're gonna take your call Inga's using an iPhone go ahead please hello yes go ahead I'm sorry I didn't hear what you asked me we're taking questions on Agnes presentation about fats did you have any question or comments on that oh no I I was just taking notes on what she was seeing and listening thank you though okay yeah welcome you could please go back a newt so generally anyone have questions for Agnes or any comments you'd like to make if not removing right around you okay going once gone all right we're gonna move right now into Sandra's kitchen Sandra you ready for us I think you are with the cooking demonstration for today hellowho even number one welcome separation helped who demonstration my name is Tonya Fulton and I'm about to demonstrate a special Calif found on page 65 before we begin let's say a word of prior a better father thank you for your gracious rushes thank you for your openness so I'm going to use my [Music] [Music] [Music] this is a mush DeMatha so then I can always add okay now so that's one pack up to Patong tofu from extra firm and now I will be highly in mind one teaspoon onion powder okay one teaspoon onion powder okay when I put the authorities and then I'll be putting in teaspoon garlic powder and afterward I'll be putting a stalk of celery already find the chopper so I'm putting in my celery has regulated and then we're going to have energy egg replacer this is energy egg replacer because we do not use egg so we use this you can either use it right or you can mix it with water so I firmly see Miley in them I'm gonna pour some water which I have right behind me here and the spoon over here to mix it the reason why I like to use a dry ingredient you got egg replacer make it easier for me I don't have to mix I just pour it in there but for today I'm going to be mixing it with some water okay so this is gonna be it is to holding the rope together that's what it does it's a little bit it's gonna be thick and mix it out and then I'm gonna pour it into it the rest of the mix from the container as you can see this is what is going to be it looks like creamy very me like white and creamy it looks like as you can see this is what it looks like hey takes a little time mixing it out and maybe that's why I prefer to music in my team right so now I'm going to pour it into my mixture okay almost finished with this top takes a little time this but I guess you better get a better result when we mix it I'm gonna use dry it but I prefer dry anyway come back okay so now so now I'm going to use one and a half cups of pecans already crying so here I am facing all together which [Music] the nicest thing about is if you have ready make it easy for you to put it on and now I'm gonna put my McCain deep like season in it and then I mix it around and mix it to make sure it well now I'm going to put in my walk-up special chain which is here I told you [Music] [Music] but I put it in so that I can on Nelson anytime you get them in the soft so I don't have to melt it but if you like you can if you put it out before you're ready for a little bit soft head if not you have to melt it if you want to use it take it from the frigerator to use it right away they take a little more time together you can either put it in the microwave and you second get it melt attic or you can leave each other who attends with you to get a little melted and that's a ball I'm gonna be puttin you saw your milk which is one cup of soya milk okay you can use all your milk or you can use almond plain almond milk to mix it together [Music] okay this is what it's going to be looking like and then this is free may for any holiday point any spring party olive oil I wanted you can use your preference so now I'm gonna just pour it into the pan [Music] you can use a smaller deeper one or you can use the same size as this this is a I'm not sure what size - it would be but it you can use a great pan or you can also use this permutation that goes in it or you can use your choice but when you are doing this you have a choice of what you would like to use okay so now my loaf is ready and it's ready for the oven and this is what oh that looks like finishing so now I'm about to put it in the oven because it's already really welcome back now we're finished our table so I'm about to take it out of the oven now okay it was not within an hour in I have to cut this loaf and something we can also serve with the chicken gravy brown gravy you use chicken light season to make this one you'll find it on page 64 so you can go to page 54 and find the recipe for gravy or you can also serve it with any gravy that you like so this is the finish markets this thing is pretty hot so I'm gonna breed up with you closer to you can see the finishing work this is the book okay it's looking good so I'm about to cut this road to see what it tastes like okay here I go it's a bit soft you see when you get colder it gets a little bit more firmly so at this point it's still a little bit of salt okay and I got my little bit crunchy and the outside it can be soft inside but crunchy on the outside because that's the way I like my loaf okay so now I use a spatula and I transfer it to a plate and I would like I'm getting ready to taste it now okay in as you can see this is quite pleasant and a plate so I'm showing you so I'm about to taste it all right can I taste it yes you may taste it too right also you may serve it with mashed potato it will be in gravy it is very delicious now we take the worm so now I have to do something so I leave it here to get cool and bye until next time take the Arab winter doing cooking class with you okay thank you sister Fulton that that special K loaf look very good you know if you've never had a special K loaf I'm telling you you are in for a real treat I love special K loaf and I'm not at all surprised to see brother Fulton get into that kitchen and grab it so as we continue to move through our program I wanted to introduce to you the video presentation that we have for you today on interpersonal relationships what I love about the creation health model is that there's a focus on not only health for the body but also health for the mind and how it interplays with one another when you have a healthy body and you have a healthy mind that's when you achieve optimal health and so that's really what this presentation is about and that's what this video was about so hope that you sit back relax and enjoy the video presentation that we have for you this evening as we explore the I in the acronym creation health on interpersonal relationships [Music] in 1985 on average each of us have three people in five important matters by 2004 and today research indicates that 25% of Americans have no 1 2 3 5 it is it's sad to realize that one out of every four people in need with socially isolated this social isolation is associated with a host of emotional and physical illnesses in general people tend to engage in destructive behaviors such as alcoholism smoking overeating because the only relationships in relationships tell one javadi and a quality of life we'll also see some ways to create and maintain healthy relationships as you know our theme for this seminar is living life to the fullest which is God's will for our lives social connection is one of the things that makes this possible so what do we mean by social connection or social connectedness well in the broadest sense it means interacting with others and that means with God as well as other people relationships are one of life's greatest blessings healthy interpersonal relationships include good communication sharing touch encouragement and trust these qualities create an environment of Hope trust and belonging let's learn a little more about the latest research on social connection and its profound impact on health and wellness [Music] isn't it amazing how time spent with a friend can make you happy but researchers are becoming more and more alarmed by a certain trend people are disconnecting from each other socially in 1985 on average each of us had three people in whom we could confide important matters but by 2004 only two and today research indicates that 25 percent of Americans have no one to confide in isn't it sad to realize that one out of every four people you meet is socially isolated and this social isolation is associated with emotion in general people tend to engage in destructive behaviors such as alcoholism smoking and overeating to help cope with their Lohan's because the only thing in life that really matters is our loving relationships friends family even pets say hello to one of my buddies Oreo speaking of which do you have a buddy and I'm not just talking about a pet somebody who loves you and wants to help you if your answer is yes then you just may have a three to five times lower risk of premature death and disease we need friends and today we'll see and hear so let's join dr. Winnie King ending information on interpersonal relationships what do you think buddy Oreo says yes there are people in my life who just make me smile whenever I think of them they lift me up and make my there are people who well you know those kind of people it's an undeniable fact that good interpersonal relationships improve our life dr. Dean Ornish writes this about friendships I'm not aware of any other factor in medicine not diet not smoking not exercise not stress not genetics not drugs not surgery that has a greater impact on our quality of life incidents of illness and premature death from all causes [Music] President Abraham don't to a part of one slide cyst specially during the cold and flu season but consider this counterintuitive study volunteers were given nasal drops that contain the common cold virus and as you would expect most of them became infected but those were the most friends or less likely to develop pull symptoms social connection and interpersonal relationships foster good health and happiness meaning friends equates with better health after the video okay hey everyone I'm not sure if I'm one as far as I can tell okay well as far as I can tell I'm still viewing Joe rightly screen so once we get that situated okay here we go so we're gonna start the presentation but I just need a few moments to pull the presentation up so that I can share the slides with you so if you just give me just a moment and I'll be happy to share this very very informative presentation I will say I like the science of interpersonal relationships so we're gonna be looking at some some scientific studies today I hope I don't get too far into the minutiae of that but but but I think you're going to find it very very interesting as we begin this topic so here we are on creation health and we're on the I of the acronym creation health rendered personal relationships create a full and happy life just a moment please well I'm still trying to get myself together here we are okay and so here in this slide we're just showing the the acronym and we are here on interpersonal ownership people are essential to well-being so relationships and health a social system is vital to our health and this is going to be a proven fact and we'll see some studies that demonstrate that your your relationships can make the difference between sickness and health and I'm also going to show you some information to prove that as well so the Bible tells us in Genesis chapter 2 verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone it's just very interesting to me as Adam was looking at all of the different creatures on the earth he saw that they were all paired up he felt lonely for himself he wanted to have a mate as well and so God us to be that way as you can see here in this slide God created us to benefit from relationships and he himself craves a relationship with us so this presentation will focus on number one how your social connections predict your health by affecting your longevity and quality of life and two we're going to help you to create and maintain healthy relationships so we're just gonna go over some tips on how to on how you might go about doing that and of course our theme text john 10:10 i have come that you may live life to the fullest or live or have life and have it more abundantly so when we talk about social connection what are we what are we talking about and a broadest sense it's a means it means that you're interacting with others especially with God but with other people you're interacting with nature you're just getting out and doing some things and so indicators of healthy interpersonal relationships include good communication servanthood sharing and we're going to talk more about these types of topics here so sharing touch touch is such an important part when it comes to interpersonal relationships we didn't see that part of the video but there are some studies on on on touch and how it affects your perceptions of how you interact with others encouragement and trust they create an environment of hope closeness and a sense of a sense of belonging one that you can confide in so you already saw in a video a message here from dr. Dean Ornish what I want to I want to redisplay that because dr. Dean Ornish is a physician that works on reversing heart disease and when you think about his program mostly you think about the low-fat diet you think about the exercise you think about all those kinds of components which is good but when he's asked what is the most Cornette thing about your your your program what works the best and his response is the relationships that are built in his programs he says that I'm not aware of any other factor in medicine not diet not smoking not exercise not stress not genetics not drugs not surgery that has a greater impact on our quality of life incidence of illness and premature death from all causes and also want to point out here that this is what makes the creation health models so intriguing because we've split up into our groups and then we work with each other we create a community within our groups and that's what makes I think one of the main factors that makes the creation health model so effective in improving our health so do you ever find yourself feeling sad lonely or depressed and if you do you're not the only one one-third of people have reported feeling lonely loneliness here twenty-five percent of Americans have no one at all to confide in twenty five percent twenty nine million people twenty nine million people live alone now when we say live alone what I think what what what that slide is trying to say is they live alone and then there's no other social outlet they are by themselves okay and then loneliness is becoming a major disease as we find now that we're more in a society where people don't communicate face-to-face anymore unfortunately here during this coronavirus outbreak we're having to communicate more through online means but what we find here is that people who don't have those abilities are feeling more and more socially isolated so there is a three to five times greater risk of heart disease with loneliness loneliness and isolation affect your health negatively and causes premature death by up to five hundred percent which is just a mind-blowing number so support from others do you have anyone who really cares for you who feels close to you who loves you who wants to help you and someone that you can confide in if you can answer yes to those questions then you have a three to five times lower risk of premature death and and disease from all other causes this again is taking out any other factor in your health just having those connections lowers your risk for premature death and you will see some more information on that as we go along so loneliness as you saw in the video already increases incidence of alcohol and drug abuse increases smoking here a lot of church-going folks we may have this one overeating loneliness definitely causes a lot of overeating perhaps overworking you just spend your time at work since you have nothing you feel like you have nothing else to do increases depression and again premature death by 500% now time to get into some of the some of the science I love these studies one study I want to point out here is the Alameda County study this is a longitudinal study they say follow 7,000 people for 40 years so it's just an amazing study but the long and the short of it what they found is people classified as lonely and isolated had three times higher mortality who didn't even make it through to the forty years or people with and then conversely people with many social context had the lowest mortality rates the amount of social support was the best predictor the best predictor for a good health how much social support you have you're living for somebody else when you when you're when you're connected to other people the best predictor for good health so characteristics of people who live past 100 years old they're active but number two look at that they're socially connected they have they have people that they can can interact with friends and family they're not smokers they have healthy diets and then of course they get they rat their rest and they live with the purpose here's another study that I wanted to point out to you this study of cancer patients who participated in a weekly support group for 90 minutes they looked at them and they looked at their death rate and then they looked at the reoccurrence of their cancer so six years later people in the support group had a 70% reduction in death rate and almost half of reoccurrences so people in a support group here you can see in this blue bar their death rate was much much lower than people who they found who had similar cancers that did not participate in a support group here you find in this category the reoccurrence so yes the cancer recurred but even the reoccurrence was much lower and people who were in a support from people who had those connections versus people who did not participate in a support group you can see their reoccurrence rate was much much higher so support and your immune system when you when so when social support is increased our loneliness is reduced the immune system is actually strengthened we kind of talked about that a little bit last week when we when we talked about how your immune system is strengthened when you feel a connection with the Lord so a boost to your immunity here they did a study where they sprayed that virus in a nasal spray there were 276 people who had agreed to do this but 276 healthy volunteers were exposed to the common cold virus but interestingly enough the people who were had more social relationships they had they were less likely to actually get sick from that nasal spray when they were exposed to the common cold virus so that's a very very that's a very very interesting study as well so connectedness and recovery so here is a no this is a very interesting study this study was you've taken two group he's got people he separated them out into two groups and one group you gave them special care you showed them what their surgery was going to be like they the both groups had surgery by the way I'm sorry you showed in one group what their surgery is gonna be like what the post-operative period was gonna be like what the pain was gonna be like you showed the relaxation techniques and then after the surgery what they did was they had the anesthesiologist come around not just once a day to make rounds they came around two three four times a day so they developed this connection to the surgery team they developed this connection with the anesthesiologist whereas the other group they just went through the normal surgical procedure during a normal care that you normally get nobody received subpar care but in the test group they received extra care extra support extra attention and what they found was the people who received extra care they reduced their post-operative narcotic requirements by 50% just the extra care to extra attention and they decrease their hospital days the hospital stay about 2.7 days so you can just see how social connectedness is just so critical the healthy mind is a healthy body here's another study 2320 men who survived a heart attack well they had these men that survived a heart attack they went back and studied them over a five to nine year period what they found people those men who were in high-stress environment who were socially isolated they were four times more likely to die from this heart disease than men who were more socially connected and lived of course on a lower stress environment and this is true controlling for other important prognostic factors such as your genetics how much exercise you get what your diet is like your weight your smoking history those things controlling for those things we still found or the researchers in this case still found four times more likely to die if you were socially isolated here's another study so the people in Nippon Japan what they found here is that these are the people who have the longest life expectancy some of the people who have the longest life expectancy in the world well there are people who emigrated from that community from that area of Japan and and they studied them the people who immigrated to Honolulu into San Francisco 11900 Japanese what they found was what what the reason one of the reasons why they do so well with their life expectancy is that this is a very tight-knit community they share things they are very socially well-connected and what they found was the people who immigrated to other areas to Honolulu and to San Francisco when those people retained their traditional Japanese culture of support they had the same prevalence of heart disease the same low prevalence of heart disease as those people who just lived right there in Japan so it's just so critical as we can see here that your environment affects your health your your practices your daily activities really does affect your long-term health so social support again in your immune system when social support is increased immune system is strengthened relationships interpersonal relationships there's a buffer to disease as we've seen and complications from any age we even see where you have higher social support during labor they decrease the need for c-section and even decrease labor time social connectedness and adolescence so this is interesting study they studied 90,000 teens eighteen thousand of their parents and basically what they found is to make a long story short cause I know we are short on time already what they found is kids who feel connected to family church school community were far less likely likely to participate in behaviors that put them at risk and here's another slide that demonstrates that adolescents who are connected to their parents their families and their school community are healthier than those who are who are not so not only do we want to make sure that we're socially connected as adults we also want to make sure that our children especially our teenagers have social connections they have social outlets people that they can interact with and form a community hopefully a healthy community so social connectedness and marriage does your spouse know that you loved them that you know and you know you don't think you have to ask ask that question but it's such an important question that's your spouse know that you love them if they if they don't please make sure that they know here's another interesting study so what they found here was they took people who have a blocked coronary artery okay now I don't know in the study whether or not they unblocked it whether or not they just put them on medicine what happened there but what they found is when they just took these people with these blocked coronary arteries and they followed them over five years those people who were who were married who had who had healthy marriages had a higher survival rate than people who did not and this again is just taking out all the other factors just looking at the fact that they were connected they had a higher survival rate of that terrible disease where your coronary arteries blocked when and also could decrease your function of your heart happily married women and had a stronger immune system here again and report less depression and loneliness connectedness and older adults what predicts positive aging a good marriage at age 50 and of course of course low cholesterol at age 50 as well so we've got to be careful about ice cream intake as well as other things so the loves influence we talked about love last week a little bit when we feel loved we choose healthier behaviors that is a common common thing I want to talk a little bit about pet relationships we found some very interesting things with that one year after being hospitalized with chest pain or heart attack 6% of pet owners died compared to 28% of patients who did not own pets so you just find out that that connectedness with pets that unconditional love that you can get from a pet we find that we find positive health benefits from that this finding again is independent of other factors severity of your disease exercise other known factors it's independent of that we're finding that pet owners generally speaking have higher survival rates from these from these illnesses the DVD we didn't get a chance to see it but the DVD gives us pointers gives us tips on ways we can improve our interpersonal relationships you want it points out reaching out to those saying hello being interactive with people mingling going around and and just having conversations with others and that's something that you know even I still work on volunteering is another big thing we're gonna see I have some more studies but we're going to see how volunteering helps accepting people unconditionally so the helpers hi a sir 3296 volunteers doing all kinds of helping 95% of those who regularly help others experience of helpers hi they actually it made them feel good I'm sure many of you can say that you can excuse experience that where you feel good when you help others and you gain health benefits so here's an interesting quote about volunteering about helping others and asking the overworked person to make additions to an already busy day I can easily imagine a skeptical laughter of readers who feel sufficiently pushed to the wall by their existing job responsibilities it is ironic but true that one way to relieve the pressure is to do something extra actually doing something for others who takes away the stress that you may feel in your everyday job john d rockefeller giving is the secret giving is the secret of a healthy life tips for healthy relationships so I just want to leave you with a few tips things that you can do to establish or to maintain healthy relationships be open positive communication and including encouragement spend time with people the person that you want to have that healthy relationship with you have to spend time with them healing touch holding hands just just making time and in touching others that you love is such an important thing and it helps you improve your health forgiving one another the power of forgiveness pray that pray for those who hurt you have a positive attitude about your relationships be flexible and of course last but not least don't play fair what I mean by that is we often treat people how they treat us that's playing fair what I'm suggesting here is that you want you if you want your delicious just to improve you don't play fair you treat people better than what they treat you and you will find that you have positive relationships that develop out of that so and in trying to make our conclusion here I know a little bit over try to understand how people are similar to you but also how they might be different from you and accept their differences again with hope you find here from those studies that you will have health benefits we need to learn how to forgive and enable forgive to enable us to get rid of our anger and be free to engage in healthy relationships make time for others okay send a card when you're thinking about somebody send a card or even a text message reach out and connect call someone special set a lunch date or a dinner date and then I think it's so important again healthy touch hug someone but we may have to wait until the coronavirus crisis is over but when it is over hug someone fine find someone who you care about and even now find someone who you care about and give them a hug and let them know that you love them and care for them my favorite quote in all of creation health my favorite quote remember it is better to eat Twinkies with friends than broccoli by yourself we want you to be healthy we want you to to focus on good health habits good diet exercise but we don't want you to focus on that to the point where you lose connectivity with your family with your friends with people of your support group okay we want you to stay connected with others share with other people that's what that text what that sees no text but what that quote is saying so truly abundant life is achievable only when we're connected remember connecting through close interpersonal relationships profoundly impacts your optimal health so choose to connect with others today so that you can live your life to the fullest that concludes our

responses you'll you'll find that some of the questions we can be answered out of the presentation but I want to go ahead and share it with you so if everybody's there on page 28 right there at the top it reads in 1985 on average each of us had blank people in which we could confide and the answer there that you want to select is or don't you want to input is 3 in 1985 on average each of us had 3 people in which we could confide the next line goes into in 2004 what number sorry 2004 that number had dropped to blank people the answer there is to in 2004 that number had dropped to two people

guy give you a moment to turn to it while I do as well all right so trust the DVD presentation notice the two trees and this is of course talking about the Garden of Eden one tree the tree of life and tree of knowledge of good and evil so the tree of blank and well what they're trying to say here is the Tree of Life is about all things good the Tree of Life is about all things good the next line the tree of knowledge of good and evil then it says the tree of blank and so the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the tree of self of selfishness of evil things is what is given to us from the video as our answer the next line full blank requires full trust full freedom full freedom God has given us freedom to choose and full freedom requires full trust the next line God is blank with you blank forgives you and blank loves you the answer there is always God is always with you always forgives you and always loves you the next line God's blank are a dimension of trust God's promises are a dimension of trust so just to go over this top part very quickly here the Tree of Life is about all things all good things the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the true is the tree of self or selfishness full freedom requires full trust God is always with you always forgives you and always loves you God's promises are a dimension of trust going to the next section how do you build trust and faith Blanc sort the answer they're God's promises so the answer we want to put on the air is claiming you build faith by claiming by claiming God's promises the next line again blank God's promises you want to live God's promises so you want to claim God's promises and that you want to live God's promises you want to live that life your life becomes changed when you claim God's promises blank is a dynamic of trust prayer prayer is a dynamic of trust look to God first not as a last resort make prayer a lifestyle like talking to a friend and then we come to the next blank blank

give us the closing remarks and prayer already family I just as you guys have heard has everyone has heard the importance of interpersonal relationships I know I know that listening to the presentations and everything I know probably can't but wonder how can we apply that to ourselves now with the situation that we're in I think we can still make the effort and it was mentioned in the presentation we can still make the effort to get on our devices and and try to reach out to those who are not we can intercede in prayer for those that we can't physically be with or reach out to I know there are a number of cases of people right now who are in a hospital bed and can't receive visitors this is where we need to use our faith we need to depend and trust in our Lord God our Creator he has angels that are ministering and visiting those who can't receive from even home calls so do what you can I I pray that this this the time that we're living in now would would open our eyes to realize the importance of interpersonal relationship reach out to all your loved ones make the phone calls I'm stay in touch and and God will do the rest we we have no other choice but to trust in in our Creator he is he is everything he is our everything now so keep that in mind and those of you where you are join me now and in a word of Prayer Emily father I thank you so much once again for

baby Joby [Applause] ha [Applause]", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we

up", "8WdVfFu_ta4": "hey guys welcome to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this is turkey Tuesday episode 12 today I'm reviewing the Sunkist cake batter this is a live resum cake batter from canta biotics here in California this stuff is outstanding last year in the 2525 2015 High Times Cannabis Cup this stuff took first place of course Antipa concentrate and I can absolutely understand why the orange flavor on this and the tangi notes on it are so pungent it just lets you know that dabbing this is gonna is going to be a mouthful of orange citrus tangi terpenes and and it's funny the little Sunkist logo on it is just like the the Sunkist logo on dun sodas and I feel like I enjoy and I know it's kind of sketchy gray area probably legally to have logos like this on concentrates but I feel like it's really cool to have food branding stuff on concentrates especially when it comes to things like fruit flavors and things like like Gorilla Glue like a lot of times when you see the Gorilla Glue logos around it kind of looks like the gorilla glue letters on the on the gorilla wood things like that this this Sunkist definitely immediately seen the logo makes you think okay this got to be got to be kind of like orange soda right you know and it really is I can see why they called it Sunkist because it does have a little bit of that that sweet kind of I don't know just a little bit of a soda almost like a soda smell like the orange soda like right when you open the top of an orange soda two-liter all right guys go in on a dab of the Sunkist live resin and cake batter from canta biotics here in California this stuff is the 2015 of Jamaican High Times Magazine cannabis cup winner for best sativa concentrate cheers guys you can almost feel the Terps your nose almost more than you can taste them but then really really strong tangerine orange smokey tangi orange flavors yeah really liking the consistency on this stuff it's it's really what I come to expect from a cake batter I don't like when things are labeled cake batter and they're really crumbly and hard to get at the stuff was super nice just had a nice sponginess to it easily enabled me to get a dab off without having to deal with crumbly little pieces breaking off again that that bothers me I really don't like not the biggest crumble fan oh hi I prefer sugars and cake batters definitely in shatter yeah it's another it's another really hot day here in San Diego and I have not gotten a Dyson bladeless fan or a personal air-conditioning unit because Gavin just lazy and stupid I don't know why I didn't buy one so just a cooled down so I didn't I didn't go get one and now it's and well it's warmed up began and [ __ ] suffering anyhow Sunkist cake better this is a live resident actually guys I noticed forgot to mention I think earlier in the video but yeah a live resin cake batter and this stuff was a very reasonable donation I got it for 60 on the gram for a live resin of this quality easily would expect to pay eighty here in Southern California so yeah this stuff is absolutely flame especially for something that one the canvas Cup in 2015 for for Best sativa so yeah this stuff's a treat if you're a fan of citrus terpene profiles definitely give this one a try and you want on a second a beer guys Cheers I'm sure just let up 20 degrees in here so yeah the buzz on this stuff is super super sativa it is almost a hundred percent in my face I can feel it in my cheeks my forehead a warming sensation and and definitely it's it's that clear headed higher than the Gorilla Glue I've reviewed a couple times which is more of a hybrid sativa dominant kind of effect which is a lot more intense I would say that the tangi buzz is for lack of a better word kind of like refreshing it's kind of like a nice a daytime buzz that is totally manageable at the same time noticeable and and really just Pleasant I have my mood just shoots through the roof super glad to get a hold of this stuff thanks to buddies and TF CST here in San Diego once again bringing through the fire I love to canto biotic stuff and I was really happy to see an assortment of cake batters there they had a white Walker og bread I og what else this this Sunkist I think there might even be an orange Krush cake batter there as well so yeah just all sorts of fired it for me to go back and sample I definitely cannot wait and I can definitely feel the whole via seeing of the eyelashes yeah I can I can definitely see my lashes right now preserve eyes or splinted way closed yeah this is a really loud concentrate and and the Terps on it to like the flavor the leaves in your rig I know some some of the oils with a fruity terpene profile will leave like a really nice smell or taste in your rig and this one makes you great tastes like straight oranges like yeah if for the rest of the day if you do just a couple of dabs out of it evident herbs are really really prominent alright guys thank you for tuning in to the CCC 4:20 my name is chase and this has been turkey Tuesday episode 12 reviewing the Ken excuse me in the canna biotics alive resin the cake batter for the Sunkist which is a combination of DNA
